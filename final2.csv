1,4699,True,0.01761206235144572,"I admire the way authors and directors have fun with their readers and viewers by including scenes of great dramatic impact that are completely unexplained.The Godfather has a perfect example in the 'horse's head in bed' vignette. Implicitly we are required to believe that intruders armed with equipment to decapitate a stallion in the prime of life breezed into the stable block of what was presumably a fortified estate belonging to a movie mogul. Khartoum is somehow subdued without startling the other horses, stable lads, nightwatchmen, burglar alarms etc. His head is severed with stealth and silence. Then the slaughterers break into the movie producer's house and make their way to his bedroom, carrying the bleeding head with them. After what has already been accomplished there's no problem in placing the head under the duvet at the foot of the bed and smearing blood all over the slumberer's pyjamas, hands and face without waking him. Whistling a happy tune, perhaps, the horse butchers, recruited from afar at a moment's notice, make their exit without difficulty or detection.More nominations please for the most outrageous, impossible scene in a vaguely serious movie. I give this only 9.9 out of 10 to leave the slightest of breathing spaces for anything even more improbable."

I watched this movie for the first time in a films class I've been taking. The God Father opens with a man talking to the god father about some services. This scene has ""low key"" lighting the lighting is very dim, to show you that this is an important scene and that the god father and his client mean business. I rated The God Father 9 out of 10 because it is an outstanding movie, and keeps you guessing, even though after one thing happens you know what's going to happen next. The audiences reaches a big turn in the movie, when the god father is shot, after he's shot, his family believes he's dead. A family being apart of a mob, always calls for revenge. This movie is great and I definitely recommend it."

Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same. The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business, and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history."

The room is properly lit and the characters have a certain aura that surrounds them. You see the room is dark but the characters make the room bright. The opening scene alone is already worth the ticket. It has so much depth and emotion on the things that are happening in that world. This film shows you perfectly how respect and wit can get you through the wicked world. I recommend this to everyone who are knowledgeable and are discriminating mobsters then think too high on political figures. This film is a perfect 10/10"

Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Based on Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, the film stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning the years 1945 to 1955, centers on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while also chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone."

Of course you can see that this movie is not made this Century, but that just adds to the (call it) charm of this movie. Like Sopranos this is more about Family than the violence and mob.A genius introduction to the main characters are made. The movie starts with a wedding of Don Corleones daughter. Even if it take some time it never gets boring, and after the introduction you already know a lot of the characters in the movie. This is lacking in many modern movies. They do not use enough effort in the character building, it looses to the need of action. So much is said about the movie that I do not think I can add something to it."

Few have succeeded but the ones that followed the happening closely took advantage of it and rebuilded the age of honor. A whole book can be written for one of the greatest pictures of all time and we could not be even close to explaning how good actually it was! For those who haven't watched it yet it's a must! For those who watched it I'm sure they've watched at least a thousand times. If I must say a few words for the acting I might say that I am not among the big fans of Marlon Brando but his role in this movie is the role of his life! What can I say about Al Pacino? Genius! Only one man could have played the role of Michael Corleone and that is him! I even thing that Brian De Palma didn't think twice when he had to pick the actor for Scarface 10 years later. All the rest are on the same level and whenever we see them in other pictures we think about The Godfather. Lets just point them out - James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, John Cazale and much much more!"

This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people.

Marlon Brando is an amazing actor when he's not a big fat lazy jerk reading his lines off of a piece of paper hanging on the wall (and yes he actually did crap like that from what I heard in class) and this is one of his best performances if not the best performance he ever did. Robert Duvall and James Caan are always the same in their performances but they are good in this, probably because they are so young and their shtick wasn't old yet. Pacino is really very good. His weak brother is also very good in his role. The ladies in Pacino's life are very good. I really loved this movie, the drama is great and also there are some really great violent gangster action scenes.

The Director of Photography Gordon Willis's is considered a revolutionary person. Throughout the movie characters are shot in semi-darkness. The Studio executives were not to pleased with this but as it turns out they were wrong.

Nowadays it's an integral part of North American folk history. It depicts organized crime as a family, a respectable business, carried out under strict regulations, enforced out by the ""pater familia"" out of the respect, appreciation and authority gained among his extended family, ""the village"", while employing the respect others professed for him to preserve his authority, and yet, although perceived as last recourse, if necessary to keep his ""Family"", honor or authority safe, employing without hesitation blunt and unforgiving brute force was neither taboo nor regretted. Changes in the ""Old Ways"" are about manifest as a new younger generation (US born, and no Italian immigrants) began to take over the family business and the drugs dealing business appeared in the picture  before they were forbidden as the code didn't allow for indiscriminate damage to the ""Extended Family"" (their own people).But now it was more a question of supremacy against other ethnicities (immigrants and their descendants), who were willing to sell drugs to anyone who wanted to buy, even their own people or the ""Italo-Americans"". As they saw it, If they let them get all the pieces of this pie, the drug business which was so lucrative, they'll quickly become the most powerful and would pose a real threat to the mere existence of ""The Family"". The youngsters didn't find a solution viable other than to break the code and start dealing with drugs (even to their own ""Extended Families"", as they reasoning was that they were going to get it anyways, it'll always be better that the business remained in ""The Family"".From there on, although at first sight it may had seem everything continued like before, it really wasn't like that at all, something had broken at the very root of ""The Family"", it had changed forever and they were in a path of no return. Respect was slowly and continuously replaced by fear... And that was a one way ticket to a new era, the one of a Wounded to Death, Crumbling Empire. After watching The Trilogy and the movies Goodfellas, Once Upon a Time in America, and Scarface. If you can (have the spare time), do not miss The Sopranos (the HBO TV Series) by the also great James Gandolfini. See how a Empire can bleed to death because a wrong decision betrayed what they stood for and that changed everything so much that they lost their reason d'être."

Al Pacino who was not very popular at that time make his breakthrough performance and he is just great in the role of Michael Corleone. About the legend Marlon Brando,he is just phenomenal,his facial expressions and husky voice just make his role one of the best characters. It is based on Mario Puzo's novel about five fictional mafia families and Must say he did a great job on screenplay too. There are some great as well as shocking scenes in this movie i.e. When Woltz wake up and finds a real severed head of a horse. Sonny beats up his brother-in-law Carlo. Prolonged fight between Connie and Carlo. Death of Apollonia Vitelli-Corleone. Death scene of Sonny ambushed by gang members at toll. The killings of all the other heads of Mafia families,Moe Green,Tesiso and Carlo. I loved the setting and style. James Caan,Richard S. Castellano,Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton & Talia Shire did great jobs too. Despite the many Anachronisms,this movie is just marvelous.

The story was very solid, sent a lot of messages for interpretation, and it is truly a movie that you can watch over and over again. The classic entry to Don Corleone sends me shivers every time. The movie entices you so that you feel as if you've known these characters for a while. With that being said, it nearly broke my heart seeing Don Corleone get shot and you could feel the anger along with the rest. As Michael grew to his top dog position, you could feel the change within a second, you could immerse yourself in his world, his thoughts, and his actions (whether or not you agree with them). All in all a absolute masterpiece in which you are not allowed to die until you see this movie at least once."

It is well respected from all movie directors and inspired many actors/ filmmakers. The directing is wonderful, not to mention the acting is brilliant, cinematography perfect, and everything else about it. I personally believe that any writer/actor starting out in their careers should take the time to view the godfather and experience what a real movie is. The film itself is told in the most perfect way it could be showed. HANDS DOWN. The godfather is not in MY top 10 list of all time favorite movies, but I easily predict it to be in the top 5 best movies of all time in any poll put in front of me. 1. Citizen Cane, 2. Casablanca 3. the godfather 4. on the waterfront 5. Schindlers list"
20,4718,True,0.06904445052845787,"Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint."

Francess Ford Coppola brought to us one of the most classic movies that will be in our heart forever.

If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part- II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life.

23,4721,True,0.09220618562163345,"I am not the first, nor last to watch The Godfather and be utterly intoxicated by what is on the screen. When I first saw this film 8 years ago, I was entranced by the colorful characters, the Nino Rota score, the story and the saga. But every viewing since then brings something new. The nuanced performance of an unassuming but unflinchingly confident Al Pacino. Every time I think that they almost cast Jack Nicholson, I can't help but wonder. The way the wedding scene at the beginning lulls the audience into a sense of family, tradition and honor before putting all of it to the test in the remaining 2 hours of run time. There is no better example of crime film, drama film and acting combined with writing. The lines are rich and quotable. There is no scene that is superfluous. And once you see it, you will want to see it again and again and you will notice things every time you see it. Rarely does a filmmaker bring together this caliber of actors that bring together their characters with such color and vitality. You feel for every character on the screen and for every character who departs from the family. You feel almost that this is your family, too. That is the investment that can be made in this film....to lose one's self in its depths."
24,4722,True,0.15561506147285933,"We often hear that what the Feds nail mafiosos on is tax evasion, rather than the substantive underlying illegal commerce. What if it was antitrust instead of tax?Gangland is exactly where you'd expect to find anti-competitive behavior, working in the shadows to extract rents. After all, unfairly treated competitors can't complain to the authorities; their recourse is instead only to violence. What's more, those competitors are often themselves taken out of play by the government, whether through transparent corruption (e.g., the legislatively and executively sponsored ""war on drugs"") or through opaque corruption (e.g., bribery of corrupt cops by competing gangs). Thus, the very illegality of the products in which gangs traffic makes for government-granted monopolies that incentivize the illegal behavior.As much trouble as these monopolies and oligopolies cause for incumbents, they're even more of a headache for insurgents. Hence, barriers to entry in mob-controlled industries are high. Indeed, in Coppola's 175-minute film, there's barely a suggestion that a new family could come to compete with the five, let alone that an organization other than a family could try to enter. (There is one suggestion than an existing deputy of one of the families could do a start-up.)Relatedly, the specter of boycotting by the Corleone family is ever-present. The Godfather's office is the marketplace. Demand walks in, and the Godfather farms it out to approved suppliers of murder, maiming, extortion, etc. Hence the refrain from his lieutenants, ""Who(m) should I give this job to?"" As an antitrust defendant, Don Corleone would likely argue that this matching of buyers to sellers is a market-promoting service, see Chi. Bd. of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231 (1918)like a market maker on a securities exchangewhile prosecutors would allege that, by unilaterally choosing the supplier for each transaction, he is impeding an open market rather than lubricating it. Prosecutors would background this argument with atmospherics of racial discrimination, cf. NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886 (1982), by the Corleones qua employer; Mike says of the family attorney, ""He's a good lawyer (but n)ot a Sicilian one.""Market-splitting is rampant in The Godfather. One family controls the Bronx, another Brooklyn, and so on. In a particularly apt bit of dialog, during the epic meeting of the five families, one head refers to the United States as being split into ""territories."" This meeting is the smoking gun of collusion amongst the five families. If they could survive evidentiary challenges, such gems as Don Corleone's ""When did I ever refuse an accommodation?"" would find prominent places in the prosecution's brief.The tying in Coppola's film is blatant enough to make Yale, Hack v. Yale Corp., 237 F.3d 81 (2d Cir. 2000), or Microsoft, United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (per curiam), blush. And the ties that bind are first and foremost family ties. Hence the brilliant opening sequence of intercutting between shadowy interiors of business deals and sun-washed exteriors of the wedding, which lingers long enoughthe latter replete with multi-generational singing, dancing and tribute-payingto make us feel we're there, part of the family. The mistake of the father whose beseeching of Don Corleone opens the film was to miss this lesson. By not investing in respect for the family upfront, by forgetting that the contract with the Godfather is a deep basket of goods and services that one locks into for the long term, he insults the CEO. Only by signing up for the whole kit and caboodleincluding reciprocity of a sort and at a time to be named laterdoes he get into the club. Hence the plausibility of Mike's claim at the end of the film that he is imposing exilethe ultimate punishment by the market dominatoron his brother-in-law. Sonny's career as family head is doomed not just because he's a hothead but also because he forgets that ultimately it's all about family.All these shenanigans are ways of restraining trade. And how better to restrain trade than decapitate the $600,000 horse of a Hollywood producer who won't hire your guy and leave the head in his bed, to whack a Las Vegas developer who won't sell you his hotel, or to execute your competitors point blank under the mantle of family ties? While making offers that one figuratively can't refuse is generally market-promoting, making offers than one literally ""can't refuse"" is market-restricting.So, would going after mob commerce under the antitrust laws be an unprecedented prosecution of a monopoly that the government itself sponsored? Nope. The government unwittingly sponsors monopolists all the time, by imposing so much regulation that potential entrants don't bother. Thus the Godfather is referring to America's political organs when he says, ""I believe in America. America's made my fortune."" And he is speaking on behalf of countless regulatorily entrenched incumbentsfrom banks to taxis, Katrina Miriam Wyman, Problematic Private Property: The Case of New York Taxicab Medallions, 30 Yale J. on Reg. 125 (2013)too."

But I don't really see what's so great about it, the movie starts off boring and ends boring. I seriously cannot understand how anyone could watch through 3 hours of this crap. The movie is way to detailed, half of the stuff in the movie you don't even need to know, the acting was good and I give the storyline a meh. What ruined it all was the length and combining that with the movies boredom ruins it all. I have watched many movies, and I am a movie enthusiast, but this one does not even reach my top 50. Other movies like Stand By Me and The Green Mile etc are way better than The Godfather. Don't waste your time on this movie, its three hours of boredom. Watch Shawshank Redemption or Titanic instead.

After the first viewing about a week ago, I thought, this movie is sloppier and more sprawling than I remembered. After the second viewing, I saw how all the pieces came together to redefine the Hollywood gangster movie. The sets, lighting, sound, dialogue and the entire atmosphere really draws the viewer into the past, even if the effect romanticizes gangster life. Most of the performers seemed to bring their best stuff to their roles. But, most of the main roles could have been fleshed-out more, in the script. For example, two of the main actors, Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone and James Caan as Sonny, were very good and they could have carried more scenes. Also very good were some of the supporting actors like Richard Castellano as Clemenza, Sterling Hayden as McCluskey and especially Al Lettieri as Sollozzo. In fact, Lettieri was so compelling in his brief role as the criminal rival to the Corleone family that I wondered if he would have been better cast as the ""hero"" Michael Corleone. Which brings me to Al Pacino's portrayal of Michael: Of course Pacino is one the great actors ever, but he underplayed the role and made Michael so lacking in charm and charisma, that I found it hard, not only to like him, but to believe he could pull off the things he did, like controlling a powerful crime family or even marrying a beautiful native girl during his time in Sicily. I also found the portrayal of Tom Hagen a bit bland, probably more to do with the script than with the acting of Robert Duvall. Hagen was supposed to be an adopted family member, who was brought into the family as a boy and raised like a son and brother. Yet throughout the whole film, he never gets out of lawyer mode. Even actual lawyers frequently stop being a lawyer for a few minutes here and there. A few scenes were a bit superfluous, particularly those featuring Diane Keaton as Michael's fiancé (maybe I'm just biased against Diane Keaton), but the Godfather is worth sitting through more than once.Disclaimer: I never read the book by Mario Puzo. This review only concerns the film itself, independent of the source material."
27,4725,True,0.15639381680358655,"This is a masterpiece of modern film-making. Coppola has managed to make his audience care about a Mafia crime dynasty, as we follow the inevitable transition of power from the venerable Don Vito Corleone (Brando) to the youngest of his three sons Michael (Pacino). This was something that the ageing Don never wanted for Michael, wanting to see him legitimised as a Senator or a Governor, but fate and the violent nature of their chosen profession steps in. Impulsive and violent eldest son Sonny (Caan) is duped and gunned down in a drug war, and middle son Fredo is overlooked as he is just not Don material. Michael, however, is his father's son, and his path into the family business is partially forced on him after an attempt on his father's life. Humiliated and beaten by the New York Chief of Police (who is in the pocket of a rival mafia Family), his life changes when he makes a character defining decision to take revenge on both the Police Chief and a rival narcotics trafficker named Sollozo, who, having made the attempt on the Don's life, must now see it through or forever be a marked man. Michael completes the task with a steely eyed determination, and murders both men in a chilling scene in a family restaurant. Michael is then forced to flee the USA to hide in Sicliy under the protection of a friendly Mafia family. His character is further developed after he falls in love with and marries a beautiful Sicilian peasant girl, who is mistakenly murdered when his enemies track him down to Sicily. When Michael returns to America, he is not the same man that sat in his sister's wedding celebration at the start of the movie. He is older, wiser and surrounded as he has been by death and betrayal, those intervening years have been crucial to his character development. Like his father before him, he has chosen his path and has become a Don in waiting. This is an accolade that the older Don Corleone does not wait long to pass on to him, and although the old Don is still alive (surviving the five bullets Sollozo's assassins hit him with) he hands over the reins of power to Michael. Michael, now at the head of the business, accelerates the nefarious activities of the family. He seeks to relocate them to Nevada, but must tie up his New York business, split his territory between his Lieutenants Tessio and Clemenza fairly and settle old scores first. He uses his father as Consigliari, and Tom Hagen, the Families lawyer and Consigliari is quickly sidelined both because, as Michael tells him, he is not a wartime Consigliari, and because he needs his hands clean after the family re-settle in Nevada. The Assassination / Baptism scene is unparallelled, as Michael cuts down his enemies with a ruthlessness that maybe even the old Don did not possess, perhaps the reason why he stepped aside. These scenes are an interlinked series of brutal murders as Michael wipes the slate clean and assassinates anyone and everyone who have opposed the family. The genius is that the murders are interspersed with cutbacks to Michael standing as Godfather to his sister Connie's child, in Church, renouncing evil and Satan, as his Capo's and button men rampage through the remaining heads of the other five families. It is truly breathtaking film making. There has never been a better or stronger collection of actors ever assembled for any film before or since, and the dialogue is as memorable as anything ever committed to the page. There are no weak spots in this movie and the point to consider is that even though this is a film made against the background of crime and violence, and these play a huge part in what unfolds, it is essentially a film about family and loyalty. When the Corleone's decide to take murderous revenge on the heads of the other families, you do not turn from the screen at the savagery which is undoubtedly there to be seen, but instead, you root for Michael to be successful. There are simply too many memorable scenes to recount, but the final scene played out immediately after Michael orders that a Doctor be called for Connie because she is quite rightly hysterical (he has had her husband Carlo garroted out of revenge for Sonny's death) where Kay watches Michael's Capo's pay homage to him by kissing his hand/ring, while his Chief assassin, Neri slowly and deliberately closes the door in her face is the best ending in cinema history. I will end by stating that the Godfather II, is, if it were possible, even better. You will not regret watching this movie. It will stay with you for a long time after the final credits have rolled."

But you can't escape from the fact that you love Don Corleone(Marlon Brando). The scene that he cries after his son(Sonny)died,made me cry. And I think that's what a movie is all about,You love the bad guys,because They're Good! I guess the Director some how skips the ""back together part"" when Micheal and Kay get back together!Or Apolonia(Mike's first wife in the movie)'s death. I guess it was for shortening the movie,or maybe it just Doesn't matter. But Francis Ford Coppola could shorten another scenes. It was a great movie after all,maybe the greatest, I voted 9."
29,4727,True,0.0945182000584255,"What can I say, an outstanding movie, certainly the best that I have ever seen.The Godfather depicts organised crime in a way that no other film ever has, or ever will. Although there is violence, it is put in very discretely- instead choosing to focus on the Italian family values that the Godfather and his heir, Michael, have adopted. It is a beautiful portrait of a seemingly happy family, with dark secrets. Eventually, the family suffers because of their underworld status, and Michael Corleone eventually takes over the family, with all of his father's wisdom, but with the ruthlessness of his late brother. The direction and the acting of the Michael character is exceptional. Al Pacino portrays him perfectly, and Francis Ford Coppola masterfully directed his transition from family rebel and sweet Westernised man to aggressive and ruthless kingpin of the family business.The music is another pivotal part of the movie. Nino Rota's famous main theme of the Godfather will stick in anybody's head for the remainder of their life. The lighting is also very well done, with the dark orange colour which adds to the overall effect of the movie.All in all, a brilliant masterpiece, with no flaws whatsoever, 10 out of 10."
30,4728,True,0.024875556304686314,"I absolutely loved this movie. It offers a unique view of the mafia and its workings from within the organization. It shows them as real people, not the heartless, emotionless criminals everyone makes them out to be. They aren't petty thugs like most criminals you see running around today. The Godfather is unique because it shows these criminals as having a sense of honor and dignity. Everything done is strictly business, nothing more. It has plenty of action and drama to keep me wanting more. Something about the way this movie is done, the way the actions are done out, the way the mafia is portrayed as operating, keeps me coming back to this movie, keeps me wanting to see more. I absolutely love this movie and will watch it again and again."

This movie goes exactly what you must have imagined while reading the book. This is the only movie that has every thing in it drama, thriller, romance and action actually you can say this is made for all type of audience in the world. There was so many characters whom i did not like while reading the book but i loved it while watching the movie i saw it to late but if you have not seen it yet then you must watch it this will not waste your time instead you will learn a lot. This movie is the perfect example of film making."
32,4730,True,0.13508647203157115,"The Godfather is one of those movies that could be considered perfect or near perfect. It's a perfect ten in just about every category of what makes a great film: Cinematography, story, character development, action sequences, acting, plot twists...this movie is an absolute masterpiece. There's no clichés or corny moments, no annoying, useless characters, and its about as original as it comes in all aspects of story. The Corleone family is both evil and moral, both sympathetic and begging for hatred, both understandable and from another world. Vito Corleone is a ruthless crime boss, but at the same time, has standards and a sense of right and wrong. Michael Corleone goes from being a war hero who claims that he is not his family, to a mafia don more ruthless than his father. Sonny, his older brother, is a loose cannon, but with method to his madness. Every time I watch this movie, I ask myself: How did Coppola and Puzo do it? How can this movie be described as anything except perfect? If I have ANY gripe with The Godfather, at the toll booth, there's no way that somebody could take that many rounds and still not be incapacitated. Yeah, people don't always drop with one round in real life, but fifteen guys opening up on full auto with .45 ACP rounds from a Tommy Gun is going to kill pretty damn quickly! But I'm a gun nut, so that's a nit pick. That, I guess knocks the Godfather down to about a 9.999999999999999999 out of 10!"
33,4731,True,0.08855541449366576,"I mean, really, what hasn't been said about this film yet? That's right, nothing, and so I'll now write a review that doesn't go anywhere.There are those that say this (or maybe pt2) is the best movie ever made, but I couldn't agree with that. One of the best, yes, but not the best. And then you have those who say it's overrated and boring. I think those people are just not used to extremely long movies anymore, and that's sad, because these people are missing out on some other awesome long movies (casino, GF 1,2,3, Heat, Once upon a time in the west, etc.) Anyway, back to the movie. It was the breakthrough for several great actors, including Marlon Brando, in the brilliant role of the compassionate but cruel Don Corleone, and Al Pacino of course, in the role of Michael, the Don's son who didn't want to take over the Corleone empire at first but in the end does anyway. When I fist sat down to see this movie it was with thoughts of 'overrated' and 'way too long', but the 2h55 just flew by, really. Though it was the longest movie I'd ever seen, it felt no longer than say Inception, which is 30min shorter and (in my opinion) a really boring movie, and at the end I couldn't wait for pt2, so it was a convenience that I had it standing right next to me in my DVD-rack."
34,4732,True,0.12629313218646654,"Besides romanticizing the idea of being a mobster, the movie marks the end of an era and the beginning of a new idea. The whole concept is the patriarch of this mobster family seeing the end of a profit for innocent leisure activities such as gambling and running molasses when new mobsters want in on the narcotics business which is just dirty business since it involves addiction and not just plain drinking and gambling. The viewer sees how the old ideals of the 1920s which are embodied with the Don conflict with the new ideals of the 1950s which is the business of narcotics. It is an epic of the Don's youngest son, Michael, how he refuses the idea of being a part of the family and how his love for his father forces him to be more ruthless and calm than his father and his brother, since he takes action right away by killing Solozzo and the police captain for being corrupt and to top it off kills off the heads of the five families just to solidify the Corleone family power. This is the essential mobster movie since solidifies the idea of an organized crime effort with the Boss, the Underbosses who are next in line, the Capo Regime and the soldiers modeled after the Roman Empire as mentioned in Part II by Tom Hagen. While the sequel is arguably one of the best sequels of all time, the original excels in showcasing how this mobster empire conflicted with new ideals but came up on top with nothing but ruthlessness and calm precision by Michael."
35,4733,True,0.1287646925545927,"I think The Godfather is very well-made and a good film on the whole; very well-acted, well-scored, and had effective dialogue, but I think it's somewhat overrated.This is the story it TRIED to tell........Michael Corleone is the son of Sicilian Mafia Don Vito Corleone. Unlike his siblings, he wants nothing to do with the family business, and his father wouldn't have it any other way. After getting back from WWII, he wants to shield his girlfriend Kay from his family. But when a rival to Vito named Sollozzo comes along, a chain of events is set into motion that culminates in Vito's life hanging in the balance. Although he wanted nothing to do with the business, he decides to kill those who are a threat to Vito out of love for his father. By so doing, he forced himself to live in exile in Sicily for 3 years, where he learns more of the family/Sicilian tradition, and gets married. Soon after the death of his new wife Apollonia, he was able to return to the US and is reunited with Kay. Only he isn't the same man who she knew from before; he is very much a part of the family business, and indeed is the actual head of the mafia. He wants Kay to marry him, but not so much because he loves her as because of his newly-found Sicilian beliefs in the importance of family. He is now cold and ruthless in the way he deals with his enemies, and by the end of the film, he became the very sort of person that he wanted nothing to do with at the beginning of the movie.This is how the story came across to me..........Michael Corleone is the son of Sicilian Mafia Don Vito Corleone. Unlike his siblings, he wants nothing to do with the family business, and his father wouldn't have it any other way. After getting back from WWII, he wants to shield his girlfriend Kay from his family. The movie does a dismal job in establishing this, and also does a dismal job in establishing the Michael/Kay relationship. Other than a few lines in the opening wedding scene, we never really got to know Michael back when he was a good man, and we hardly saw any of Michael/Kay together back when their relationship was healthy. So then he kills Sollozzo & that cop, runs to Sicily, then gets hit ""by the thunderbolt"" of Apollonia, whom I found to be very annoying. So we get a montage of Michael's life in Sicily (seen while some very nice music is playing), and all of a sudden he wholeheartedly embraces the Sicilian way of family, mob, etc. Michael comes back to America a changed man, and the film finishes with the process of his transformation being complete, but because of the poor job the film did in establishing who he was prior to the events of the movie, and how the change itself actually happened, Michael becoming what he once opposed ended up having very little impact on me.Still, a good movie on the whole, with some great scenes like the restaurant shooting and the front yard talk between Michael & Vito."
36,4734,True,0.05341257195642021,"This is by far the greatest movie of all time. The only bad thing I can say about this film is that I now have to compare every film I see to it and it is never close. The incredible acting and directing are all the best but it is the story that catches you and doesn't let go. The is a movie about family. Honestly is you replace Mafia with domestic violence, alcoholism, anything it would still work. I still to this day have to look over my shoulder whenever I eat an orange. I honestly think this will be one of the only movies that will never be remade due to the world exploding as a result. I love this movie and encourage all I meet to watch it again and again. Whens the last time you invited me over for coffee?"
37,4735,True,0.07362826319491717,"Though I don't think The Godfather should be the #2 movie on the top 250, I understand it's importance to the industry. I understand that there's more depth in The Godfather than most movies of the time. I don't know, I keep a pretty open mind to movies and the different eras they were made in. 1970-1980 just isn't a popular decade for me. So far, The Godfather series is probably the best thing to come out of this era (or at least the first two). It's a pretty big hit. I loved it. I just didn't love it as much as the movie masses do even to this day. The story is rich, and Vito Corleone is easily one of my favorite characters of all time now. The death scenes are brutal and hard-hitting. The director didn't waste a single gunshot or strangulation for the sake of just doing it. There's a method to the madness of The Godfather, and I guess thats' why it hits people so hard. They story is built up in a way to where the killing of a character hits just as hard as your favorite character leaving the cast of your favorite sitcom.The scene in the garden with Don Vito and his grandson is by far my favorite. Out of all the ways I'd expect it to happen, It took me by surprise. It was a very sweet and heartfelt scene, and the character was too worthy of it. I would've been angry if Vito ended as a victim, and not the legend... the Godfather.Check this movie out. There's a good reason why it's such an important movie to the industry. Other than that - it's just a fantastic piece of cinema, and touches on a few topics we can all relate to: Honor, Nobility, and Family."
38,4736,True,0.0977878361174906,"WARNING! SPOILERS EVERYWHERE!The beginning of The Godfather is both horrifying and engrossing. The first shot is in a dark room, as a man speaks to Vito Corleone (Brando) of an appalling attempted rape on his daughter. The criminals have escaped American justice, but he wants (what he considers) real justice to be done. As it is his daughter's wedding day, Corleone (as a Sicilian) mustn't refuse a reasonable request. And thus, the opening scene of the film plunges the viewer directly into what is one of the most respected movies of all time.And yet, as effective as this move is, it can also be extremely confusing. As a non-Italian viewer, the sudden immersion into Italian culture created a disconcerting effect.Thankfully, for a film that is nearly three hours long, The Godfather has plenty of action going on, spanning 10 years, yet rarely becoming boring. Unfortunately, when it does become boring, it is because Coppola falls into the trap he fell into with Apocalypse Now: too much side material makes the plot irrelevant. His muddled concept of suspense at times left me completely bored. The Mafia is often treated as a bureaucracy, with men in tight suits pledging loyalty to each other, then promptly killing each other. Many of these scenes end up being ineffective.Incidentally, it is curious that although the central characters of The Godfather are members of the Mafia, the viewer somehow sympathises with them. Why? I believe I've found the answer. We never see the individual victims of crime. We never see women reduced to prostitution, a family broken up by gambling, drugs ruining a man's life. The only cop we see with speaking lines is corrupt, and promptly killed off. Although the characters are, at heart, immoral, the effects of their immorality are limitedly shown. And this might be why the characters have such appeal: instead of gangsters, they become a dysfunctional family. Thus, The Godfather, often dismissed as a thriller, is most aptly classified as a drama.For me, one of the (if not the) best scenes in the entire film is when Michael (Pacino) attends his sister's son's baptism, where he stands as the godfather. As the priest asks him whether he renounces Satan and all his works (etc.), Michael answers ""I do"". In a masterfully inter-cut scene (kudos to Coppola), this moment of the baptism is shown to take place simultaneously as several murders Michael has arranged. The juxtaposition of these two moments is highly effective (much more so, in my humble opinion, than the brutal execution of Carlo minutes later), and is one of the moments that make The Godfather the oh-so-sweet treat it is.However, despite being one of the most respected movies of all time, The Godfather undeniably is flawed (gasps!). There are so many characters to keep track of, that several of them remain sketched-in shadows. In addition, Coppola has thrown in a subplot about Michael's life in Sicily after he flees America, which is not only ineffective, but also slows down the tone of the film, and brings in doubts over just how much Michael loves his wife, a situation affirmed when he lies to her at the film's end, denying his involvement in the murders. It just feels stiff, awkward, out-of-place, and slows down the film. And of course, I think that Michael ordering his sister's husband to be killed is possibly the film's biggest flaw. Michael shows positively no concern for Connie: his only thought is to avenge his brother. Well, this relentless circle of vengeance gets dizzying at times.When it comes to acting, there's practically no argument. The Godfather is one of the best-cast films ever. Marlon Brando in particular works well. (Nay, I'll revise that-- he IS the Godfather.) His final scene, as he dies playing with his grandson, works precisely because of Brando's acting.The score for The Godfather was composed by Nino Rota, and a very effective score it was! The theme in particular seemed to melancholically say: ""If only we had listened to the Godfather"" Finally, I find it fascinating how, with subtlety, later events in the film are foreshadowed. The most brilliant case of foreshadowing occurs when a film studio boss (whose name completely escapes me) shows off his prize horse, boasting of its price and how he plans not to race it. This serves as such a clever way of foreshadowing the (gruesome, yet effective) slaughter of the horse.The Verdict: Although The Godfather is undeniably a very good movie, it has been overrated, emphasis put on its good points, yet its flaws shockingly overlooked. It's currently #2 on IMDb's Top 250-- but it should, in my humble opinion, be a lot further down the list.Overall Rating: 6.5/10"
39,4737,True,0.06932404515012311,"The Godfather has to be one of the most masterful and perfect films of all time. Francis Ford Coppola does a great job in directing by creating great suspense and drama in the film as well as the dark theme meant in the book. Mario Puzo did a wonderful job in turning his best-selling book into a movie script with a little help from Coppola. This film also introduces some of the greatest actors in the crime genre which includes great performances by Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. The beginning of the film is the only part that I hated because it was so long and boring too but I guess there was probably no other way to begin the movie I guess. I like how they show a lot of the Italian and mafia culture in the film but they do tend to mistake a lot of mob culture. First of I looked at the film and the guys don't ever talk like mob guys. In the real mafia everyone curse including the higher ranking and elder bosses. I surprised by the lack of profanity in the movie and I think the only I time I ever heard a curse word is when Sonny said the ""N"" word at the dinner table which I have no clue why he said it because it was so random. Also they get rid of a lot of power away from the Captains of the capo-regimes. I never heard much talk of the business from Tessio or Clemenza which is really is out of the mob ranking style. Also despite this being a great mafia movie they don't make the mobsters cruel enough. I mean come on we all know that these guys are monsters and murderers make them look that rather than some fat guys who are rich and love eating cake. Well one thing they did get right was the asking favors thing with the Don and screw him for not getting into drugs. Overall I'll recommend this movie to anyone but please don't judge by the boring beginning please see the whole movie before you judge it."

It's as though the actors were born for the roles. Especially everyone in the Corleone family... you find they act totally like a family. The best performance for me was Brando as Vito Corleone. He brought such a presence to the character that it's astonishing... basically unbelievable. The rest of the cast does a great job. Al is extremely convincing as the youngest son of the don. The only thing people have to realize is that the mafia in no way act like this. I mean, ""The Godfather"" is a very romantic or Shakespearean look at this world. Even though all the characters DO eventually pay for their sins. Francis Ford Coppola once said ""I always thought of THE GODFATHER as the story of a great king with three sons. The oldest was given his sweet nature and childlike qualities; the second, his passion and aggressiveness; and the third, his cunning and coolness.""I wholeheartedly agree."

You have Michael swearing to renounce Satan in the church while his minions are slaughtering men on the street, under his orders.Here is Pacino as Michael who in his own right is just so downright haunting. He is a man who has literally damned himself, and is forever tortured. Seeing, his character go from the war hero marine to the haunted and isolated Mafia Don..... Wow.Brando. Again. Wow. That scene with him and Duvall where, Don Vito is told by a broken-hearted Tom that Sonny has been killed, and Michael's involvement in the murders. Or that final exchange between Vito & Michael. The dialogue is so un-forced, so natural, so real - gives me goosebumps! The most touching scene, for me, are the scenes between Michael and Apollonia, the local Sicilian girl who he falls in love with. And how couldn't he? ""Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday..."" She was so innocent.All in all, my favorite scene I think is the scene in the Italian restaurant, leading up to Michael's murder of Sallozzo and McCluskey --Pacino's performance in that scene is just off the charts-- you can almost feel his mounting stress and blood pressure right through the screen."
42,4740,True,0.14528170518428374,"I must've seen this movie more than a hundred times over the past seven years or so, but I still can't get enough of it. It was released in 1972 and there is hardly any doubt in my mind that it has truly stood the test of time. It is a brilliant adaptation of the bestseller novel 'The Godfather' by Mario Puzo.The Godfather is a gangster movie set in the late 1940s & early 1950s around the lives of the Corleone family. Corleones are an Italian American Family in New York headed by 'Don' Vito Corleone. Vito has three sons, Sonny, Fredo & Michael and a daughter named Connie who is married to Carlo Rizzi. He also has an adopted son named Tom Hagen (German-Irish) who is the 'Consiglerie'(Advisor) of the family. The family is into the business of gambling, unions & liquor. They have all the judges and politicians 'in their pocket'. The Corleones also have influences over the media & the cops. They form a crime syndicate of 5 Italian- American families who have a stronghold over different parts of New York. Vito is assisted in his work by his 'Caporagemes' namely Clemenza & Tessio who carry out his orders.The family is faced with problems when the refusal of Don Vito to join & support the drug business along with Virgil Sollozo leads to other families (Barzini, Tattaglia, Stracchi & Cuneo) going against them. The bad blood between the families results in Don Vito getting shot. Sonny, (The 'hothead')who is the eldest son gets killed and Michael has to step-up in this time of need. The emergence of Michael who was earlier reluctant to join the family business as the head of the family is the highlight of the movie. Michael imbibes all the unique qualities of his father and takes revenge for his family. I don't know where to begin with as far as appreciating this movie is concerned. It has the most amazing characterizations with all the characters being well etched and having their own individuality. If Vito was the 'reasonable man' who valued his family, Sonny is a hot head, Michael is rational, Fredo is weak & stupid, Tom is measured, Sollozo is ruthless. Even the supporting cast of Clemenza, Tessio, Don Barzini, Connie, Captain Mcklusky, Jhonny Fontaine,Jack Woltz,Mama etc are extremely well defined. The dialogues in the movie pack some serious punch. Some of them which I can recall on my fingertips are "" It's not personal Sonny, its strictly business"", "" Only don't tell me that you are innocent , because it insults my intelligence & it makes me very angry"" and finally "" I'll make him an offer he cannot refuse"". The screenplay seamlessly gels with the movie. Who can forget the scene at the Louis restaurant, the baptism scene at the end, or Tom Hagen informing his Don about Sonny's death. The movie has got this whole Italian milieu which takes you in a different world, makes you feel like a member of the Corleone family and identify with each and every character. Last but not the least, a tribute should be paid to the entire cast of the movie. No one could have acted better than Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, Al Pacino as Michael, James Caan as Sonny or Robert Duvall as Tom. Even the performance of the supporting cast is phenomenal.I would like to sincerely thank Francis Coppola for putting up such a gem of a movie which has really caught my imagination."

45,4743,True,0.15837482991992236,"The Godfather is considered a landmark achievement in film and considered by many as one of the greatest film of all time. The plot of the movie is a little hard to explain because the movie misleads the viewer and goes somewhere else but little by little the pieces add up together. The story begins with a bunch of people coming to the mafia Don, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) for some requests because ""The Don can't refuse an offer to a Sicilian on the day of his daughters wedding."" At the wedding we are introduced the Corleone family which include Santino or Sonny Corleone (James Caan) the oldest of the family and the most hotheaded member, Fredo the second oldest who is a womanizer and isn't as smart as the other members of his family, then there is Michael played by Al Pacino who is a WWII veteran who comes to his sister's wedding with his girlfriend Kay and tells her how he doesn't want to become like the others in his family. Then is Tom Haygin (Robert Duvall) the non Italian character who was taken in by Vito Corleone as a son and become the consiliere (or head of legal affairs) and then there is of course Connie (The Don's Daughter) who is marrying a man named Carlo. The beginning of the story focuses on a famous singer Johnny Propane coming to Vito Corleone asking him for help to get cast in a film, soon Tom goes there and ends up ""forcefully"" making the Director accept Johnny Propane. From there things become a little difficult when Vito Corleone refuses to get in the business of narcotics with a heroin dealer named Virgil Sollozzo. After Vito's refusal he is shot and nearly killed when his shot down by Sollozzo's men. Without much hope Tom is taken hostage and tries to get hotheaded Sonny to take a deal with Sollozzo but when he refuses things become worse as a possibility of an all out war with the other 5 heads of family become visible. Then Michael takes his role in the story when he visits his father and realizes their isn't security before he is beaten by the corrupt Captain McCluskey. After the incident Michael offers to kill Sollozzo and McCluskey who they realize are working together and in a climatic scene Michael takes out a loaded gun and kills both McCluskey and Sollozzo. Without any hope Michael is forced to move to Sicily to be safe guarded for a while. There he meets a girl named Apollonia and she is soon killed in a car bomb in a near assassination on Michael's life because of the crime's he's committed. Things start to fall apart as the Don finally returns home and Sonny goes on to beat Carlo after he beats on his sister Connie. However when Carlo beats Connie again, Sonny is aggravated and goes to beat up Carlo again before getting murdered at a toll booth by an army of gunmen. After the death of Sonny, Vito Corleone decides to go with the five heads of the mafia to make a truce, soon Michael returns now that it's safe and returns to Kay his girlfriend and tells her he wants to marry her. With Sonny dead, the Don almost retired and Fredo in Vegas (being incompetent to take care of family affairs). Michael soon reduces Tom's power and makes Carlo his right hand man when they move their operations to Nevada. When visiting Vegas, Michael goes to a casino which is financed by The Corleone's and run by Moe Greene where Michael tells Moe that he plans on buying him out much to his dismay. Later Michael returns back home where he talks with the Don and the Don tells him that an associate close to him will betray him and kill him. Soon after the Don plays with his grandson (Michael's son) he dies of a heart attack. During the funeral Michael discovers that Tessio was the traitor and soon has him along with Moe Greene and the heads of the mafia all wiped out during the baptism of Connie's child. Afterwards Michael goes to Carlo's house where he questions him on Sonny's murder before wiping him out. The movie ends with Connie angry at Michael for Carlo's death but Michael seems not to care and when Kay asks him if this is what he does for a living, Michael tells her he doesn't. However it's obvious she realizes that Michael is becoming more what he was afraid of."

(Don Corleone) If you put the Godfather in front of me two years ago i would have told you to get lost. I never watched the film until a year ago and i realised that it wasn't some religious film but one of the most powerful movies ever made. The more i watched it the more i liked it and i believe that i have watched it more then fifty times over the past year. I recommend that if you have not watched it yet you need to get down to the nearest video store and hire it out.My favourite character in the film would have to be Michael. A war hero and a college boy until he decides that his destiny is to be in the family business. Through out the movie you will notice that he changes from a nice full of life college boy to a smooth, cool mafia don. Al Pacino portrays Michael very well and this was the role that made Pacino famous.Other characters are Sonny played by James Cann, Tom Hagen played by Robert Duvall, Fredo played by John Cazale and of course Don Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando. All of these people including Michael Corleone are the family. Brando does an excellent job as the old Don who is wise and powerful and is really the main character. James Cann is the bad tempered Sonny who has a hard time thinking before he acts. Throughout the movie you will like Sonny and you will feel peed off when something bad happens to him. Tom Hagen is the unofficially adopted son of Vito Corleone and the family consiligerie (Can't spell it) who is the brains of the family along with the Don. Fredo is unfortunately the useless son who does not have an idea about what he is doing. Then there are other characters throughout the film like Clemenza, Tessio, Rocco, Al Neri and heaps more.The movie is about an aging mafia don who refuses to start a business with narcotics but there are four other families in New York who have an interest. An assassination attempt is made on the Don but he does not die. Sonny Who is short tempered takes over the family while the Don is still recovering and wants revenge. The Dons youngest Michael who is the only one who wishes not to be in the business decides that he must stick with his father and kill a crooked cop and Sollozo. The movie starts out in 1945 and carries on to 1955 showing the war of the five families and Michaels rise to Don.This movie is directed very well by Francis Ford Coppola and is definitely a must see for everyone."

BrillianceThen of course comes the scene with the horses head in the bed of director Woltz. This is probably the most memorable scene in the film for me.Then comes the attempted murder of Don Corleone. Sonny is killed at a toll. Michael's new wife is blown up in a car bomb.

It is not your typical movie that you can figure out everything from the beginning or almost from it. Here if you are really really smart and maybe know a bit about the plot may figure something out but in general the movie is leading you. There is nothing which is stupid in this movie! but you have to be concentrated not to miss any part because everything is so integral in realising what was what!********************************* POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING BELOW!!! *********************************one thing is easy to figure out though carlo set-up sonny that was obvious ;)

It really is tough to decide between the first 2 for the greatest, but i do think that this just has a slight edge, and i am also a huge fan of the 3rd, but its not quite in the same league. I just think that it's really mindblowing how awesome Marlon Brando is in this movie. That is probably the most deserved Best Actor Award ever, as this movie is probably the greatest Best Picture winner ever.Basically this movie is about organised crime, or the mafia, or cosa nostra or whatever you want to call it. I can see how some may think that it glorifies the world of organised crime, but i really don't think that that makes any difference at all. A really basic overview of the story is that Michael Corleone (Al Pacino in one of his greatest roles ever, alongside the other Godfather movies and Scarface) is involuntarily drawn into the world of organised crime when his father, Vito ""The Don/The Godfather"" Corleone (Marlon Brando) gets gunned down in the street. Of course there are a thousand small loops involved, like the whole Sonny, Connie and Carlo triangle and Tom Hagen (beautifully portrayed by Robert Duvall) is important as well.I don't think i could ever get over this movie, as it is one of the most brilliant things i have ever seen."

I finally got down to watching the series last night and it has become my favorite movie trilogy of all time now. Everything about this movie is impeccable. The acting by Brando and Pacino is magnificent, and the storyline never lets up, constantly keeping you engulfed in whats going on within the Corleone family. Pacino does a magnificent job in particular, as he is the cool, calm and level-headed son of the Don in the first film, and he makes a transition between this film and Godfather 2 into the ruthless cold-hearted mob boss."

The cast is incredible, the acting is above average, and the movie itself makes it hard to believe that it made it's debut in 1972.It also gives us an unforgettable line from Marlon Brando that is now known throughout the world- ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.""To call this movie overrated is a real shame; it is (in my opinion and in many others) the greatest 'mafia movie' ever made. Mario Puzzo and Francis Ford Coppola should be very proud men after making a movie of this caliber."
52,4750,True,0.110387320987568,"The key to the success of this defining gangster movie is the faultless casting. All the characters are strong and eminently believable. The central masterpiece is, of course, Brando's Don Corleone, a feudal mafia warlord of the old school who can distribute largess or initiate mayhem with no more than a mumbled whisper to his ever-attentive mobster acolytes. Excellent performances from Al Pacino , James Caan, and Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden as the tough, bad cop and one of my favorite screen thugs, Al Lettieri as ""The Turk"" Solozzo. A fairly predictable plot, even if you haven't first read the book , but so what? Its not meant to be a mystery. We the audience KNOW that the enemies of the family are going to get what's coming to them by way of the usual methods, and the director does not disappoint us. The traditional christening juxtaposed with the scenes of vengeful carnage are a masterful touch.Is it possible to be a good son of the Church and a mass murderer all at the same time ? The director poses this question to us and we are discomforted. We have to take on board the new reality that not ALL mobsters are flamboyant psychopaths in the erstwhile Hollywood tradition of James Cagney, Edward G Robinson etc; doomed to perish in a hail of police bullets or in the electric chair. The mafia boss could be the family man next door, the theme picked up and carried to new heights in ""The Sopranos"". At the end of ""The Godfather"", we are left in no doubt that Michael Corleone and his henchmen are highly unlikely to be brought to book for their crimes, and more to the point, we the audience don't mind this one bit.In that respect, that is probably the secret to this films enduring popularity everywhere in the World that it has been screened. Al Pacino's Michael Corleone defends his family and protects their livelihood by doing the hard yards and making the tough decisions. We can all identify with that, but in balance, we are also presented with the down side of Michael's effectiveness as a mob boss. His brother-in-law is dispatched without mercy and he lies without remorse to his wife. These themes were effectively developed in ""The Godfather Pt 2"", which is mostly concerned with the subsequent and inevitable degradation of Michael's humanity, culminating in fratricide. The violence depicted in ""The Godfather"" was extreme at the time of its release and still has the power to shock. This is no bad thing as the mayhem is fully in context with the plot and is in no way glamorized. Real gangsters DO commit horrible crimes and often die in their turn bleeding in a gutter.R. B."

The different characters of everyone: Sonny, the relentless and ruthless one, who comes to a very sticky end, Michael, The reluctant, yet unforgiving son, who goes onto great things, although he just wants the business to be legitimate, and Don Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, that man can act, a family centred character, Vito Corleone did what he saw necessary to keep his family afloat and in line with the other families."

56,4754,True,0.10735758058197578,I thought i might as well watch this film as it is hailed as one of the best films ever. The film lived up to all my expectations and it is truly amazing.The film is about the Corleone family's crime rings in the mid 40s-50s. It shows the families descent into more and more serious crime. The number of quotable lines is massive just showing how cool it is as well. Once your hooked on the film you wont look away and wont leave your seat once. The acting by Marlon Brando is so convincing that you could believe he really was a mafia don. The film is said to be violent but to be honest there is little violence in it and the violence is very mild. This is a good thing though because if it was too violent it wood spoil the film.
57,4755,True,0.10591696957677448,"""I will make you an offer you cannot refuse."" said by Don Vito Corleone in The GodFather.Well the setting of this intense movie is in New York where all the big 5 families or 5 different mafia families live in... The movie starts off in New York but slowly the setting moves to several different places in the United States. For example California and Las Vegas are two places where the Corleone family went to make deals with people. First of all i have to say the roles of the characters were played very well especially how the godfather uses he's accent and the way he acts in he's role makes it seem more realistic to how most people think of the mafia. I also think that Al Pacino did a very good job in playing the role of his character making him seem like a man who is not interested in the family business but has to step up to take revenge and take control of the family so that he's family members will not die. The costumes that the characters dress in suited the setting very well because the setting was not modern, but was in the past. Also the way people in each setting acted represented a lot like how much people would act when someone was killed because most people would be scared to get interfered with the mafia families. i think that this film is a very well directed and acted film and is a movie that must be seen because it is almost an once in a life time experience that can change one's thinking of what goes on in the world. As must one say the old cliché ""smell the flowers."" (notice little things around you)"
58,4756,True,0.14533213090711827,"The original ""Godfather"" is the granddaddy (or maybe ""goddaddy"") of them all. Followed up by two good sequels, the 1972 first film was the best. If we could have understood Marlon's mumblings it might have been even better! Al Pacino is terrific as young Michael Corleone, youngest son of Don Vito, played by Brando, who, all kidding about his dialogue delivery aside, gives an astonishing portrayal of a crime kingpin, a loving family man, a shrewd businessman and a loyal friend but a murderous enemy. My favorite performance, though, is James Caan as the fiery, hot tempered big brother, Sonny, Who is riddled by Tommy guns at a toll plaza ambush by rival gangsters. John Cazale is Fredo, the middle brother, who's not nearly as sharp or ruthless as the rest of the family. Talia Shire does very well in a pivotal role as the Don's only daughter, Connie. Robert Duvall is outstanding as the family consigliere, Tom Hagen, the Don's adopted son and legal adviser. Diane Keaton is very good as Kay, who will enter the family as Michael's wife, and discover the less appealing aspects of her husband and his family business. Richard S. Castellano and Abe Vigoda are both exceptional as the godfather's lieutenants. The plot is well documented in other posts, so I won't recap it here. The thing to remember is that all the people depicted are either criminals or beneficiaries of criminal activities, while they often show virtues, they are corrupted by money and power. This is a complex and moving film, filled with great lines, unforgettable characters and action. A worthy choice for #1 in this list, or any other."

This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart.I have never read the novel but I am sure I will pick it up.

61,4759,True,0.1000231178404619,"""The Godfather"" is much, much more than a great film - it's a legendary film, regarded by thousands as the greatest ever made. And its continual reign at the top of the IMDb.com top 250 proves this. There have been so many reviews written about this movie and its subsequent sequels, so much written about it - not only here on this website but in magazines, books, universities, the whole caboodle - that someone like me has to be careful that their review doesn't go over too much old ground and become boring. Unfortunately, to a large extent, ""The Godfather"" is famous for people being unanimous about what makes it so good and so I will probably have to repeat what countless others have said.Certainly one can not fault the story itself - a magnificent tale of life in the Mafia and, in particular, of the development of the youngest son of Don Corleone (Marlon Brando), Michael (Al Pacino). The screenplay, adapted by Mario Puzo and Coppola from Puzo's own novel, is a breathtaking affair of first-class writing and suspense, and is a fine example of what is sadly missing in many of today's films. The fact that we, as an audience, are drawn into this world by the way in which it takes its time to unravel its many different layers is something that a lot of filmmakers don't consider today.Take, for example, the scenes after the attempted murder on Corleone. The audience are told exactly what is going to happen with Michael's revenge, so that everything will seem plausible when the time comes. Think about it; if we had cut straight to the scene in the restaurant after Michael's announcement that he is going to kill Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) then the fact that Michael finds a gun in the bathroom would seem ridiculous and we would not believe it. It is like this throughout all the film - everything is explained to us, every last piece of information needed to tell us why this thing happens later on in the film, why he dies at this moment. It means that the movie takes its time - the DVD version I have is aprox. 164 minutes long - but in a sense you lose track of time because you are so engrossed in the story.The acting is superb, not just Pacino or Brando, though these two do stand out, but the whole cast, even the extras in Sicily. Again, like every nook of the script, Coppola uses and manipulates every actor's potential to get the performance we deserve as an audience. There's a wonderful scene before the one mentioned earlier where the sons and Tom are discussing what to do next and they're all talking over each other. Utterly believable and excellent.The film is shot beautifully. I'm no expert on this area and I do try to steer clear of it in reviews, but there's no doubt at how gorgeous the whole film looks. The colour is vibrant, and yet the shadows play such an important part in the key scenes. I believe it really reaches its full potential in the scenes in Sicily, truly capturing the beauty of the country, which in turn is transposed to the beauty of Appollina.There are one or two flaws - after all, there has never been and never will be an utterly perfect film, despite what some people say - which are also, ironically, perfectly plausible. The female characters are weak and although this is obviously demonstrating the role of the woman in the Mafian society, Diane Keaton's character could have been stronger. Also, although wonderfully written, the script does need paying attention to, otherwise you are going to find yourself lost in a maze of Italian names.What you cannot argue against, however, is the violence. Yes, ""The Godfather"" is a violent film, but the great thing about this violence is that Coppola only uses it WHEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. Unlike many films today, the violence in this movie is essential to the plot, to keep it driving on and also to give us a fantastic character study of Michael, particularly towards the end of the movie.Enough's being said; if you haven't seen this movie you HAVE to see it, just to see what all the fuss is about. That's what I did, and it turned out all right for me. I mean, I haven't found a horse's head in my bed....yet.9/10"
62,4760,True,0.10070576769770913,"I can't count the times I've seen the Godfather. I can't count the times I've read books about the movie. I can't say how much I regret not having found the time to read Mario Puzo's book. The Godfather is a story about a king and his three sons. And the sons all fight for power one way or another. The succession of the kingdom is the absolute reward for some and the absolute curse for others. There is something utterly seductive about the lighting of the movie, the stories (from the main stories to the secondary characters), about the ongoing feeling that danger lies around the corner, that this life is never safe and that you must, as popular Italian culture suggests, do everything for the family. ""In my youngest and more vulnerable years"" I wrote an essay about the role/position of women in the Godfather. I wrote about the flaws of the Godfather, about how, because it was filmed from the side of the family, you couldn't see the illegitimate character of the Corleone family's work. I wrote about the misogynist approaches and the utterly patriarchal viewpoints of the movie. I wrote about the inherent racism towards other ethnic minorities. But I still can't escape the spell. I still can't believe this feeling when Michael goes to the hospital to see Vito and he protects his father as is in his imaginative nature. There are so many moments in the Godfather that make me shiver. There's so much magic in the trilogy.I don't give this movie a 10, because I am a perfectionist."
63,4761,True,0.17014513930725134,"Mario Puzo's novel about crime, corruption, family and loyalty comes to life with the help of Francis Ford Coppola in The Godfather. The Corleone family, headed by the aging Vito Corleone, is the most powerful family on the East coast, and possibly all of America. They ""own"" senators, judges and policemen. They are above the law. Vito's son, Michael, has just returned from the war a hero, and wants no part in the family business. But when an up and coming rival family wanting to get into the drug trade asks the Corleones for protection, Don Vito declines their offer, sticking to his traditional Sicilian values. The other families aren't as concerned about the old ways and want in, but know that they can't do business without the Corleones' influence. So, they have Don Corleone shot, expecting to gain leverage with the Don out of action. Luckily, the Don survives and Michael, furious with the attempt on his father's life, steps up to take out the opposition.Soon, Michael, originally wanting nothing to do with the family business, proves himself to be quite a strategist, always playing mind games with everyone. Everyone except his father, of course. Michael slowly crawls up the ladder of power, destroying anyone who gets in his way, until he sits comfortably at the top. Ruthlessness is his tool and he wields it well. Only those inside the family and his small circle of long term friends are safe from his wrath.Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone is magnificent. Brando portrays him perfectly as the tough and feared old patriarch that, although brutal to his enemies, loves and cares for his family. His raspy whisper and deliberate movements will forever echo in film history (already having been parodied and imitated countless times).Al Pacino's Michael Corleone makes a very gradual transformation from the respectable war hero with a nice girlfriend to a full-fledged criminal mastermind. At the beginning of the film, Michael is a friendly young man who wants no part in his father's world. In the very last scene, he is a dangerous, cold-blooded sociopath who still cares for his family, but will do anything to further his influence. Pacino gives a career-making performance and fits perfectly into the role of brilliant anti-hero (as well as the roles of Tony Montana in Scarface and Sonny Wortzik in Dog Day Afternoon that would come later in his career).Francis Ford Coppola's directing is perfect. The dark, dramatic lighting used inside the Don's office is a trademark of foreboding danger and power. Everything from the gruesome and, sometimes, disturbing execution killings to the way Vito Corleone looks at his son, Michael, adds to the intoxicating blend of brutality and love that Coppola serves his audience.Nino Rota's score only spices up the brew with his traditional Italian-sounding pieces that conjure up images of tough Sicilian men riding horse-back through rugged terrain in the old country. A beautiful soundtrack to an already beautiful film.The Godfather is about how the human mind is affected by crisis, opportunity and corruption. Michael Corleone does not involve himself in the family business until they go after his father. This proves to be the catalyst. Michael takes the plunge into the underworld and, upon realizing that he is smarter than all of the other families put together, only goes deeper. He plays the game of crime like chess. He plans his moves and has all the angles covered. He strikes swiftly and without mercy. Michael Corleone is a criminal, but he is very different from the goon knocking over a 7-11 with a pen-knife.

You would think a 8 or 9 year kid at the time would find the movie long or boring, but quite the opposite, when it had an intermission at the 2 hour mark we was like wow 2 hours has passed!! This is a movie best not watched on TV where there is commercials to interrupt because TV tends to make one's attention span short due to the enormity of other programming to watch.I remember watching it on TV years later and thinking to myself i can see how someone just seeing it for the first time would find it long and boring. The reason being is because if you do not tune on it from the beginning it is not the type of movie that will catch your attention compared to the action adventure blockbuster movies people are use to seeing. For a movie to keep a couple of 8 or 9 year old kids interested for 4 hours it had to done something right.I am not a movie critic so i don't feel comfortable rating it but to this day it is one of the few movies i can clearly recall almost every scene as compared to other movies where i just have a vague recollection of what they were about and what happened when and where.One reason i think i enjoyed it so much as a kid was because the story was interesting. A mafia kingpin trying to survive gang-wars and treachery.He realizes it is not good profession or lifestyle to have so he tried to steer his son Michael into a peaceful legitimate respectable profession. He tries to explain to Michael the reasons he turned to this lifestyle is because he didn't have access to the educational opportunities Michael had access to. With a wife and many children to feed and jobs very scarce he had to do what was necessary so his family could eat and survive. He knew that Sonny's temperament would not allow Sonny to change course from the family's profession and Fredo so much a nincompoop that Fredo could not have too much responsibility or pressure thrust on him and would need someone to look after him so he kinda was treated like the women of the family. But he saw in Michael intelligence and ability, and he wanted Michael to use his talents legitimately and achieve the American Dream. Sorta what every father wishes for their sons. I think the turning point for Michael from turning from the American Dream was when the police under McCluskey instead of normally taking a neutral role in the war between the gangs took an active role in protecting Sollozo and trying to rid Don Vito of any bodyguards at the Hospital so the allied Sollozo-Barzini-Tattaglia camp could finish Don Vito off. When Michael was roughed up by McCluskey and the police he began to see the American Dream as a big corrupt hypocrisy and that money and the access to money was the only thing that really mattered in America. Recall the speech he gave to Mary Kay when he told her she was the one who was really naive not him ( It may have been in The Godfather part 2).From that point on Michael began see the irony and erroneous assertions of what his dad was saying that politicians and police would desert him if he would began to expand into narcotics but the exact opposite was happening with the opposing Sollozo-Barzini-Tattaglia faction as their Consigliere Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall) predicted. Sollozo was virtually untouchable because he had Police protection because of the wealth he accumulated from his narcotic operations.As a result Michael lost all his idealism and became a pragmatist. Why try to become legitimate and respectable when no one really is and the so called legitimate and respectable people behind closed doors sell out to the highest bidders regardless whether or not if they are ruthless killers, murderers and worst scum of society.You can transform into being respectable and legit once you accumulate your wealth. Notice the talk by Michael near the end that they are moving the operations to Las Vegas and going Legit."
65,4763,True,0.13141724974975066,"Hailed by almost every film critic as a masterpiece this film is regularly voted as #1 in film polls, or at very least in the top 10. And if there was ever a movie which deserved it's place amongst the elite, this is it. Director Francis Ford Coppola had only made low-budget movies and enjoyed limited success as a director up until 1970 when he came to recognition with his screenplay for Patton. The screenplay won himand co-writer Edmund H. North an Oscar. He then began work on a screenplay for The Godfather with Mario Puzo, the book's author. The resulting film took the world by storm and won Coppola his second Oscar for writing. The film also won Best Picture and Best Actor (Marlon Brando) at the 1973 Academy Awards and was nominated for 8 others Oscars including three nominations for Best Supporting Actor (James Caan, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall).The wealth of acting talent in the leading roles is unparalleled. Marlon Brando's Don has been copied and imitated in countless films and TV shows since it's release; the strength and memorable nature of his performance standing as a true testament to his acting ability. Al Pacino gives a career best performance as Michael, struggling to remain aloof of his family's criminal activities and maintain a happy relationship with his girlfriend Kay (played brilliantly by Diane Keaton) but eventually being dragged into the family 'business' by his father's failed assassination attempt. James Caan is superb as the hot-headed older Corleone brother, Sonny; subsequent acting roles have never quite given him the opportunity to shine as he does here. Robert Duvall's cool, calm and collected adopted brother character, Tom, is a marvellous addition to the family as he tries to diffuse situations with sensible advice (he is the family's lawyer and consigliore). However he too appears to have hidden, darker tendencies; the famous horse's head scene is apparently all his own doing. The whole Corleone family is played with perfect depth and emotion by all the actors; John Cazale as Fredo is the perfect example of the understated performancehe is not as prominent as Sonny, Michael and Tom but still an integral player and extremely memorable. The only aspect of the acting which seems to be less than perfect is the supporting actors in the smaller roles. Although there is nothing 'wrong' with their performances, one does feel at times that they are stereotypes i.e. the rotund chef / hit-man Clemenza, and the aging henchman still trying to break out into his own 'family' (Tessio).This is without a doubt the most influential movie of the 1970s and whatever minor quibbles might exist about some of the stereotyping, the acting of the leading stars, the perfect direction and brilliant musical score (by Coppola's father, Carmine) cannot be faulted. The pacing and editing of The Godfather must also be commended because even with a runtime of almost three hours, it never feels boring and withstands repeated viewing. A true American classic, it spawned two sequels; The Godfather Part II, which is also hailed as a masterpiece and won numerous Oscars, and the lesser but still noteworthy Part III. Currently residing at #1 on the IMDb's Top 250 list, this has been firmly lodged there for some time."

It takes us into the backstage of organized crime and shows us it's nature in evident detail. I won't be writing about the plot since it's pretty clear to everyone. I'll just write a few lines on the parts of the film I found excellent and very memorable.One of the best little details was the piano tune which kept playing at every tense moment. If you watch the movie for the first time it can fill you up with quite a lot of anxiety (second or third viewing still can't exclude it). The final act was exceedingly memorable and symbolic. We see Michael Corleone and his family at the church during a sacred act, the christening of his niece. Parallel to that event is the killing of the family rivals. This act gives a statement that there is nothing sacred in the world of organized crime. Every promise is broken for the benefit of the family business.It's very hard to find an objective flaw in this film. I'll just have to say ""it's not business, it's strictly personal"" :)So let it be: The very FIRST movie ever to officially receive a 10/10 from me. .......... +5/5 .........."

The ageing don corleonie played eloquently by the late Marlon Brando refuses to enter into the narcotics trade following the end of ww2, following don Vito refusal this starts off a gang war between the 5 families of new york with the corleonies. The antagonist the barzini family and the tattalia family attemp to have don Vito character killed effectively castrating the corleones power. The attempt fails and Sonnie the dons eldest son takes control of the family while don Vito recovers meanwhile the dons youngest son Michael played by AL pacino agrees to kill the tattalia top narcotics distributor in a carefully orchestrated subterfuge at a peace negotiation. The death of the narcotic distributor escalates the war further leading to sonnies bloody execution at a toll booth one of the movies memorable scenes. Young Michael while in exile in Italy learns of his brothers misfortune and takes over following his fathers retirement, he vows revenge for his brothers murder. I will not give to much of the plot away but it is intriguing to see all the scheming and plotting by the mobsters. Both the camera work and lighting are superb and give a real atmospheric feel to the picture. This film is a must see for all film fans, rent it buy it now."
68,4766,True,0.04850868678924516,"Fantastic movie. Incredibly rich storyline, repeat viewings reveal extra details that are echoed in the rest of the trilogy. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino usually receive all the plaudits but their fellow stars; James Caan, John Cazale and Robert Duval also shine. It's also a fascinating movie in way of transformations. Al Pacino starts out as a 'nice college boy' who refuses to become embroiled in the family business, only to become ensnared when an attempt is made on his father's life. Pacino's change in character is carried off with credibility, both physically and verbally. I have seen the trilogy numerous times but I still want to see more! Well done Mr Coppola!"

The directing is wonderful, not to mention the acting is brilliant, cinematography perfect, and everything else about it. I personally believe that any writer/actor starting out in their careers should take the time to view the godfather and experience what a real movie is. The film itself is told in the most perfect way it could be showed. HANDS DOWN. The godfather is not in MY top 10 list of all time favorite movies, but I easily predict it to be in the top 5 best movies of all time in any poll put in front of me. 1. Citizen Cane, 2.

70,4768,True,0.12809090870834383,"To begin with, I had not seen the Godfather, nor its subsequent sequels, until about two years ago. I have only one thing to say about this: Why? Why did I not see this sooner? Francis Ford Coppolla creates a brilliantly haunting masterpiece, full of drama, and perfectly sets the mood, entrancing you frame by frame into the world of legalized crime. Marlon Brando shines in quite possibly his greatest performance ever as the Don Vito Corleone. While he may not appear to be a truly menacing figure, as the viewer you instantly respect him with the way he carries himself and his words. Brando's range of emotions, the way every line he speaks is with conviction of a man who is so wise, truly defines the character that I'm not sure anyone originally thought could be so strong. The next main cast standout is Al Pacino, who gives here a staggering performance as Vito's youngest son, Michael. The transformation of his character is absolutely incredible, from the mild-mannered Captain in the United States Marine Corps, to the future and eventual Godfather of the Corleone Family. Pacino completely grasps his role and takes on an entirely different life himself, to the point where we forget he is an actor. The rest of the cast is extremely superb, all the way down to the most minute character. Perhaps the two most touching scenes are 1) When Michael visit's his father in the hospital after the attempted murder at the hands of the Tattaglia family, and 2) After James Caan's character, Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone, is albeit brutally shot numerous times, and Vito Corleone asks the mortuary to ""use all of his powers"" to fix his son, because he ""didn't want his mother to see him like this."" This is truly a magnificent story, filled with betrayal, family loyalty, and eventual heartbreak. A marvelous masterpiece from both Copolla and Mario Puzo, who wrote the screenplay (and the later who wrote the novel). And to think that Paramount almost fired both Copolla and Pacino because they weren't the first choices! That would have been an insult! If that had happened, I would not be here, commenting on this movie, because it would not have been anywhere near as beautiful of a film. If you haven't seen this yet, see it now! Don't wait another minute! If you have, watch it again. And again. And again. Now, I'm going to end this review, and watch it myself."
71,4769,True,0.005095763686614897,I am young so I still have lots of classics movies to discover. I've heard lots about The Godfather but here in my beautiful hometown DVD's can even get more expensive than somewhere else or in the US. So I've asked a friend who has the treelogy and I've eventually watched it and I've liked it very much. There is the violent bit but the movie also speak from heart to the hearts. The horse-head scene was scary and so were the scene with Sonny being shot with a crowd of bullet. Nevertheless there was this beautiful scene with heartwarming moments and history of Italian emigration to the Americas. I am looking very forward to seeing Godfather 2 and 3. If they are half as good I will write about them because beautiful movie need to be appreciated. Thank you for reading.

It has romance, drama, action, and a little comedy. Every scene is memorable in some small way. Amerigo Bonasera and Johnny Fontane both come to the Don with problems that they have. The Don tells both of these men that he will help them out Luca Brasi also gives his thanks to the Don for inviting him to the wedding and he hopes that Connie's first child will be a masculine one. Michael and Kay arrive shortly after the wedding of Carlo Rizzi and Connie Corleone begins. Michael explains to Kay that he doesn't want to be in part with his family business. He also tells her the story of how Johnny Fontane got into a big band but, wanted out of the contract. He couldn't get out so the Don and Luca Brasi went over to the band leader and said that either his brains or his signature would be on the check. After the wedding scene Tom Hagen heads over to Hollywood to talk to the big shot producer, Jack Woltz, about Johnny Fontane being in the new war film. Jack Woltz goes on to explain that he cannot let Johnny be in it because he would be perfect for the part and he made Jack look like a fool. Tom Hagen flies back to New York and then the next night we see the famous horse head in the bed of Jack Woltz. With that Johnny Fontante gets the part for the film. Next Virgi Solozzo comes to the Don saying that he has a proposition; he would need funding and then he would smuggle in drugs. They would then split the money from the profits. The Don explains that the narcotics business is a risky on and he doesn't want to be a part of it. Solozzo doesn't like this and has the Don shot while he exits his office one day. The Don doesn't die but gets seriously injured. Michael and the rest of the family meet up at the house and try to find out who the person inside their family betrayed them. They finally come to the conclusion that Tessio had betrayed them and kill him. Meanwhile Michael heads in to the city to eat dinner with Kay, he then leaves and heads over to the hospital to meet his father. With no one their except for the nurse and the Don, Michael quickly rushes him to another room and stands guard outside of the hospital. Solozzo's men come by in a car but soon realize that someones guarding Vito Corleone so they drive off. Captain Mckulskey doesn't like this so he comes over and slaps Michael on the face. The Corleone family quickly sends over bodyguards to help protect the Don. Later the Corleone family finds out that Luca Brasi has been killed. He was going on a special errand for the Don. He heads over to Solozzo and Tattalgia saying that he is displeased with the Corleone family and wants to go into a new job. The men are not convinced and kill him. Santino, Peter Clemenza, Tom Hagen, and Michael Corleone all figure out how to make the most of the meeting that Solozzo has just called with Michael. They decide that the best choice would be to have Michael gun down Solozzo and Mckluskey. The Corleone's get the location of the restaurant that Michael and Solozzo will meet and plant a gun in one of the bathroom stalls. When they arrive Michael is searched, he then asks permission to goto the bathroom, comes back out with the gun and kills Mckluskey and Solozzo. He then exits and drives away. The newspapers soon flood with headlines of the killing of a Police Captain. Michael has to be deported to Sicily because it's to dangerous for him in America. He meets a woman named Apollonia and marries her. Later one of his bodyguards, Fabrizzio, kills his wife. Michael becomes infuriated but cannot do anything about it. After he is patched back up he gets sent back to America because its safe again for him. Meanwhile in the time Michael stayed at Sicily, the Don had returned home, and Carlo was beating up Connie. Sonny gets really mad and rushes over to try and help Connie. While going to her house, he gets shot by what it seems like hundreds of bullets. The Don is in pain and soon calls a meeting with all of the major families in the United States to call peace between them. When Michael returns home he talks to Kay and they get married. Soon Michael becomes the new Don of the family and heads over to Las Vegas to check out on Freddie, his brother. He also talks to Moe Greene and says that he wants to buy out the casino. After Moe Greene refuses to sell, Michael heads back to New York. We then see a very sad scene where the Don is playing with Michael's child and suddenly gets a heart attack in the garden and dies. The funeral for the Don had a big turnout with many members of other families coming to pay their respects. After that Carlo Rizzi, and Connie Corleone ask Michael if he can become the Godfather of there newborn child. Michael accepts the offer. The next scene is probably the most beautiful in cinematic history. Michael Corleone is having Connie, and Carlo's child baptized while he is also having his capo-regimes, and bodyguards executing the members of other families that have become a threat to him. The movie finally ends with Michael killing Connie's husband, Carlo Rizzi."
73,4771,True,0.06289983428814118,"M.HollenbeckThe Godfather This is a spoiler 	The Godfather is a classic. There are so many spoofs and other movies that adapt or down right steal a scene or a quote from the Godfather. Watching this movie helps to explain a lot about so many others. The plot was intriguing, every event through the plot into a new turn. Like just when a person would think Vito has died and then he recovers against all odds. This movie is just like that. And Mike goes and guns down the cop and then flees to Italy. Nobody that hadn't seen the movie before would expect Mike to go and get married. Then at the most unlikely moment Sonny dies as he is going to help his sister and is gunned down at the causeway. And at the beginning when they chop off that horse's head as part of that `deal he can't refuse'.
	Mike had not really get involved in his father's work up until that night after Vito had been gunned down. When he and the baker stood out front of the hospital to protect his father from being `finished off'. After that it was almost all down hill from there. He then killed the police chief and that mobster. After Sonny was killed and Vito recovered mike became the decision-maker in the family. Until Vito finally died, at that point (at the end of the movie) he became the head of the family. 	In a way the movie revolved around him and things that effected him, Events that pointed him in a certain direction. That is probably what makes this the excellent movie that it is. That is why it receives a ratting of ten out of ten."
74,4772,True,0.1049392876596153,"**** out of four fear the few spoilersFrancis Ford Coppola's classic gangster drama is the perfect film. A combination od drama, violence, even family responsibilities. It goes deep inside the Corleone family business, and shows that even gangsters have families they have to worry about.Marlon Brando gives one of the greatest screen performances ever, as The Don Vito Corleone. True, he spends most of the movie bound to a bed, but he is definately the main character of this epic. After a failed assassination attempt on Vito's life, its up to his sons, Michael(Al Pacino), a nice college boy who never got in the family business, and Sonny(James Caan) the hot head older son who cant wait to be in charge.Michael puts his legit life behind, in order to save his father, and kills two men in the process.
Brando won his second oscar for this one, but didnt except it. Either way, The Don is one of the greatest, and most recognizable characters in cinematic history. Caan was robbed of his supporting actor oscar, cause he is the life of the movie, playing Sonny. Robert Duvall snagged a nod for being Tom. The cool conselerie who wants everybody to stay cool. Pacino in his first big role amazes as the son forced to turn to a life of crime.Great performances by Sterling Hayden and John Marley add to this amazing film. Hayden as a crooked cop, and Marley as a perverted movie producer, with a love of horses, and really young girls.Made in 1972, there wasnt a film before, or after that was like The Godfather. The original gangster flick, before Scarface, Goofellas, or Donnie Brasco. The Godfather is a classic, and a movie beyond all bouderies. It changed the history of movies forever, and it still does.THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER!!!"
75,4773,True,0.12148891899697421,"Godfather and PART II are examples of elite filmmaking. Anyone seeing them for the first time should introduce themselves to the theatrical versions (Part III is good - the Vatican sequences are brilliant - but it's just not in the same league; many scenes were just recaps of what we saw [better] in I & II) ( PART II also recaps some scenes from the original, but they were presented on the ""flipside"" - and it worked).Now a very positive gripe: ""The Godfather: A Novel for Television"" was first broadcast in 1977, it has recently resurfaced on some cable channels (covers I & II in chronological order and retitled The Godfather Saga). What's frustrating is that now, no matter what version I see, I can't help feeling I'm watching an abridged film. For 99.9% of all films, who would care; but this is storytelling at its finest. PART II was innovative for its prequel/sequel presentation that shows (SUBTLE SPOILERS) the irony of the rise and fall of a powerful crime dynasty. But now (I know I'm not alone) after seeing the outakes inserted where they should be, this has made the viewing so much more enriching, especially if you've read Mario Puzo's novel. The problem is that not only is the saga censored (reasonable enough for TV fare), but they've trimmed some lines of dialogue from the theatrical version (I'm not talking about lines containing profanity) apparently for time constraint. What makes the theatrical version more difficult to enjoy now is that the outakes are better pieces of filmaking than 90% of the movies out there (I knew this gripe would turn into a compliment). And in putting it in chronological order, the irony is lessened, but in no way is it lost. The viewer is allowed to see an American tragedy unfold.I did tape a local broadcast of the ""saga"" in 1988 and again on AMC recently and both versions of THOSE have little scenes that the other doesn't have. EXAMPLE: At the end of Godfather, the scene fades to black (1955), then fades up to show Michael Corleone (now in 1958) walking along his Nevada lakeside estate in the wee hours of the morning of his son's communion/celebration. It's a well done transition scene that's in the 88' telecast, but not in the recent ones (from a fade to black, it almost jump cuts to the party and Fredo's entrance with wife Deanna). Even the bonus disc of the DVD that contains deleted scenes (separate from the films) don't contain all of them. Just one example is (from Godfather I), the first scene that introduces Don Corleone, after the undertaker Bonasera exits the Don's study, Sonny is sternly chastised by the Don for not paying attention (that was worth seeing just to hear Marlon Brando whistle). It's duration is only about 10 seconds long, but it cements the fact that Sonny is the intended Don in training who still needs tweaking by his father.This is damn fine filmmaking that captures the texture and atmosphere of the time told in the story; be it early 1900's, mid 40's thru the late 50's and Coppola successfully borrowed from the styles of moviemaking, styles lifted from the 20's, 40's and 50's. Movies over 50 years ago didn't have fancy subjective camera moves and Coppola's decision to film using old fashion techniques makes you feel you're watching a film from that time era (I realize this was early 70's, but new wave style and zip zooms had been around for 10 years[?] ).I'm confident that hundreds of thousands (millions ?) of movie lovers would immerse themselves in a longer UNCUT version that is no longer constrained by theatrical time factors. 7 hours and 15 minutes (not including end credits and no Part III) would be impossible in a theater, but this is the age of home entertainment (still can't beat watching a movie in the theater) that allows freedom AND a stop button (2 or 3 well placed intermissions would be better). That means you're saddled with more footage of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, Robert Duvall, James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire...ect giving us some of the finest performances in their careers. Any complaints about that?? Special mention to all but especially James Caan who lost so much footage to the cutting room floor. During the 2nd act of the Godfather, James Caan and Al Pacino are the stars of the movie as the story flips back and forth between the two; after all Sonny is the heir apparent. To show how instrumental he was to the family by exposing his leadership ability and softer side made what follows that much more shocking.No, I didn't buy the DVD (I did rent the bonus disc) for these reasons. I'll wait till they reconstruct the saga on a new DVD edition(if rumors are true) but please...no Part III.(Subtle Spoiler) Note: Never was comfortable when Godfather PART II changed Vito's birthday from April 28,1887 (The Godfather -cemetery monument) to 1892 (from the opening ""In 1901 the godfather was born Vito...he was nine years old!) Marlon Brando's closing scenes led you to believe the 1887 birthdate.Francis Coppola is an artistic genius, he's never made up his mind to stop tinkering with editing the saga. Even the Godfather Epic 1902-1959 contained only some deleted scene and excised 2 or 3 scenes from the theatrical version. I'm looking forward to THE version where all the scenes are left intact.The Godfather   10 out of 10 The Godfather PART II   10 out of 10 The Godfather Saga (uncensored)  a  10+"

Everytime I watch it I fall in love with it more and more.  The movie is just perfect!! I have never seen Al Pacino play a part like he did in that movie.  Not only is he cute but he had his part down-packed.  I enjoyed the way that the brothers protected their baby sister Connie.  That stupid husband of hers beat up on her while she was pregnant.  I wanted to beat the crap out of him.  But Sonny did it for me. Unfortunately, the jerk retaliatated against Sonny. I found that part of the movie very sad.And definitely hats off to Marlon Brando.  I found myself sympathizing with him during the movie.  He knew when to quit, unfortunately Michael didn't.

77,4775,True,0.09255032603042701,"Warning(slight spoilers ahead)What is perfection? Perfection is, according to my dictionary, perfect condition, faultless quality, highest excellence. These phrases perfectly describe ""The Godfather"". There is truly no greater movie. There is no superfluous scene, plot twist, nothing. Marlon Brando, with the exception of Robert De Niro, is the greatest film actor of all time, and he more than proves why. It's funny how no studio executives wanted him because in the '60s he made some bad movies and killed ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" the way Michael Cimino killed ""Heaven's Gate""....but he was in top form in this film. His character, Vito Corleone, was one who was deeply committed to his family, that was of paramount concern. Sure, the film romanticizes violence, and that in reality is a bad thing, but you just cannot help but love it. Coppola is a genius, and this film more than proves why. Al Pacino is one of the greatest actors ever, and his transformation from naive, innocent young Michael Corleone to ruthless, cold-blooded killer is so subtle you have to watch the film again to see exactly how he did it. The theme song, of course, is unbelievably melodious, Nino Rota is another genius, everything associated with this movie is nothing but genius. God bless Mario Puzo, who passed away a few years ago, for writing the novel. This movie has so many famous quotes it's unbelievable. It's ironic given the serious tone of the film, that I laughed my *** off(don't exactly know what your rules are on the ""posterior"" word) when Clemenza instructed the guy to ""leave the gun"" and ""take the cannolis"". Diane Keaton is very pretty, and an excellent Kay. My only gripe with the film is that Robert De Niro was not in it. Yes, he was in the sequel, and won an Oscar for his performance, but this is in a way superior to Part II and I wished he was a part of this one. I also smiled when Brando smiled when he knew that Michael was going to protect him when he was in the hospital, family. The bond between family that should not be broken. Oscars for best picture, Coppola and Puzo's screenplay and actor Brando(in arguably the greatest acting performance in cinematic history)(rivaling De Niro in ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Raging Bull"", himself in ""On the Waterfront"", Anthony Hopkins in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and Jack Nicholson in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", Meryl Streep in ""Sophie's Choice"") On AFI's 100 Greatest Movies at #3(should be #1).

Granted there are some genuinely funny moments in The Godfather (""Leave the gun, take the cannoli"" ""We don't talk business at the table.""), but there were some laughs at what would be considered some very inappropriate places.For instance, the infamous horsehead in the bed got some chuckles.  When the scene of the house fades to Don Corleone, it gets an outright belly laugh. I really don't remember this as being funny.  Also, the scene in Sicily where Michael's bodyguard leaves so skittishly, forecasting some bad things happening to Michael's car... outright laughter.The American viewing audience has changed since 1972.  I don't believe that these scenes were intended to illicit laughter, and I would guess they did not when the film was released.  If any one could tell me what viewer reaction to those scenes in theaters when the films were released were, I'd be very interested."
80,4778,True,0.052874629305759556,"All I can say is that this is the best movie of all time.  it has a great plot, excellent acting, great costume and set design, outstanding direction, and a very beautiful soundtrack.  The Godfather has many famous scenes such as the restaurant scene when Michael(Al Pacino) kills Solozzo(Al Lettieri) and McCluskey(Sterling Hayden), and when the movie pezzonovante wakes up with the severed head of his prized horse in his bed.  There's the brutal killing of Sonny, the gunning of Don Vito(Marlon Brando) across from his office, the car bombing of Apollonia, and the opening scene with Amerigo Bonasera(Salvatore Corsitto) telling the Don about how his daughter was beaten brutally.Though the most incredible scene is the Baptism Sequence.  Word's cannot describe it.  The way the organ goes from a mellow to haunting and how it goes back and forth between the church and the assassins preparing to kill the heads of the other New York families and the actual killing of the Dons. This is Francis Ford Coppola at his best.10/10"
81,4779,True,0.13808898109506448,"I am glad to see that it is still #1 on the IMBb.  I just watched ""The Godfather Saga: A Novel for Television"" on American Movie Classics.  It was great except it had to be edited for telivision.  I have just looked up that that theres a ""Godfather Trilogy 1901-1980"" which features ALL THREE films re-edited.  I shall sure want to see that some time.  If you have seen all three films you should surely try to catch the program I just saw on a movie or even network channel and see a very good deal of cut scenes, or better yet you should see the one I just looked up which I have not seen, but surely will.
The first time, unfortunately, I saw this film was not a very good experience.  I got tired and fell asleep during the half-hour or so. Except I didn't sleep, I struggled to stay awake which is just aggravating.  This, of course, is not the film's fault.  It had been a normal hectic day.  I tried to watch the entire film again the next day, but I found I couldn't get it all in because I had priorities the next day, so I just watched some of the stuff I had struggled with.  I still hadn't gotten any emotion of opinion, really of the film, except for the good directing.
Finally, probably over two months later, I rented it from my local library along with the second one.  I watched the whole thing straight through and neadless to say, I was amased.  From the great opening scene where Abandando tells of the justice he wants for revenge of what has happened to his daughter to the Sicilian wedding, I was witnessing film greatness.  At the beginning of the film, you know that this is a powerful empire and that the ruler is wiser then ever.  You get glimpses pf the inside aggresiveness. When Sonny goes and finds that the FBI is monitering he he spits down and wrcks apart one of their cameras.  Then out the shake of keeping it together, throws money for the camera at the ground.  What goes on in that office while the wedding preseeds is some of the best diologue put on film. Any two year old who has watched movies or telivision woulld know ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" several years before the film is witnessed.
With Jack Waltz, a brutal Sicilian way is performed when he finds the gift of his six-hundred thousand dollar horses head in his bed.  Then there's the rejection of Sollozo's narcotics when Luca Brasi is stabbed throught the hand and strangled.  Later a Sicilian message is given of his bullet proof vest with two fishes in it.
It is obvious that Michael Corleone is having a splendind life.  He's a World War Two hero and he has a girl.  So, it could very well be wondered why did he decide to be the one to do the hits with the upmost volunatry. Because of his compassion for his family who ha had wanted no part of as far as business.  Indeed the job is done nervously, but thoroughly even with only one bullet for Solozzo and waiting a few seconds instead of dong so right when he cam eout like he was instructed to.  When The Don here's news of his beloved son's job, he is disturbed for he truly didn't want him in the business despite ""plans"" he may ahve had for him.
In Sicily, Michael finds new romance with Appolonia.  He marries her and soon finds himself in danger.  Appolonia is killed by a car bomb planted from Michaels own trusted Fabrisio (A reason wht you should see one of those sagas).  In America, Don Corleone's daughter connie is in jeapordy with her husband.  This jeapordy is the link the enemies use to trigger Sonny.  In one of the most absolutely brilliant scenes ever, he goes to the tollbooth. He notices that the car infront of him is clutching.  As the tendant reaches over to give him his change, he drops it and reaches down as the window shuts.  A line of hitmen with Thompsons then appear in a booth and two others come out of the clutching car.  They burst fire into the car and Sonny is swarmed with bullets.  He makes his way out of the car where he is swambed more.  He lets out a yell.  The firing stops for second.  Then the firing continues untill they fianally stop and one of the men kicks him in the head and they go off leaving the dead Sonny with bunches and bunches and bunches of bullets in him.  It is a fabolously directed scene.  Then there's the aftermath of Vito's ""Look how they massacred my boy.""  This with the favor being returned from the opening scene where the favor is actually sorrowfully doing the best he can to make Sonny look better.
When Michael returns from Sicily, he takes over as don.  After awhile he goes to Kay and marries her telling her ""His way of things is done.  Even he knows that.  In five years the corlenone family will be completely legitamate.""  In Las Vegas, Fredo has a job for the big-shot Mow Green. When Michael wants to buy his hotel out, Moe refuses with insult and threat. Wehn Fredo critisises his brother for his conduct, Michael responds with ""Fredo you're my brother and I love you, but don't ever take side with anyone against the family again.  Ever.""  This lives out.  Before Vito dies, he tells Michael that the one who comes with the meeting is the traitor. He also expresses his regret for his son's position.  ""I never wanted this for you.""  ""You could have been Senator Corleone.  Governor Corleone. Something.""  The Don dies playing with his grandson.
At the funeral, who should be the informastion deliverer for the meeting, but Sal Tessio.  While Michael stands as godfather for Connie and Carlo's baby, he orders the hits of the five families.  The sequence has very elegant cuts of preparation and preseeding while interceeding with the holy ceromony.  Clamenza does his work at an elevator, firing two shots with a rifle while others take scare of their prey by locing in a revolving door, busting in and spraying the bed with Thompsons, coming ans shooting in an eye through glasses, and shooting at the bottom of exterior stairs of a building.  When the ceromony is over, Michael goes to Carlo's house and snags for a confesion for Sonny while assuring that his life will be spared. He then goes into a car where Clamenza is in a the backseat with a ""Hello Carlo.""  He then stragles him with him struggling, moving his legs up, breaking through the winsheild as the cars goes forth.  It's as well as everything else in the film, very greatly directed as the shoe gets to the camera.  Then Connie rushes in with her terror and recenment for Michael's action.  When Connie is taken away Kay asks about wether it's true.  After a few entences Michael breaks through with ""ENOUGH!""  Then he calms and says. ""All right.  This one time you can ask me about my affairs.""  When she quietly asks ""Is it true?""  Michael casually responds softly ""No.""  Then there's the great close of Michael being kissed as royalty and Kay watching with the door shuting in front of her, closing her out.
This film is fabulous and worthy of it's praise.  It's one ofthe few films that is very popolar, but very few people critisize it despite anything. Story, acting, directing, cinemotatography, art/set direction, everything. I have not seen Cavalada, but I am most petrifide that Francis Ford Coppola didn't get the oscar for best dierector.  This is an incredible classic about crime and life that must be seen.  It will always remain, as long as film, a fabulous film."
82,4780,True,0.08421492846972957,"MARIO PUZO'S THE GODFATHER (that is the full name of the film) is haunting, gothic, thought-provoking and an excellent sociological study. On the surface, this is a story about organized crime, loyalty, and family. On the subsurface, Coppola weaves brilliant themes about parallel identities and the profound influence of example. In essence, THE GODFATHER isn't a gangster film; it is too intricate and genuine of a film to be characterized as simply a `gangster film'. Much of the importance of the movie lies in the actual character of the Godfather. Marlon Brando's Godfather seems to represent an individual who is world-weary, but yet, not disillusioned to the point of extending loyalty to others. We look at THE GODFATHER from the standpoint of an individual on the outside looking in. Even though the opening scenes take place in the midst of a wedding, this is a closed society to us. Criminals and cold-blooded killers dance, sing, and play with all the innocence of children. And yet, we want to be close to many of these people once the movie ends. When an undertaker named Amerigo Bonasera asks the Godfather to perform a service for him the patriarch reminds him of the fact that Bonasera never ""wanted his friendship"" and that he couldn't remember the last time he was invited over for a ""cup of coffee"". We may relate to the many times that we, like Don Corleone, extended our friendship and loyalty to others but never got it in return. I know too many people that are more concerned with having someone else do something for them than returning any sort of favor. It's amazing that as powerful of a figure the Godfather is, he also looks at the small acts that characterize friendship. I began to relate to him so much I began to wish that all fathers could retain many of the beautiful characteristics that this man possesses. This is not to deify the character lead of Coppola's film. After all, the Godfather is a criminal. And yet, when he dies in the film, it's as if the World has suffered a great loss. I actually cried during this scene the first time I saw it when I was a kid. It is interesting to note that we are not supposed to respect the criminal organization in this film. After all, the extent to which a person is protected in the Don's extended criminal family is often related to the extent to which a character is willing to shed blood. A good member must be willing to break the law and deny one's friends but never their family. In essence, the movie is filled with paradoxes (not in plot, but in the characters themselves). We see a grandfatherly figure that pulls the strings of a criminal organization. We witness the transformation of the good son to the calculating killer. We see benevolence in many of the supporting characters that are willing to kill. THE GODFATHER is a movie that is more complicated and intricate than people are willing to admit. As a result, at our access is one of the most fascinating character studies."

Speaking of how horrible this movie was, Al Pacino is probably the worst actor I've ever seen. Everyone talks about how great he was in Scarface. I mean I have to give him credit, he did go on to become a superstar with great films such as: Any Given Sunday, The Merchant of Venice, (and let's not forget) The Recruit. Talk about an amazing movie, add Colin Farrell and Al Pacino together and you'll get something Jesus couldn't even come up with. I mean seriously, how many times did they shoot Don Corleone and he was still alive? I just don't buy that. As an aspiring actor, If I would have read the script for The Godfather (part one, two, or three) I would have laughed and wiped my browneye with it. Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola for making a horrible movie. I recommend this movie to no one. If you are one of the millions who support this movie, I hope you burn for eternity.

The suspense builds when the Corleone family clashes with their rivals, resulting in exile, murder and revenge. In addition, Nino Rota's mysterious music score compliments the film well.A lot of characters appear in the movie, but Marlon Brando and Al Pacino were the best in my opinion, delivering their iconic gangster roles with much precision and brilliance.Back to the plot, it does go at a very steady pace and sometimes it does tend to drag the movie to the point of borderline boredom.

I heard many critics saying that The Part Three ruined the Trilogy but i don't agree, i liked it very much. I would give it 9.5 and 10 for the first two. The direction,picture, story, cast, acting all are perfect and that's why this film deserves the maximum grade. For all those who have not yet seen it, i strongly recommend to see it as soon as possible!"

130,5609,False,0.1806530697765874,"Having only been born 14 years after the release of The Godfather, I don't know if audiences at the time realised just how influential the film would become in later years. It has been homaged, parodied and copied so much - Don Corleone's husky voice and prominent chin especially - that it's a miracle it's managed to hold onto its status as one of the finest pictures Hollywood has ever produced. It's also rather astonishing that the film was ever made at all, given the troubled production amidst a meddling Paramount (who pretty much held a gun to director Francis Ford Coppola's head throughout). But watching it again, 41 years after it was made, it's just as beautiful and thrilling as it was when I first saw it.Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the Sicilian head of the Corleone crime family. His eldest son Sonny (James Caan) is his short-tempered and hot-headed heir, the polar opposite to the youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who is college-educated and has just returned from serving in World War II. When the Don refuses an offer to invest in the booming drugs trade by drug baron Virgil 'The Turk' Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) - who is backed by Corleone rivals the Tattaglia's - he is gunned down and almost killed. With his father in hospital and still in danger, Michael finds himself slowly being drawn into the family business he vowed to stay away from.Head of Paramount at the time Bob Evans said he wanted to ""smell the spaghetti"" and hired the relatively inexperienced Coppola, who is of Sicilian heritage, to direct the film, in order to give the film authenticity. From the opening scene, it is evident that the gamble paid off. The wedding of the Don's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), is a textbook guide on how to introduce characters to an audience. This long, gorgeous segment of the film establishes the Corleone's sense of family importance. They are all cold-blooded killers, perhaps, but they are loyal and have a code. It's also fascinating to see the hierarchy within organised crime, something that seems embedded into our conscience now after countless films involving 'made' men and capo's.But it's a combination of many elements that makes The Godfather so great. The patient, controlled approach, Coppola and novel author Mario Puzo's celebrated, Oscar-winning screenplay, Nino Rota's powerful score, the subtle dark comedy (""leave the gun, take the cannoli"") the magnificent set-pieces (Michael searching for the gun in the cafe restroom is still nerve-jangling) , and perhaps most of all, the acting talent on display. Brando, Pacino and Robert Duvall (as adopted son and consigliere Tom Hagen) can boast career-defining performances from the picture, and can celebrate film careers spanning decades and countless awards. There's little I can say about The Godfather that hasn't already been said, but this is one of the true undisputed classics of American cinema.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
131,5610,False,0.11431404214862358,"Movies are made for a lot of reasons and can inflict human emotions to the audience. Some tend to be classics because a lot of people enjoyed the movie and raved about it. Others don't go far to be known. In my opinion, movies that are classics are going to stay for a long time. Movies that don't fare well will be forgotten. But, what about movies like The Godfather? Is that movie is going to be around for a long time? Absolutely. Is it for all generations to see? Absolutely. Without a doubt, The Godfather is the leader to all of the great movies. The movie is adapted from Mario Puzo's best-seller and it tells the story of a family. Vito Corleone is the head of his family. He is also the head of the family's business. His family deals with different situations that are dealt with in their own style and fashion. In other words, they are the Mafia. When Vito's son comes home from the war, he decides on his own behalf to not get involved in his family's business. Michael Corleone, Vito's son, decides to live his own life while his family deals with their own problems. But, when one of Vito's sons, Sonny, played by James Caan, is killed during a mob hit, Vito decides to take revenge against the people who killed his son. Meanwhile, Michael becomes aware of his surroundings and starts to see a downfall of his father's empire. His father is severely injured in the streets after being gunned down and Michael starts to wonder who's going to watch over the family. In other words, who's going to be the next godfather? As the movie progresses, I was suddenly starting to see a change being done to the movie and also to the movie industry. This rise and fall story is told very beautifully and is directed with a focused look at a world where family sticks together and carry out their jobs and fall down and suffer the consequences. This movie has a lot in store and has a lot of feeling about the underworld of the mafia. We even see that even though Michael does become who he is in the end, we know that for a fact that the choice was one that couldn't be refused. The Godfather is a film to be hailed. It's portrayal of the Italian mob is not stereotypical. Instead, the movie focuses on a family that is doused with honor, pride, lust and life. People do get hurt in these drastic situations and those wounds do hurt in a way that you've never felt before. For me, this film speaks louder than the words that are being said. It is more than a gangster movie. It is what the movies are meant to do, which is entertain us at its best and greatest. The performances by Marlon Brando is excellent. He really leads a very well-casted movie that include Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone, Robert Duvall, as the family lawyer, who is Irish and the supporting role of Diana Keaton as Pacino's love interest. All of the acting in The Godfather is phenomenal. This is the movie that made Al Pacino a star. He is that great of a legendary actor to star as Michael. Director Francis Ford Coppola said that in several interviews involving his film, he said that The Godfather was the hardest film to make. With a ballooning budget and a casting problem with the role of Vito Corleone, Coppola suffered most of the time and even was afraid he'll lose his job. In my opinion, he should be proud of the film he made. Even though it was troubling to make, in the end, it paid off. Not only being in the top 10 grossing films of 1972, but also allowing us to see a movie that's worth watching and worth looking at. It is also fill with style and power that in the end, we are starving to see it again. The Godfather took home 3 Oscars, including Best Picture and spawned 2 sequels. As a movie buff, all I can say is that The Godfather leads behind other classic movies like Citizen Kane, Lawrence of Arabia and Casablanca. Like those 3 other movies, it's the power and story-telling that grabs us out of the movie theater and puts us into the spotlight with well-scripted characters and various stories that emerged out of the family. The sheer critical praise of The Godfather continues to seen and even though it's been 41 years since the film's release, this film isn't going to die. The epic scope and vision of this underworld is going to live on and keep this classic pumping. The Godfather is the best film of 1972 and yet, one of the greatest movies of all time. ★★★★ 4 stars."
132,5611,False,0.1712292622439648,"The Godfather is easily the shining star in the crime genre and 'epic' films in general. It is seen as one of the greatest films of all time and it's pretty simple to see why. Everything about it is magnificent, the story is one of cinemas finest, the characters are dynamic and well developed, the music is timeless and it captures post-war America/organised crime era like no other. The story follows the Corleone crime family, the aging head Don Vito wishes to move his family into modern times which corresponds with his youngest son Michael returning from the war and his daughter's wedding. The Don is approached to do a deal with drug dealer Sollozzo, but turns him down which leads to his own fatal shooting. This leads to the aggressive Sonny talking control and Michael, who was set to lead a normal life, being dragged into a mob war that changes the family like no-one could have imagined. The story is brilliant, it's never straightforward and will always keep you guessing as what will happen to the characters. It takes you on a journey, starting at one place and ending a million miles away, but making sure that everything flows and makes sense.Every single cast member nails their role, which is some achievement given the massive amount of characters. Marlon Brando gives one of cinemas greatest characters as the aging Don, everything from the way he speaks to the way he moves is perfectly done. Al Pacino got his breakthrough and he commands the screen. The way he manages to show the subtle changes in the seemingly calm Michael are excellent, he becomes more twisted and less humane as the film goes on. After all it is mainly based on the changes he goes through. James Caan is also brilliant as the hot-headed Sonny, his great screen presence works wonders in showing a man who can't control is anger. Robert Duvall deserves equal praise as the reserved and smart Tom Hagen, a nice alternative to the others. Everyone else is great, from Richard Castellano and Abe Vigoda as Vito right hand men to John Cazale as the frail Fredo to Al Lettieri as the menacing Sollozzo to Diane Keaton as the gentle Kay. The look of the film is fantastic, the cinematography is dark and dimly coloured which helps to reflect the era perfectly. The music is equally fabulous. The main theme is one of the most recognisable of all time and the music does carry an authentic Italian feel. The depth in which Coppola goes to study these characters has to applauded too, giving some of the most well developed characters on the big screen. The way they are different and sometimes polar opposites , the way Sonny lacks control and is aggressive whilst Michael is very much in control and distant. This fascinating aspect helps develop events greatly. The violence makes more sense here, it's done to shape the characters views and set off new events instead of just being there for the sake of it. That idea is what also elevates the film, everything is done for a reason and fits in perfectly with the story giving most of the events much more weight and meaning than usual. The film also excellently sets up events, such as Michael warning Fredo not to side against the family and the move to Nevada, that would be explored in part II. There's not one bad thing about the whole film, one of the few films where that can be said. The Godfather remains incredibly gripping and intriguing all the way through thanks to the epic story, acting and directing."

Both The Godfather and The Godfather Part II were selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990 and 1993, respectively. International critics routinely list these two among cinema's pinnacle achievements, sometimes considering them as one work. In the decennial 2002 Sight & Sound poll of film directors, the pair was ranked as the second best film of all time. Previous Mafia movies had looked at the gangs from the perspective of an outraged outsider. In contrast, The Godfather presents the gangster's perspective of the Mafia as a response to corrupt society. Although the Corleone family is presented as immensely rich and powerful, no scenes depict prostitution, gambling, loan sharking or other forms of racketeering."

His face was cold with majestic contempt. But there was something false in all this that Amerigo Bonasera sensed but did not yet understand.""You acted like the worst kind of degenerates,"" the judge said harshly. Yes, yes, thought Amerigo Bonasera. Animals.Animals. The two young men, glossy hair crew cut, scrubbed clean-cut faces composed into humble contrition, bowed their heads in submission.The judge went on. ""You acted like wild beasts in a jungle and you are fortunate you did not sexually molest that poor girl or I'd put you behind bars for twenty years."" The judge paused, his eyes beneath impressively thick brows flickered slyly toward the sallow-faced Amerigo Bonasera, then lowered to a stack of probation reports before him. He frowned and shrugged as if convinced against his own natural desire. He spoke again.""But because of your youth, your clean records, because of your fine families, and because the law in its majesty does not seek vengeance, I hereby sentence you to three years' confinement to the penitentiary. Sentence to be suspended.""Only forty years of professional mourning kept the overwhelming frustration and hatred from showing on Amerigo Bonasera's face. His beautiful young daughter was still in the hospital with her broken jaw wired together; and now these two animals went free? It had all been a farce. He watched the happy parents cluster around their darling sons. Oh, they were all happy now, they were smiling now.The black bile, sourly bitter, rose in Bonasera's throat, overflowed through tightly clenched teeth. He used his white linen pocket handkerchief and held it against his lips. He was standing so when the two young men strode freely up the aisle, confident and cool-eyed, smiling, not giving him so much as a glance. He let them pass without saying a word, pressing the fresh linen against his mouth.The parents of the animals were coming by now, two men and two women his age but more American in their dress. They glanced at him, shamefaced, yet in their eyes was an odd, triumphant defiance.Out of control, Bonasera leaned forward toward the aisle and shouted hoarsely, ""You will weep as I have wept--- I will make you weep as your children make me weep""--- the linen at his eyes now. The defense attorneys bringing up the rear swept their clients forward in a tight little band, enveloping the two young men, who had started back down the aisle as if to protect their parents. A huge bailiff moved quickly to block the row in which Bonasera stood. But it was not necessary.All his years in America, Amerigo Bonasera had trusted in law and order. And he had prospered thereby. Now, though his brain smoked with hatred, though wild visions of buying a gun and killing the two young men jangled the very bones of his skull, Bonasera turned to his still uncomprehending wife and explained to her, ""They have made fools of us."" He paused and then made his decision, no longer fearing the cost. ""For justice we must go on our knees to Don Corleone."""

The answer is simple, watch this movie to find out exactly what I mean.Family, honor, respect, loyalty, and most important of all FAITH! A man needs these basic and crucial aspects in his life. How can a building stand without a base, how can a car run without any gas? Everything has an action and reaction in life. You can let things go by or you can approach everything with confidence and reassurance from your base. A mans' family is his base, his love is infrastructure, and his faith is his concrete overlay. A man has three great possessions in life, those being love, family,and faith. Once he acquires that he will then begin to realize those loyal to him also respect him. This movie taught me fear isn't as good as respect. When people fear you; it'll only take one person to not be afraid and stand up to you to cause you to lose it all. Meanwhile respect held at such a higher platform could never be taken away. Knowledge is power, power gains respect and respect gets you paid.In conclusion this movie will definitely change the way you hold your values in life. Some for good, others for worse.Without all three of those it would be impossible for anyone to survive. Greatest movie of all times in my opinion!""DJ"""
137,5616,False,0.11280471316361884,"I'm not a fan of this type of movies, but since I like Al Pacino and I've heard so much about this so-called ""legendary"" Godfather, I decided to give it a try. I must say this is the most inexplicably overrated piece of trash I've ever seen. Judging from this opening statement I know that these film lovers will aggressively spout out and say that I am 100 percent from about the Godfather... BELIEVE ME when I say that it shouldn't be in the same breath as one of the greatest.Don't get me wrong however, there are a few good qualities which in some way does kind of show some good hallmarks for a good film. The tempo right from the start of the film isn't too bad as it does set a nice tone to the film and kind of signifies what sought of film this will be. In some parts the acting of Marlon Brando as the 'Don' and Al Pacino as Michael do put up good performances which again add's to that verisimilitude to not only the story but to the other characters that are within this film. Although these small film aspects can add to your experience of watching the Godfather, non of this excruciates from the fact that these good factors do have harsh limitations which evidently create more problems throughout the duration of the film.Even though I did say from the start that the tempo and the duration of the scenes and music is perfect in introducing the characters and some of the story aspects, this is all it does unfortunately. As it gets near enough to the middle point of the film, the whole story and tempo falls flat on it's face and in most parts of when they are talking to some other gang leaders does emphasise this point that sometimes in the film, some of the story elements don't really add up to which personal for me creates a lot of boredom. Another sought of example of this is perfectly clear when the character of Michael is in Italy to lay low from the killings that he committed... I find that the Italia sequence is a complete waste of time and primarily add's to this excuse of being nearly a 3 hour film which really it shouldn't be. This sequence just kills the flow and intensity of what will eventually happen; it postpones the inevitable in some fashion. Although again I did say that the acting from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is exceptionally fine, the majority of their performances not only add's to this lack of entertainment, but in a sense just makes me want to never watch this film ever again. Marlon Brando speaking with a husky voice and cotton in his mouth is incredibly ridiculous. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone suddenly turns, from a principled man who doesn't want to have anything to do with murder, into a ruthless criminal. What? This character has no depth, no consistency whatsoever. His relationships with women are so poorly portrayed, they add nothing to his development.If you want to see a good gangster film then personally I recommend watching 'The Departed' as it does have the same sought of Genre and does everything right in terms of it's interesting story telling between these two men which at times does have lot's of quirky but violent scenes in which is done perfectly right rather than have old men constantly talk non stop about mundane meaningless ideals.I give the Godfather a 7/10Alex Rabbitte"
138,5617,False,0.03739413891499153,"I had a rough time watching The Godfather, because all the universal acclaim was completely clouding my judgement on the movie, because instead of being able to watch the movie with clarity, all this time I was looking at the opinions of the general public as the basis of finding clear reasons why to like this movie. I know everyone praises the performances, the film's structure, and every subtle nuance, but listening to those opinions gave me the idea I should be looking at these details so I will see why this movie is so great.But to my realization, I wasn't trying to find any qualities that I, MYSELF, would love about the movie. I was too busy trying to find the details of what other people liked. I was watching based on the details other people hyped up too much. That's why I have to say, you have to watch The Godfather and put the hype completely behind you and just watch it for what it is just how you would any other movie. If you develop a true opinion of the movie, not based on the hype, then that's what really matters, whether you love it or hate it.I ended up watching The Godfather for the umpteenth time. Now, before this point I really didn't have an opinion on the movie. I honestly felt it was bland and didn't give me that sense of urgency a lot of my favorite movies give me, but I didn't hate it, but I also didn't love it. But this time, it clicked somehow. I enjoyed it, oddly. I honestly found a certain quality that is very hard to create in films.And that certain detail is how beautiful this movie is. Behind all the murders and the brooding feel of the film, there is a lot of beauty. It's atmosphere is something that contrasts so heavily with its dark plot. And not only visually, but this is also evident in the execution of the acting performances, and the mood of the story. After watching Apocalypse Now and The Godfather II, I finally started to understood Francis Ford Coppola's style of storytelling. Despite The Godfather being a gangster film, it's very subtle and does not have any melodrama. I feel this is something people cannot get past, because with its legacy as a movie, they expect it to be something more in-your-face that will give you an emotional hit-in-the-gut feeling, but to one's realization, he or she will realize it is not those things.I mean there is a beautiful score, but it too is very subtle. The movie actually benefits from silence and just let the characters most of the time direct the emotion of the plot. When watching this, I cannot believe how the actors were able to execute this difficult-to-accomplish feat. If you were to tell me how I would expect one of the best ever movies to come off as, I would've given you a narrow-minded answer. Now I realize how much film is just as open-ended as music. We cannot just experience or enjoy an album or a film one time and expecting to gain that satisfaction thinking we know it from the inside out. If we watch a movie a second time, we can discover subtle nuances that weren't obvious in the first viewing, almost as if we're watching it from a completely different angle. And that's the beauty of i Despite how subtle The Godfather is, it really is a sophisticated film with repeated viewings. Is The Godfather my favorite movie of all time? I don't even know if I have one particular favorite, but I would place it in my top ten along with Citizen Kane. My advice would be to find certain qualities that YOU would like about The Godfather and not to base it on the opinions of people telling you what is so awesome about it, because film is more open-ended than that to build expectations. We all have things that we personally love. What is the best thing about the movie? For you or anyone else, it could be the acting, the story, the settings, or some subtle nuance that everyone is ignorant of. I personally love the mystical feel of the atmosphere and I think that is better than telling someone its the best movie ever just because it is. I like to listen to personal opinion, because of the individuality aspect to it. And The Godfather is way more rewarding if you watch it as an individual and judge it on your principles of what makes a good film and not to trust someone else's certainty that is the best movie ever. It's okay if you still don't like the movie, but what is crucial is you give complete clarity in forming an opinion that is completely your own based on what is important to you, most of all. I don't see what other film lovers see in The Godfather, I only see what I love about it."

A lofty claim, but so far there is not a single picture elsewhere that I feel deserves that title. And you're going to find out why.The Godfather tells the sprawling tale of the Corleone family, a mafia family after the Second World War. Over the course of the 2 hours and 50 minute epic, you will see the best drama, characters and atmosphere to ever grace the screen.It starts with the Godfather Waltz theme, an iconic piece. Just like that, the stage is set for the most Italian film ever. I believe it was the producer who wanted Coppola to direct because he was Italian. He wanted audiences to ""smell the spaghetti"" watching this film. Anyway, we then cut to a man's face, talking to an unseen figure, pleading to him for justice. Emotion drips off every word. Every scene in the Godfather has purpose, every line of dialogue has meaning. The camera switches to the other side of the table- Marlon Brando sits, hair slicked, moustache, rose in suit, cat on lap, in all of his glory as Don Vito Corleone, one of the most iconic characters ever.Have I said 'iconic' a lot? Much of the Godfather is. The Don himself, Michael's rise, Sonny's temper, the offer you can't refuse.The setting is very important to the Godfather. 1946 New York is wonderfully put together, as well as the hills of Sicily and for a short period of time, Las Vegas. Every scene is full, no scene is filler. Inside of each scene is dialogue- lots of it. But you'll hang on to every word, because of the content and the flawless delivery. Action in the Godfather is sparse, but like the hits shown, short and brutal. You'll be kept on your toes. Anyone can die at any moment, and they do. The pacing is perfect.The characters are some of the greatest compiled in a film, and any of the major characters could carry a film on their own. The Don's mumble, appearance and honour are perfected by Brando. Pacino convincingly, slowly shows what being in a mafia family can do to even a kind boy who isn't a part of it. Tom Hagen is the logic and calm in the sea of guns and violence. And Sonny, with his temper and tongue steals scenes.Perfectly executed, the sweeping story is so well interwoven you might not get it all on the first viewing. It all makes sense though: everything happens for a reason, and everything is explained. From the beginning wedding, to the diner, and ending with Michael's transformation, the plot of the Godfather is one of the best.I hope I've convinced you to see this masterpiece, or if you've already seen it, see it again. No amount of talking can equal to actually seeing it.

The tale of a crime organization in the 1940s that go into a struggle for power when the leader is shot and hospitalized in a conspiracy, though continuously tended by his trusted sons, played by some of the now famous actors ever, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Al Pacino.

It's really dramatic without getting too dramatic which is the fine line between effective and ridiculous, and The Godfather balances on that line perfectly. Cinematography is a part of what gives this movie classic status, the camera work gives the Godfather a slightly sinister effect with the shadows which is more apparent in some scenes set at night.Performances are top notch from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and of course John Cazale. There much more great performances. The score of The Godfather is probably the best of all time. It helps the drama and settings.

I believe strongly that, this movie has a special place for everyone. Godfather makes clear the distinctions between conflict of interests and the power of mafia.I muscularly claim that, this movie is the best movie that ever made.

151,5630,False,0.11348266590883747,"The majority of critics will cite the definitive ""greatest film of all-time"" as Citizen Kane, but other films are regularly mentioned in conjunction, one of those being The Godfather. Many argue it is the finest example of such a medium. Both The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II won Best Picture in the years of 1972 and 1974. The films spawned continuously growing numbers of so-called ""gangster flicks"", most of them not having the same delicate, operatic beauty of Francis Ford Coppola's classic. At present, and forever more, the film will consistently rank among the most flawless; perfectly illustrating an era when American cinema really was at the top of its game.Charting the rise and fall of a ruthless family of high-class society members who have made their fortune through crime, The Godfather remains a story which enthrals and grasps the imagination of viewers from all generations. It is an essay of violence; nevertheless, some accuse the film of being a study of family, rather than of gangsters. Being that, technically speaking, the film uses ""gangsterism"" as a means of driving the film's key motifs, such as that of dedication and reliance to one's family. Kicking off with the wedding sequence the film details an Italian-American family's ascent into an intensifying success (and failure) through organised crime. After returning from the war, a reluctant Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) makes his best attempts at distancing himself from his Mafia ties. Unlike the rest of his brothers, he feels obliged to live a fruitful life as a law-abiding citizen, but due to obligations and regard for his family he soon becomes more inclined to ""join the family"" because of a number of pressing commitment and loyalty issues.Arguably, the theme of ""violence breeding violence"" is one which has been wildly overdone throughout cinema history. Yet The Godfather is a work which uses the theme to the best of its extent. The depiction of cold-blooded brutality within the picture has not lost any of its raw and painful pragmatism. Indeed, it is the ""matter-of-fact"" nature of the film which makes it unquestionably powerful. Since the violence portrayed is not particularly graphic, but presented in a way which strikes the viewer due to the what seems like- prolonged nature of the appearance. Essentially, much of The Godfather oozes a sense of unequalled menace, not due to the violence, but the scale of operatic themes conveyed through such an awe-inspiring sensation of film-making splendour.Every element participates in creating the finished version of a film, and The Godfather is a primary instance of even the most intricate details being perfected to a point of enabling the film to become entirely flawless. The masterpiece provides viewers with performances which remain unmatched in their scope, and rank among a league of their own. How the performers utilise their characters, while serving as a means of polishing the film is truly exceptional. Renowned actors, such as Marlon Brando, James Caan and Robert Duvall offer performances of such inconspicuous allure that they soon become almost unrecognisable from that of their character. To detail the performances would take a lifetime, being that there is such a considerable amount of material to analysis within career-defining performances, which offer more and more with each and every viewing. The performances are deliberately faultless so as to be valued and studied as each year goes by.The legendary and widely celebrated baptism scene coveys editing in a manner unlike practically anything made prior and following the film. A sequence crafted on an acrimonious feeling of guilt; permitting the work to become even more emotionally engaging and terrifying in its momentum. Cutting from the ""false"" commitment of Catholic oath, to the hiring of vicious contract killings it conveys the deepest feeling of tentative regret and unholy guilt. Gordon Willis' foreboding cinematography is a genuine accomplishment of epic proportions. The cinematography is the kind which has evidently stood the test of time, letting viewers relish the profound and unique aura of the elegantly gracious camera work through long, ominous takes and fragile pull-backs. It is of such sophistication that The Godfather compels its viewers to feel the impression of being in the company of an auteur. Next up is the score, remaining one of the crucial tones to the picture. Composed by Nino Rota, the score enhances the emotive style that the film follows throughout the duration.I have been watching The Godfather for many years now and it remains one of my unquestionably favourite films. Cinema has endured decades of revolution since The Godfather was first released, but The Godfather still stands tall above nearly all the gangster films which have followed in pursuit. A gangster predecessor which is slightly greater than that of The Godfather is Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas; nevertheless, that is still a debatable opinion of my own. I cannot begin to stress just how deserving The Godfather is of its appreciation, since it is a film which is deservedly identified and credited as a slice of perfection. To think that in 1979 Francis Ford Coppola released a film more superior than The Godfather (the film being Apocalypse Now); I believe this unmistakably puts his auteur status into glaring perspective. All this is much more than a fleeting glimpse of cinematic heaven, considering the viewer becomes just like one of the characters, a controlled puppet for a game, which -in the case of the film- does not manipulate, but engages."
152,5631,False,0.09233853175047554,"Some spoilers ahead.If you rent the ""Godfather"" DVD and listen to Copolla's comments about the production of the movie, it seems, from his view, that this film was plagued from the start with needling from Paramount studios. He was supposed to film ""The Godfather"" on the cheap with limited resources and constant input from the studio as to what he could do. He was regarded as such a bad director that he was almost fired from the task. His photo director (somebody with more knowledge of movie-making can correct me) thought Copolla didn't know what he was doing with what he thought were odd camera angles. It is the greatest irony of all that this movie became a timeless classic and propelled not only the fortunes of Paramount Studios in 1972, but launched the careers of Copolla as a director, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton as actors, and revived the once-glorious but then-moribund career of Marlon Brando (as you all know, he would later enter a second period of professional and personal decadence).Copolla was blessed with some of the best actors possible for this movie. Al Pacino was great as the mostly-taciturn but wily and cunning Michael Corleone, the true protagonist of the ""Godfather"" saga. I personally thought he, rather than Brando, should have won the Best Actor Oscar. Michael Caan gives his all as the bombastic and violent Sonny, Michael's older brother. Diane Keaton's performance has been called relatively weak, but I think this is not a fair assessment. She is very good as the naive and rather innocent girlfriend of Michael. Despite cries of nepotism in the casting decision, Talia Shire, Copolla's sister, does well as the battered and frantic sister of the Corleone clan. Robert Duvall is absolutely excellent as the ""brains"" of the Corleone family, Tom Hagen. Of course, Brando's performance is what will be most remembered of this movie, even though he is not on the screen as much as Pacino or Caan. He chose to be creative as the mumbling, aged, and rather stoic leader of the mob family. He is seldom over-the-top, which one may see as a relief to the stock character of the angry, vengeful gangster (Caan fulfills that role to the nines).Of course, overlooked are the performances of the secondary characters (whose names fail me, precisely because they never achieved fame and fortune on the scale of Pacino, Brando, Duvall, Keaton, or Caan). The guy who played ""The Turk"" Solozzo is a wonderful actor, and convincingly plays the character of the slimy drug-dealing antagonist. Sterling Hayden, who portrayed the loony ""Jack D. Ripper"" in ""Dr. Strangelove,"" also is quite good in his brief role as the evil police captain. I honestly can't be a fair judge of the characters of Fredo Corleone or the infamous henchman, Luca Brazi, as their time on the screen was rather brief. Still, for what it's worth, they did the best they could with what little screen time they had (John Cazale's Fedo would play a much more significant role in the ""Godfather"" sequel).The movie does have its fair amount of stylistic or memorable violence, but the screen in not chock full of nonstop guts and gore. Copolla's creativity as a director, and his use of stylistic devices, such as the frequent use of running children, dark, gloomy backgrounds, and music juxtaposed with violent images, makes this a highly entertaining movie. The characters are actually deep and make an impression on the viewer. This story is not Marlon's, but rather Pacino's, as we see his character grapple with his decision to join his family's criminal empire after his father is gunned down. We see him, based on his not-so-reluctant decision to murder the man responsible for shooting his father, Solozzo, slowly and credibly evolve from war hero who is not a member of the rackets, to being the ruthless head of the criminal empire. Copolla and Pacino keep us engaged in the story the whole time, with very few abrupt halts in the in the flow of the story.In short, this is the little film that, in spite of the huge problems it faced, payed off big in terms of box office receipts and critical acclaim. No movie buff should miss this masterpiece; average joes will love it too. Highly recommended."

The Godfather has all the makings of brilliant movie.The casting is classic with Marlon Brando's unforgettable interpretation of Vito Corleone and the level-headed and dark character of Michael, played by Al Pacino also in the film's two sequels. Aside from great characters the story, pacing and structure of the film has been designed in a way, that even after 2 hours of watching the same movie you still don't feel exhausted like you would with the 2+ hour epics of Peter Jackson.The movie is also incorrectly said to be dark and gory. Certainly the darkness is warranted, but the gore is set in the film rather sparingly and I would reckon the gore in the two later films much more disturbing, even if it's not as extensive. The violence is here to remind of us of the gritty reality of the film's world and it works in a same way as the great family-celebrations bring out the happier and lighter side of the life of a gangster.On all levels The Godfather is a brilliant picture. It's brilliantly acted, cast, directed and written. It is a movie with an old-timesy feel that feels fresh each time you watch it."

I remember trying to watch it a couple of times when I was in my early teens, but being unable to get into it. I'm 21 now and have finally gotten around to seeing this cinematic masterpiece, and it has now assumed the top spot in my personal list of favorite films.Everything about this movie is just so well done. The story is a modern epic. What's amazing is that I found myself literally on the edge of my seat for the entire three hours that this movie runs. Not once does it lag or draw out unnecessarily. Personally, I always feel that the longer a movie is the, the better, as it leaves more room for character and plot devolpment, but even in the best of the 170+ minute movies I've seen, there's always a few scenes that you feel could've been cut short or cut altogether. That never happens in The Godfather.The characters, particularly Vito Corleone (Brando) and Michael Corleone (Pacino), are so dynamic and have such rich backgrounds; this is the key to a good story, IMO. The dialogue is classic, as you'll no doubt recognize many of the lines and expressions that have been incorporated into our modern vernacular.There's so much more I wish to say about this movie, but I believe I'm running short on space. I'm a young man who doesn't always agree with critics and older audiences as to which films are truly classic. I've never been swayed to like a movie because others say it's great. So the fact that a 34-year old movie still has this kind of appeal to a younger audience is quite telling. I strongly encourage anyone of any age to see this movie. This is the pinnacle of American cinema."

160,5639,False,0.12062461831131459,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather,"" will remain an icon in movie history forever. It gives the audience what few films ever have; flawless and poetic storytelling. The script by Mario Puzo and Coppola (based on Puzo's masterful novel) is beat-by-beat perfect. It is also a study in the form of directing at its best. The legendary performances hold nothing back. It is the kind of movie that film students should be required to watch, because it is one of the few examples of flawless film-making in world history.""The Godfather"" tells us the story of the aging Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Don of an organized crime family in New York. The film is about the decisions he makes for family, love, and business. Whether or not that business is legal. Just as equally, it tells the story of the Godfather's son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), who doesn't wish to become part of his father's dirty business, but finds it hard to choose between right and wrong when it comes to family, pain, and suffering. Ultimately, the film is a tragedy. A tragedy about two family members who love one another, their wives, and their children, but are corrupted by the life around them. This film is also about that ""life"" around them, and the people organized crime affects. No matter what country. No matter when. It takes its toll.Marlon Brando, in his Oscar-winning performance, gives us one of the best on-screen performances of our time. Do not make the mistake, however, of thinking he is the main character. He shares the spotlight, very much so, with Al Pacino's Michael. Pacino gives us a career-making performance that will make your eyes widen. It's almost hard to believe he about lost his job, but with Coppola's persistence, the producers agreed to keep him on. Robert Duvall plays the family's lawyer and adviser, and adopted son to Vito Corleone. He gives one of his earlier, best performances in this movie. James Caan hits all the right notes as ""Sonny,"" Michael's brother, who handles his power with rough hands. A man, who, if he feels is right, will let you know about it. Whether by talking or through violence. Who can forget Diane Keaton? She plays Michael's wife. Who starts out in love, but may end up confused and startled. A terrific performance. There is also Talia Shire as Sonny and Michael's sister, Connie. She may make several mistakes, but is open, and worried about her life to come.Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola derived a fabulous script from a fabulous book. The dialogue rings true. It is deep and emotionally complex. It gave light to a gangster picture none had ever seen before. It was drafted like no other.Coppola is a rare storyteller. As director, he lead us into a world few knew about back then (or now), and did it accurately. His vision is tremendous, and few can even imagine what it must be like to have his talents.Overall, the picture, without a doubt, is a masterpiece. If you haven't seen it, and are doubtful of all of its awards and reviews, thinking that it might be overrated; don't. If anything, its underrated. Amazing."
161,5640,False,0.09386436905355788,"This was a classic that won best picture, and it was a long movie. This length was actually a necessary evil, however, as a lot went on during the course of the film and it's multiple reversals as well as requiring the time to not only introduce a myriad of characters, but fill them out to be real people.It took about 45 minutes for this film to pick up some steam and start going due to getting everyone introduced, but being a drama based on a book, the direction changed a few times during the course of the film. This slow start is at once alleviated on a second viewing, however, since knowing the characters the second time around, you ""get"" everything a lot more clearly and the momentum is obvious from the get-go.Vito Corleone is the Godfather, not only of the Corleone clan, but of many of the people he has come into contact with over the years, particularly in the Italian community. He creates many give and take relationship with a lot of people, and follows through on them. The first part of the film focuses on Vito and his reign as Don, then the focus shifts to between his sons, Michael and Sonny when the Don runs into a bit of trouble. Once Michael is placed center stage as the main character, and even on a first viewing, this was the point where the film really got into its groove and took off.It got a little slow while Michael ran off to Sicily, and that all seemed like a big side story we could deal without, but it allowed Sonny's reign to come and go, which was not necessarily a pleasant thing.The characters, as I said, were numerous and well-rounded, and it's just astounding how well they were drawn throughout the film. Granted, the length of the film allowed this luxury and a shorter film likely would have dropped all those little moments which make these fictional characters seem real, but it worked so well.It ended up being a solid film and certainly worthy of its Oscar. However, this movie should only be approached if you're in the mood to be thought-provoked."

166,5645,False,0.10693079744919745,"The year is 1970. F.F. Coppola has just directed ""The Rain People"" (1969), a good, but not great, movie, starring R. Duval and James Caan. Coppola is then offered to direct the Mario Puzzo best-seller, ""The Godfather"". Coppola accepts, but has his own suggestions for the leading roles: Marlon Brando shall incarnate Vito Corleone -the ""godfather"", while an unknown actor, someone called Al Pacino, is suggested for the most important role in the film; he'll play Michael Corleone, the second son of Vito, the soon-to-be godfather. Paramount isn't very keen of either suggestions. They'd prefer George C. Scott for the leading part and Dustin Hoffmann or Jack Nicholson for the role of Michael. Pacino is discarded for the unforgivable crime of being ""a midget"". Brando, the unconventional ""bad boy"", is out of question. Coppola finally got his way. Thankfully.Also starring are former collaborators -see the ""Rain People""- R. Duval and James Caan, while there are also a few Coppola-family members contributing: Talia Shire, Coppola's sister, stars and Carmine Coppola, Francis' father, writes the music, along with long-time Fellini collaborator, Nino Rota. Sophia Coppola, the director's daughter, also known as a director herself, makes also a snapshot in the movie -she's the girl who's being baptized at the end of the film.These were only unnecessary information. The point lies elsewhere: ""The Godfather"" is probably the best American movie of all times. It's not the flawless cinematography, nor the mesmerizing acting by all the actors. And it's not the simply breath-taking music score, or the amazing plot. It's the summary of all the above. It may sound childish, but I will say it: Everyone did their job splendidly.To start with, the plot is fascinating. Brando is the mafia godfather, a Shakespearian figure, who dances on the edge of life and death and has to pay. It's notable, that the audience feels sorry and sympathy for him, although he is a sheer killer. ""We're not butchers, despite what this undertaker thinks"", implies Vito in the beginning of the film. Simply brilliant: A killer is thought to be one by an undertaker. Does it get any better? Apparently, yes. Vito is shot nearly dead by a rival family and Michael appears on the screen. Revenge, business, interest and death are the ingredients of the rest of the film.Secondly, the acting is just sublime. Brando makes the best performance in his career -it's a draw with ""Apocalypse Now"". Caan is excellent, so's Duval. But the key-performance is the one from Pacino. He tries to evolve from a shy-idealist-soldier-boy to a coldblooded-evil-adult. And he succeeds. It's simply one of the very great performances ever.Thirdly, the music can't get any better. Written in the motives of Fellini's movies, Rota did his best. Can't get bettered.Finally, and most importantly, the cinematography stands above any criticism. There are so many memorable scenes: Brando's shooting, the wedding sequence, the Turk's murder by Pacino -this one's the key-scene of the film, the Sicily sequence, the scene in the garden between Vito and Michael, the ""double"" baptism, followed by the murders etc.It lasts more then two-and-a-half hours. But it doesn't show. It's so unique, so fascinating, that you're gonna ask for more. Are you searching for a flawless film? Stop searching; you're in the right place. Highly, no, hugely recommended.Thank you."

It exceeds expectations of what should be put into a movie from everyone involved.Coppola directs The Godfather with obsessive precision. Every shot is shown in its own way for a reason, and if something is put into place, it has a purpose. The cinematography for such a small-scale story is breathtaking. The shots of small, old-style Sicily villages and rain-soaked, film noir-ish New York streets are immensely innovative.With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando creates a personage that will be remembered for ever... The line ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" has reached legendary statues. Brando's Don Corleone is the moral center of the film: a tough, wise, feared old Sicilian who has risen to become an all powerful leader in an empire of Italian-American organized crime.Al Pacino's gradual and subtle transformation is the heart of the film. From a gentle man to one of the most cunning, ruthless, and cold-blooded man ever to come on the screen, he has learned from his father never to talk in front of outsiders and always keep his own counsel. His commandment: ""Never to take sides against the Family."" Although there may be no overt condemnation of the moral position of the Mafia, there is implied criticism of its bloodier deeds. All the characters, whatever the crimes of which they may be guilty, are careful to pay lip-service to the Catholic Church and its rituals. Throughout the film (indeed, throughout the trilogy as a whole) the traditional ceremonies of the Church form a backdrop to various criminal activities. ('The Godfather' begins with a wedding and ends with a baptism). It seemed to me that Coppola was using these scenes to make an ironic contrast between the values of organized crime and those of Christianity, especially at the end of the film. Michael, already a 'godfather' in the metaphorical sense of a Mafia boss, becomes one in the literal sense of a baptismal sponsor. Shots of him taking vows on behalf of his godchild to reject the works of the devil are intercut with shots of his enemies being gunned down on his orders.This is the first and most powerful installment in arguably the best trilogy in the history of film.

The acting, directing, cinematography, score, and script are all of the highest possible calibermaking the near three-hour running time more of a blessing than an inconvenience. The Godfather is not only the Don of all Mafia melodrama, but it is also the standard grade of superiority for critics and filmmakers alike.Based on Mario Puzo's bestseller of the same name, the story begins in 1945 at the wedding of Connie (Talia Shire), the daughter of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). Even on his daughter's day of celebration, Don Vito still manages to take care of ""business."" After a few men grace his presence and ask for a few favors  revenge, a leading role, etc.  the Don unites with his family for the ceremony. His youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who has recently returned home from war a hero, brings his new love Kay (Diane Keaton), and the Don's two older sons, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), along with his ""adopted"" son and confidant Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), also come to celebrate their sister's special occasion.With each of the five major mob families straining to gain ground on one another, the budding industry of narcotics presents a forum for a few to achieve a competitive advantage. However, it is Don Vito who declines Sollozzo (Al Lettieri), the drug supplier, of his offer to commence an involvement in narcotics trafficking. His son and heir apparent, Sonny, obviously disagrees with his father's choice  seeing that drugs are the wave of the future  but the Godfather does not concede. Don Vito understands that the drug industry is a cutthroat business where friends are few and far between. It is this rejection that spirals the Corleone family down a brutal one-way street that will both cost the five families many lives, and allow a new Don to emerge.Al Pacino plays the supporting role of Michael with fire in his eyes. His transformation, from a civilian to a Godfather in both senses of the term, is the film's main and most dynamic storyline. In almost every sense, Pacino steals the thunder out from under Brando; nonetheless, Brando's role is perhaps the most iconic role in all of cinema. His character, styled after real life mobster Frank Costello, is one of the films many highlights.Despite an unmistakable missed punch, a few continuity issues, and an abundance of character roles to keep straight, The Godfather remains one of the most influential films in cinematic history. Not only will Brando's husky whisper continue to be copied for generations to come, but also the only fruit that shares its name with its color will always signify an impending death or violent incident.Aside from all of the orange metaphors, The Godfather's resounding themes on the duality of man  love and hate, good and evil, loyalty and betrayal, and family and violence  allow it to emit an atmosphere like no other film. The Godfather is the utter embodiment of the ultimate ""guy film"", yet whether you are a male or female or a frequent or infrequent moviegoer is not dependent on how much appeal you will hold towards this first-rate pulp crime drama. Regardless of your status, you will be taken aback by its magnificence.On The Internet Movie Database's website, The Godfather is listed as the number one favorite movie of all time, and on The American Film Institute's chart of the ""100 Years100 Movies,"" it is listed as the number three greatest film. First or third, there is no question why The Godfather holds a spot on a myriad of Top 10 lists, mine included. It is a seminal classic that will only continue to steamroll sovereignty, praise, and admiration."
176,5655,False,0.08767933952248007,"Francis Ford Coppola has done some brilliant work, but he has never been better than in The Godfather and the sequel. This is a complex story set in New York City in the era just after World War II. It involves the Corleone Family, an Italian-American family that has thrived in the U.S. as the father of the clan (Vito Corleone/Marlon Brando) turned to organized crime to gain his slice of the American Pie. I won't get into the plot too much for fear of invoking the ""spoiler"" rule, but the essential plot revolves around a dispute between the Corleone Family and one of the other crime families over Corleone's unwillingness to engage in the illegal drug trade.Although the movie is strictly Hollywood fantasy in its treatment of the American Mafia (it is NOT this glamorous), the Godfather does play on some real life plot twists in the history of the mafia. For example, Carlo Gambino, the head of the most powerful of New York's Five Families for decades, did in fact have a strong moral and practical opposition to the drug trade which led to his famous edict of ""deal and die"" for those under his command.The plot is a modern version of a Shakespaerean or Greek tragedy as the family patriarch(s) rationalize their actions in the name of protecting the family. It's a classic plot line that has been around for centuries, but it has never been better than in the Godfather. The direction is fantastic and the acting is unreal. Brando as the father is flawless, and Al Pacino and James Caan are brilliant as the sons. Also, the supporting cast is also first rate. Look for great supporting roles from Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Sterling Hayden and a host of other talented actors.Anyone who doesn't love this movie is either lying or just trying to cause trouble. 10 out 10 for sure."

Phenomenal acting, but the life of a mob guy is violent and depraved (and often broke). The most realistic mob movie I have ever seen is Donnie Brasco. This is what mob life is really like. Mob life is about a million miles from being romantic. Carlito's Way is another realistic (more or less) look at street crime life. you watch this movie for the phenomenal acting, not for realism in any way. Hollywood loves to capitalize off stories of gangsters, glorify it up a bit, and package it as if it were real. What's real is busting your hump, not making enough in a month so you have to sell dope, and wondering if there is a gun at your head every second of the day. to be honest, I'd rather sell staplers."

The Godfather trilogy is a magnificent saga about the Corleone family and it's way to the top of the American mob.Afcourse and their way into the high society of admired people.But,behind this story lies one more story,as complex as the first,about higher values,family,love and respect.It is very interesting to see Vito Andolini's(Marlon Brando) way from his departure from Sicily,where he was on the run because local boss Don Cicci wanted to kill him because he thought that Vito is going to take revenge on him for killing his father and brother,to New York's ''Litlle Itally'' where he is living like a bum.Although Vito had a really small wage,he bought a pear every day and brought it to his wife to show his love,respect and gratitude.Later,Vito became a very wise man and the king of the Mafia. God never gives without taking.Don Vito in one of his wars with the other families lost his oldest son,Sonny(James Caan).So, today we all know a old Mafia saying:For revenge always kill the brother. It means that you never kill the man that brought you harm,but you should kill someone that is closest to his heart.It will hurt more.On this way Vito's youngest son (Al Pacino) and his ''grandson'' (Andy Garcia) will lose their wives.And there is one more thing that the movie shows the best.What money can do to a man!When their parents die Michael kills Fredo because he let him down.Horrible,but logic.The movie is filled with great actors.James Caan is a real hot-head,old school wise guy.Al Pacino is also great as a man that doesn't want to meddle into family business but then becomes a killer.MARLON BRANDO is.... i really can't find the word to describe it.He made the most known role in the world as the rightful Don.Marlon magnificently paint a portrait of a man who doesn't forget the friendship shown to him and is willing to help anybody that respects him.If somebody shows hate to the Don,he makes him an offer he can't refuse and deals with him quickly.The words that illustrate how much is Brando a good actor,are the words that Nicholson spoke on Brando's funeral:''Now,when Marlon is gone,all we actors will rise a few steps above''.A unmissable classic"

The merit of the film is obviously its plot, but the director Coppola did an excellent work to unite several good actors/actresses in this production. Al Pacino was starting at that time, and he did superb work as Michael, James Caan showed his abilities as Sony, Robert Duvall and Marlon Brando were excellent as usual, while Diane Keaton and Talia Shire did what was required from them. The film goes from New York to Sicily then back to New York, it certainly made the small village of Corleone very famous, many tourists coming from America may ignore the existence of Greek ruins in several parts of the island, particularly in the town Agrigento, but they do know that Corleone is there. Another admirable aspect of the film is that those actors representing Italians of Italo-Americans talk either in English, in Italian and even in Sicilian dialect. It is not my intention to describe the plot of the film here, but it shows that each of the families has an affective feeling to its relatives but is cruel at the time of punishment, no matter if it is a relative or not."
180,5659,False,0.11277441711204494,This is many peoples favourite film of all time. Vito Corleone is the Godfather and is the head of a powerful mafia family. Although heavily involved in organised crime the Corleone empire is very much underpinned by trust and honour.The real story of the Godfather is how Michael changes from being an ordinary citizen with no desire to be involved in the gangster lifestyle to eventually become the head of the family. The catalyst for this is the attempted assassination of Vito during a mafia war caused by Vito's unwillingness to become involved in drugs.The acting is quite superb and you shouldn't forget that Al Pacino was a relative unknown when this was released. Marlon Brando won the best actor award for Vito. The screenplay is superb and like all the best films you become extremely involved with several of the characters. A true classic.

It was totally original at it's time and today, it is filled with great performances that set up wonderful careers, and it is overflowing with drama, romance, mystery, intrigue, action, and tragedy. This epic follows the Corleone family's trials and tribulations in New York and Italy. Vito is the don, Michael, Fredo, and Sonny are his three sons and Tom is his consigliere. This is my favorite of the GF movies. My favorite character is Sonny played by James Caan. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and the late John Cazale are all excellent. In my opinion Goodfellas is the best mob movie ever, but this pulls in an ultra close second. 9/10"

It marks the end of one's control of a territory and the dawning of a new era when Pacino takes over the ""family"" business.If you haven't seen this movie, yet, do yourself a favor: don't wait 30 years like I did.  Watch it!  It was on one of the premium channels the other night and I taped it.  I knew it was three hours long and I always thought I would not have the patience to watch it, but I did.

I would like to point out that characters in the book have the last names of some of the people part of the movie, Anthony Coppola is one character obviously the relation is with Francis Ford Coppola, I forgot the first name but there was a Mancini as one character, the relation is the guy who did the them song's name is Henry Mancini. Also the producer did a great job of picking all Italian people, I heard somewhere that they almost picked Robert Redford for the job as Michael Corleone, somewhere on television, once I heard this I new it was one of the worst picks ever, I don't know how the producer could've picked that but the rest of the cast is tremendous. This is also great because nobody thought of the mafia underworld idea until Mario Puzo came out with the book, nobody knew how to make the book into the movie, and some people didn't think of making the book into the movie. A lot of people say the second one is better than the first, I would say no on that, because there's nothing better than the oringinal, the second one was excellent, but not as good as the first because it was as entertaining as the first, the things that almost bored me was the family situations, family crisis, not a lot of action, and shooting. In the first one the kills were more out of no where, and surprising me, like when the man went to take a leak, and on the way back the guy killed the guy, a brilliant set up. This movie is tremendous and wonder why would anybody give it a one, because I saw on the voting charts there was a 1.6, for the ones, maybe they don't recognize the excellence, and art of this movie, but I would like to say the movie is brilliant, I gave it a 10, and I hope you do to."

Finally, I rented The Godfather and it was even better than all that I had heard from everyone.  Although I think Al Pacino has the potential to be a great actor, I haven't cared much for seeing him in movies because he always seems the exact same. However, in The Godfather he was different (yet still the same).  I saw much more versatility in him...from young and full of ideals to finally finding his place in the family business.  He wasn't his usual over the top ""HOOHA"" thug like in so many movies.  Quite refreshing.  Marlon Brando has always been one of my favorites and his performance was fantastic...fitting right into his role like a hand to a glove.The Godfather has become one of my all time favorite movies and the more I watch it, the more I discover what I hadn't noticed in prior viewings.  To me, this is a timeless piece that only gets better with each time you watch the movie.  It definitely has lost none of its appeal in the years gone by.Without a doubt, The Godfather earns a 10 out 10 stars; and of course, is a DEFINITE must see.

Don't get me wrong, The Godfather is an excellent piece of work, but I wouldn't go so far to say it is the best movie ever made. Personally, I like GoodFellas a little better. The Godfather has the best of all the qualities for a movie = great directing, great writing (not as good as the book), excellent acting (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert DuVall), and all that jazz, but I still don't think it is the best movie ever made. One of the top 10 movies ever made (most likely), One of the top 5 movies ever made (maybe), the best movie ever made (I don't think so). If you like Mafia movies, this is the one that started them. If you are looking for the best Mafia movie or televison show, watch ""The Sopranos"" Sunday nights at 9:00 p.m. or 10:00 p.m. If you haven't seen ""The Godfather"" yet, I would rent it immediatley!

Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were all excellent in their supporting roles. I think Al Pacino was the best of all of them. Everyone else was great too. Diane Keaton was the only one who i did not care for. She just didn't really fit in.The acting is definitely a plus in the Godfather and so is its Directing.

There are a few scenes that take you by surprise, and a lot of plot twists.Marlon Brando and Al Pacino acted out their parts well. As ruthless as their characters were, as bad as the things they've done, you never cease to hope they get the last laugh. This movie was so dark, it's as if death was at every corner, and it was. The Godfather was an action movie with a story... a GOOD story. How often do we see those? Try never. I heard from everybody that this is the greatest movie ever, and my expectations for this movie grew and grew with every comment (I heard millions, and my expectations were already high).

Coppola has essentially one trick - intercuttung violence with religious ceremonies. In the first two Godfather films this is an extremely effective device. Unfortunately, some of the other parts of this film are not quite as well thought out. The scenes of Michael in Italy are too long and underdeveloped. Appolonia falls for Michael in a way that only happens in the movies so the audience has very little emotional investment in her or her death. Most people would say I'm nitpicking, but to be honest there are more than a few films that I have enjoyed more than the Godfather.
Having said that, this cast (Fred Roos is the greatest casting director ever) and crew might be the best group of talent ever assembled for one film.

There are also some ""holes"" in the screenplay: for instance, why do we see one of the Godfather's sons (Al Pacino) first like a shy guy and then like a determined and blood-thirsty beast? Only because they killed his sicilian wife that he forgets soon to marry another girl? The direction of Coppola is flat: I don't like the way he just throws away the ""crescendo"" of some thrilling scenes and the way he doesn't emphasized the story. Besides after some killings we get to know their ways, so the last killings are ""phoned""... we exactly know what is going to happen and so the surprise goes wasted. Only in the final Coppola succeeds in finding a beautiful alternated editing where he shows the deep contradictions of the members of the Mafia: Michael Corleone is in a Church where he swears to renounce the Devil and in the meanwhile his men are making a massacre.

The writing, direction, and cinemetography are all superb, and there isn't a bad performance in the film.  Coppolla captures the look and feel of New York in the late 1940s, then introduces us to an underworld of his own creation.The opening scene, the wedding of the daughter of Don Vito Corleone, is the longest wedding scene I've seen in any movie and not a moment is wasted. Virtually every character and plot twist that appears later in the movie is introduced here.  When the baker mentions to the Don the Italina POW his daughter wants to marry, we never see the boy, yet he shows up at the hospital later in the movie, just before Michael's introduction to McCluskey.Marlon Brando's performance in this movie is so strong, his presence and his character so dominate the picture, that for twenty years it never occurred to me that the title character was not Vito but Michael.  It was not until I was an adult that I realized that the tragic conflicts in the picture were Michael's and not Vito's.  Vito's time and world were fading and it was time for him to leave with it.  Michael subordinates his personal dreams of achievement outside of the family to serve the family when it needs him. Once he's drawn into the family concerns, he is trapped.  As he takes on the responsibilities of family leadership and grows as a man, his options outside the family diminish and he loses the freedom to be the man he had hoped to become.One of the things movies give us are the images that stay with us.  This movie is full of them:  Sonny's beating of Carlo, the mass murder interposed with the baptism at the end, a disconsolate Fredo on the curb, Vito in the garden with his grandson, and of course, the horse's head.

I have not gotten bored by watching it, thus I wait for a next opportunity to watch it again. The problem is that now I feels like a 90 minutes movie instead of a 171 minute film. But it's still great. I saw the three movies in one day, and let me tell you that the movie changed my life. My mind thought differently and I began to feel stronger, better self confidence. I'm not saying that I started to kill, but I can relate to this film. Probably I'm not the only Godfather fan with this feeling. I can confess that I've not read the book, but before I die I will read it. I recommend this movie to anyone that hasn't seen it. It's worth it. I wish I were born before the movie came out so I could see it at a movie theater. I am waiting for the DVD version, and I hope it comes out soon. So I guess I will have to buy a DVD player!!! But for now I enjoy it in VHS digitally remastered. The acting is incredible, like if the actors were real, like if the Corleone Family really existed or does exist."

It is quite simply a great film in every respect.  I won't rehash all the points that affirm why this picture is an undisputed classic that will be as relevant 50 years from now as it was in 1972.  The sequels, Godfather Part II and Part III, complete the story.  Part II got the praise it deserved becoming the first and only sequel ever to win a Best Picture Academy Award. Unfortunately, Part III suffered from too much anticipatory hope that germinated from the 16 years between the two films. In other words, the film was held to a standard that would be impossible to achieve.  It was masterfully told and with the same attention to detail given the earlier films, but a fair assessment was not to be given.  Al Pacino's performance was outstanding, especially in the final scene with his reaction to death of Mary.  It is a stunning and thoroughly heartbreaking expression of grief from a father who has lost a child.  I wrote about Part III because many have dismissed it as a lesser film not up to par with the others, but this is criminally unfair.  One last comment about The Godfather films -- some have suggested that the films are too long.  Well, that's just a stupid thing to say.  It's like the King in Amadeus telling Mozart that his composition has ""too many notes"". Mozart asks, ""which notes would you cut""?  The Godfather films are too complex to be shortened to accommodate those with a short attention span.

I learned that movies that are made like this are hard to resist watching.This film was based on the unforgettable novel by the late Mario Puzo and it was wonderfully adapted into the story that was written by Puzo himself and Francis Ford Coppola, who directed the film.The film is like the book itself, it's extraordinary and respects the subject that it focuses on.  Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are terrific in their roles and there are several scenes that left me both surprised and in awe.  Some of the violent moments aren't only graphic, but very grizzly as well.  The baptism massacre, one scene where Sonny (James Caan) is setup and is shot up like a piece of Swiss cheese, and another scene where Vito (Brando) is shot in public and Fredo (the late John Cazale) can't even shoot the two hoodlums best illustrate how ugly living in the Mob can get.Besides the other film that was directed by Coppola (""Apocolyspe Now"") that I deeply cherish, this film has a great supporting cast and I've mentioned a few of those key actors.Even Coppola's daughter, Sofia, who would later star in the third ""Godfather"" film and have also directed her first film (""The Virgin Suicides""), is unbilled as the baby that is baptised in the church before the unpleasant massacre starts."

One perfectly realized scene flows after another, building one on top of the other. A moment of family and togetherness here, a crescendo of violence there, betrayal, duty, honor.  It follows most of the rules established in early 30's gangster films like Scarface, Public Enemy and Little Caesar but is not limited in what it can show and attempts to tone down the melodramatics to a more realistically paced level.   Nearly flawless.  Some of the finest casting and ensemble acting you will ever see in a film by a brilliant director at the top of his craft.  It makes no apologies for forcing you to care deeply for characters who are violent, selfish, greedy criminals.  It makes us believe that at times there really is honor among thieves.

America has always had a romantic fascination with organized crime and this film takes us inside `the family' like never before.The script is nearly flawless.  The dialogue is engaging and emotional and the pace never lets up.  The story is mesmerizing.  The characters are so carefully and intimately developed that we can't help but get emotionally involved with them.  Though the violence is graphic and disturbing, it is never random or gratuitous and always has a direct link to a vital plot element.However, the appeal of this film goes beyond its great script to the characters and the actors who played them.  The ensemble has such amazing chemistry that it hard to imagine they are not actually related to one another.  They have such charisma that we fall in love with every member of this band of ruthless criminals, despite their moral decadence.  We come to understand that they are immoral by our standards, but not amoral, since they have their own codes of honor that they take very seriously.Though this was more of an ensemble piece than the sequels, two actors clearly stand out, namely Marlon Brando and Al Pacino.  Brando was already an established superstar at that point, although he hadn't had a meaty role in a few years.  His performance as Don Vito was powerful and commanding. Outstanding as he was, it was probably not his best performance (See `On The Waterfront', `A Streetcar Named Desire', or `Mutiny On The Bounty'), yet it is the one for which he is most famous.  Brando redefined our notions of the mafia patriarch from that of a ruthless dictator, to a shrewd diplomat who only wielded power when absolutely necessary.  He presented him as a potent but sympathetic character with a cunning mind and an astute understanding of the human dynamics of the other families.Pacino, in contrast, was a fresh face with only two films to his credit at that time.  Despite his lack of film experience, he delivered a tour de force performance portraying a complex character that required a great deal of range.  Michael Corleone starts as a goody two shoes and is ultimately hardened into a cold-blooded crime boss, with a touching romantic interlude along the way.  Pacino shined in every scene and established himself as one of the truly great actors of our time.Other standouts include Robert Duvall and James Caan, who was brilliant as the hot headed Sonny Corleone.  Caan's performance was raw, brutal and visceral, yet he somehow was able to render Sonny a magnetic and charming character with a strong sense of family loyalty.This film was nominated for nine Academy Awards in 1973 and won three, including Best Actor for Brando and Best Picture.  It is one of the very few videos that I actually own.  It is hard to imagine that anyone born before 1982 hasn't seen it yet, but if you haven't, you should make it the very next film you see.

Also, having read the book, there are some interesting characters and sub-plots that are hardly developed in either this move or the sequel.  The character of Luca Bracci was never fully appreciated in the movie and he appears almost to be a buffoon.  In the book he is an incredibly feared individual that had wiped out some competing mobs single handedly.

But the power that can come from a normal man explodes in this movie (Rockaway). The people who rate The Fighter or the Godfather with high ratings or liked it any are people with a low IQ. They probably like these types of movies because cuz they like crime, like the Godfather. The godfather is trash. This little dude in (Rockaway 2007) this movie mostly uses intelligence to take down the mob and its godfather. I cannot stand the movie the godfather because America is praising crime and gangsters. This movie shows how one mans determination to stop a gang of thugs is expelled mostly with intelligence training determination and more. I cannot stand the Oscar and academy award panel- they do not know how to judge films. I will sing to everything good when the day comes and people stop admiring trash like The Fighter and The Godfather. I get a kick out of the movie Rockaway because the character can be a good role model. He is not a criminal, drug addict, and he isn't stupid. When we watch The Fighter, or The Godfather, you see top American actors committing crime, drugs, and utter stupidity. But in Rockaway, a regular American, or hispanic, not sure, man comes back to town to take down the entire Russian mob. He even takes down the Godfather of the mob while he is blind, after his eyes were taken out. I am thankful that I am not stupid enough to be excited when the bad guys (mobsters) win. I am the type of guy that likes to go to work without the mafia trying to get in my way.

Directed by Francis Ford Coppola from a screenplay structured by Mario Puzo, The Godfather is an American crime film starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as leaders of a fictional New York crime family of Italian descent. The story primarily is centered on Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) and his transformation from a family outsider to the apparent heir to the title that is The Godfather, initially held by Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando). The beauty of the screenplay is not in its simplicity, but in subtlety. The Godfather, is that the story is played out entirely in a closed world. The audience is sucked into admiring the characters that are essentially evil. The movie portrays the Mafia, from the inside; its structure, its functioning, its virtues and imperfections included.Now coming to the performances of the lead actors - Marlon Brando, Al Pacino. Vito Corleone, as the Godfather, is the moral centre of the movie. He understands that liquor, gambling and even women are crimes that the world has a place for, but drugs is a strict NO. Marlon Brando, plays one of his more memorable characters in the suppressed, authoritative Sicilian.Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone, is brilliant.

Other films would be compared to the real thing, and very few got anywhere near this original Classic. Its now 40 years later, and were still waiting for a real challenger. Of course--its not going to happen. A movie like The Godfather could never be made today. We have directors who don't care to even try !! I understand that. It would require vision and a rich talent that skips several generations. It was Coppola who refused to back down when the studio brass wanted Ernest Borgnine for the lead role. He demanded Brando.

239,5718,False,0.15506550209673248,"The opening title and scene of ""The Godfather"" is one of the most striking in cinematic history. The lone trumpet invoking the tragic melody which has become so synonymous with this film is the equivalent of the tenor voice from an Italian opera, lamenting the loss of a loved-one in song, similar in style to a theme by Puccini or Verdi. Strangely, this sort of aria would have occurred towards the end of a traditional opera, usually at the death of the leading lady. But here the grieving music begins the story, as if tragic moments have already occurred, although they will continue to occur, a fundamental part of the story which is to follow. The beginning of the film is in actuality the middle of the larger epic of the Corleone family in America.The first spoken words are neither from the Godfather himself nor from one of those in his inner circle. The voice is an outsider. He is not only an outsider of the inner Corleone family but someone not originally from America. The first voice we hear is an Italian immigrant, ""I believe in America."" This is a story about American immigrants, and how they have attained great financial and political power in the United States which might not be possible elsewhere in the world.Based on the original book by Mario Puzo (who also co-wrote the screenplay), ""the Godfather"" lives up to its name as both a title referring to a specific character and simultaneously a position of someone wielding great power within a particular social context. When the film begins with Signore Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto who will be ever-remembered as the first voice and face of ""the Godfather""), the Italian immigrant requesting a favor from the Don on his daughter's wedding day, we assume the Godfather is Don Corleone (Marlon Brando), which is correct by and large. But as the film progresses, we see the rise of his younger son Michael Corleone who at first disassociates himself from the crime activities of his family. But even he cannot help but be dragged into the dealings of his family. By film's end it is ambiguous to which the titles refers, an individual person or a high-power position, not unlike a nobleman from the time of the Italian Renaissance.Strangely, traditions are portrayed in this film which have their roots centuries before the incarnation of the United States. All the main characters, with the possible exception of Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), are Catholic-Italian. The church, presumably on the outskirts of New York City, is in an architectural style similar to the medieval Gothic cathedrals of France and Italy. At the wedding at the beginning of the film, Italian songs are sung with traditional instruments. Only when a Frank Sinatra-like character, Johnny Fontane (Al Martino), appears at the wedding, do we remember we're in America in the 1940's and not a little town in Italy in the 19th century.""The Godfather"" chronicles several intertwined stories which was certainly highly innovative when it was produced. The very beginning of a plot concerns Sollozzo ""the Turk"" (Al Lettieri) who is a high-stakes heroin peddler who wants to use the Mafia families to sell his goods. He has already convinced the other Mafia families that drugs are the future but needs the Corleone family because of their political and law-enforcement connections. Don Corleone declines his offers at a meeting. But Satino ""Sonny"" Corleone (James Caan) makes a fatal slip, letting Sollozzo know there is slight ambivalence in the family about getting into the narcotics racket. Don Corleone becomes a target, and Sollozzo hopes by getting him out of the way, the Corleone family will reconsider their position on the illegal drug markets. Eventually this leads to an inter-Mafia war among the five New York families.The other story concerns Michael Corleone, his relationship with Kay Adams, presumably a WASP, and his initially tenuous relationship with his own family. Although Marlon Brando was top-billed for the film and won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, Al Pacino as Michael Corleone has much more screen time. The film is really Michael's story, about his gradual involvement in the family business. Several of the most memorable scenes involve Michael Corleone rather than Don Corleone, not the least of which occur in the home country of Sicily when Michael is in exile.Maybe a dozen films in existence could be characterized as perfect, nearly flawless, from beginning-to-end: Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Gandhi, Schindler's List, and Malcolm X, are a few which come to mind. ""The Godfather"" not only deserves a spot, it may be at the top of the heap. Every scene, even every line, furthers story, character, and even the world of the Corleones. Each of the other actors aside from Brando and Pacino could have won an Academy Award for their efforts, including James Caan, Talia Shire, Al Lettieri, Diane Keaton, and Robert Duvall. In fact, Pacino, Caan, and Duvall were all nominated for Best Supporting Actor, maybe the only time in film history three nominees from the same film were in the same category. ""The Godfather"" is one of the bona fide epic masterpieces of cinematic history, an opera without the singing."

'The Godfather', known to be one of the greatest films ever made, is a stab on it's viewer. Francis Ford Coppola has directed it with his instincts, he knows that Mr.Vito Corleone & Family do not exist in real-life. What embodies in an otherwise great film, are it's performances. Late Marlon Brando is stunning as The Godfather. 'THE' actor inside him buries his past and beings a fresh journey here. James Caan as Sonny, is another astonishing performance.'The Godfather' not only personifies power, but also it's MAJOR disadvantages. Let me end this review, this way: If a 1000 plus word review justifies this masterful depresso, I better inform you, that, even a half-page review is a near-perfect respect."
241,5720,False,0.12264443730051887,"¨I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.¨ Many people consider the 70's to be the Golden Age in Cinema, and if that is the case then Francis Ford Coppola had a great deal to do with it. During that decade he directed The Godfather Part 1 and 2, The Conversation, and Apocalypse Now; he also produced American Graffiti, and wrote the screenplay for Patton. During that time he won 5 Oscars and was nominated for another seven. At least one of these films is on everybody's favorite movies list, and The Godfather is considered by many critics to be the best film of all time. Despite being nominated for eleven Oscars it only took home three (Best Picture, Best Performance by Marlon Brando, and Best Screenplay), just one more confirmation that a film can't be judged by the amount of awards it receives. The Godfather deserves much more. It is a movie that has transcended time and is enjoyed by everyone even decades after its first release. It was the first of its kind to portray the mafia from the inside and Coppola does a great job at romanticizing them and making us root for these criminals. How does he do it? By showing us the mafia as a strong and united family that supports each other; portraying the good guys as bad (there are corrupt cops and politicians); and making Vito Corleone stand out from the rest of the criminal families by not wanting to get involved in the drug business. He completely romanticizes the Corleone family and has us rooting for them from the very first scene thanks to a very intelligent script co-written with Mario Puzo who had previously written the bestselling novel. The script is amazing, the performances are great, and the direction from Coppola is just superb. All these elements combine perfectly to create this classic masterpiece.We are introduced to Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) in the opening scene. He is head of one of the five New York Mafia families, and is attending his daughter's wedding. The wedding serves as a great excuse for Coppola to introduce all the characters because the entire family is gathered at the wedding. Vito is the Godfather for many of the people invited and he is treated with a great deal of respect. Tradition has it that no Sicilian can refuse requests on their daughter's wedding day, so Vito is attending some of his associates who are in need of favors. His sons Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale) are in the family business along with Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the family lawyer and consigliere, who was adopted by Vito at a very young age and is like a son to him as well. His youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), a World War II veteran shows up with his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) and is talking to her about his family. This conversation also serves as a perfect excuse to hear anecdotes about the family's criminal life and we are informed at once that Michael is the only one who is not involved in the family business. He has decided to stay away from the criminal lifestyle and is respected by his family. The entire plot takes place inside the world of the Corleone family and during a time where significant change begins to take place. Vito will have to make an important decision whether or not the family should protect a wealthy man named The Turk (Al Lettieri) who is trying to bring heroin into the city, or stick to the harmless gambling and alcohol business. He better think things carefully because his decision could have consequences.The Godfather is without a doubt a masterpiece and the cast has a great deal to do with it. James Caan and Robert Duvall had worked with Coppola in his previous film, The Rain People, and now they returned again with significant roles. They give great performances, but who really stands out in this movie is Marlon Brando who really becomes the Don. He gives one of the most memorable and all-time best movie performances in film history. Al Pacino hadn't made a significant movie before and the transformation he goes through in this film is incredible. His character is the one who experiences the most change if we recall his first appearance in the wedding and his last one in the Baptism scene. The screenplay is also very well written, the story completely hooks us from the very beginning, the characters are unforgettable, and Coppola just did a great job with the direction as he immersed us inside this world of crime. Of course we know that the mob world isn't anything like this and it has been romanticized by Hollywood, but Coppola managed to make us care for these criminals who actually don't see themselves as the villains. Nino Rota's score is just amazing and breathtaking; it helps build the suspense.The Baptism parallel action scene is one of the best ones in film history and has since been imitated endlessly in most action films, although never with the same effect. This is required viewing for everyone, one of the greatest achievements in film history.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

We don't understand it, we miss the points, and we fail to see the subtext in it. It saddens me that that is what the film business has become, when we fail to see a masterpiece when it comes along.

It is intense, gut wrenching, edited flawlessly. It takes an outstanding book and cranks it up a notch. It's hard for me to comment because, as a rule, I don't like movies about organized crime. First, I fear the reality of it. It holds a power in this country that we must always be aware of. It is in so much of our world, more than we realize. I feel at times that glamorizing these individuals is destructive. Nevertheless, I have to put that aside because this is the subject matter and at no time has anyone so masterfully put on screen the portrayal of these thugs, who see themselves as family as Coppola. I got the shivers walking out of the movie. Unlike horror movies where it's over and done with (with the exception of ""Deliverance"" which I will never get out of my mind), this haunts one for days after. I watched this again a few weeks ago, and what we have is a milieu that separates itself from out mundane existences. These people choose to live in a violent world of their own choosing. One issue that always gets me is, how do they enjoy the fruits of their ""labor""? It seems that a hell on earth is created for them.

In a cast with such top actors as Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, James Caan and John Cazale -among many others- he clearly stands out. In fact, I had the feeling that their performances got even better -if possible- after Brando passes away and is out of the picture. Few Oscars for Best Actor have been awarded with more justice than the one Brando got in this one. Old timers -even for 1972- Sterling Hayden and Richard Conte both in short roles, are also a major nostalgic ingredient that raises the movie for those of us who saw them often on the screen through the 50's.No much more to say on this extraordinary film except perhaps that the two sequels that followed, great movies too, are one clear step below The Godfather."

Everything from the acting (with a cast like Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and so on) you cannot go wrong! Nino Rota's score is fantastic and superbly integrated into the film. Marlon Brando gives a powerhouse performance of a lifetime as the now infamous Don Vito Corleone and the music is now referred to as the quintessential mafia music.Not much needs to be explained about the plot as I'm sure almost everyone knows about it. It centers around the Corleone family and their rise through the world of crime. The family consists of Don Vito (Marlon Brando), Michael (Al Pacino), Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale).I could rave on for ages about why this film is so good but I don't think I need to. The actors capture their roles perfectly and give them depth and emotion. Francis Ford Coppola's directing couldn't have been better, he captures the mood of the 40's and the underground crime world perfectly. He creates an epic, soap-operish feel of a families rise to power through corruption and murder. Nothing at all looks cheap or hokey, the special effects are nasty and the cinematography is beautiful.

If you free The Godfather from this weighty title, it still deserves a 10 by any standard.Let's rewind, and consider the insanity it took, back in 1971, to even contemplate giving a relatively novice director free reign to adapt a vast crime saga, in a costly period setting, and starring an ""ethnic"" nobody and a faded has-been. The Godfather is first and foremost a triumph of screen writing, Coppola's original forte, but the fine structure, character moments and dialogue could have been tarnished by a by-the- numbers treatment, and this where the film leaps from good to great.What makes The Godfather one of the finest films ever made is how right all the individual pieces are, and how well they work in unison: the performances, all of them rich and credible, from Pacino's star-making turn to Brando's classic creation; the world of the story, rich and murky, in perfect service of the story; the look, courtesy of groundbreaking work from ace cinematographer Gordon Willis... But dig deeper and it's the small touches Coppola meticulously peppered his film with that make it unforgettable, be it a touching death in an orange grove, or hit men debating the perfect gnocchi recipe.Ultimately, its rewards are double what you'd expect, because, by most accounts (though I still prefer this one), Part II is even better.Unmissable!"

This mob boss doesn't play around, even though he has a bull's eye painted on him. My mom has seen this movie before I came to the world, and I had to see it first on my own time, and she was right, it is good.

He's a self made American gangster who came up biting and crawling. The American mob however is different from its Sicilian progenitor racked with such vendetta driven violence that whole cities are decimated. The American offspring is a business.

The true importance of the movie lies in this, not within the vicissitudes of tit-for-tat murders.Coppola could have played with the Fontaine thread, which is all about the control of Hollywood (and by extension, control of us) through movie vision, but this is almost completely ignored here.One nice touch, straying from the novel; Moe Greene gets it in the eye -- layered symbolism -- of how one 'vision' of the Corleone future is snuffed out, in favor of the violent ""New Cinema"" paradigm.Because Coppola's vision of the narrative was constrained by Puzo's platform, he couldn't quite reach the summit -- that would be achieved in ""Part II""."

Michael (Pacino) is the youngest and wants nothing to do with the family business, but Sonny (Caan) is easily angered and flies off the handle a lot, especially when it involves the abuse of his sister Connie (Talia Shire). They have another brother named Fredo (John Casale), but he does not have the leadership ability of the other two.Seeing over all of this is the late great Marlon Brando as Don Corleone. He is father too all the Corleone children and is also known as the Godfather by everybody else. He wields the most power, but that power is tested by four other powerful families who are also vying for what the Don has. This leads too much deceit and murder as the leaders of the other four families look to unseat Don Corleone from the top.This movie is 175 minutes long. Usually when I watch a drama that long, I am unable to get through it. Not so with the Godfather. Francis Ford Coppola, who directed, manages to keep you're interest throughout. Yes the film moves at a leisurely pace, but it is never boring. His directing is helped greatly by the actors who give some of their greatest performances ever. Marlon Brando definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Actor.It is also interesting to watch how Pacino's character Michael changes as the film goes on through to the end.

Production Designer Dean Tavoularis team of Set Decorator Phillip smith and Art Director Warren Clymer give this film a rich look and an excellent period piece atmosphere along with Costume Designer Anna Hill Johnstone. Nino Rota's music score gives the film the flavor of a fine Italian wine. He scored all of Federico Fellini's films in Italy including La Vita Dolce and 8½ as well as scoring such films as La Strada, Obsession, War and Peace and Romeo and Juliet in his long career. This film also features great non-original music from Berlin to Bach and Mozart. Editor William Reynolds would have had quite an ambitious editing project with this three hour film and his skill paid off. The sequel Godfather II was a great film and one of the greatest and most recognized sequels in film history but I would have left it there and not made it a trilogy with Godfather III. I don't know how long this film has been #1 on the IMDb top 250 but it will likely be there in that spot for some time and it will take a film made after it to knock it out of the top spot. Maybe a film not yet made. I would give this a 10 and highly recommend it."

If there was a weakest link, though, it'd probably be Diane Keaton. She does bring an interesting quality to it, I agree, but it always looks like she's reading lines.

There is always something new you're discovering about it, each time you speak of it. The Godfather is one of those rare films.I was too young to see it once it came out, but I read alot of movie magazines at the time about it as well as grabbing a copy of the Mario Puzio book. My first full length view of ""The Godfather"" was on...yep, you guessed it, the ""Z"" channel in Los Angeles in the 1980's. It grabbed me and never let go.The Godfather has everything in it that a movie going public would like to see, and the rare thing is -- it's all in one movie. It deals with family, the relationship of sons and their placement IN a family, it has violence -- that's for sure, mystery, romance, corruption, suspense. It has a story, surprises. The costumes are wonderful, the scenery and sets are wonderful.This was 1972 and NOTHING like this was put together/filmed at the time. The early 70's gave alot of film makers chances, some good, some spectacular -- and most of all a legend for future film makers and entertainers to look at, hold in esteem and copy (which is the best form of flattery.)Don't get me wrong, there are many 'gangster-type' films out there that kick-butt (thanks to James Cagney, Edward G. and a host of others) , but this one...flowed.

Michael's ""transformation"" is the focal point of the movie, yet we see almost nothing of him in the first third of the movie and we can't really tell how much of an internal change he makes.  Leaving a little mystery and leaving things up to interpretation is fine but I thought this was a bit extreme.Second, the female characters were one-dimensional, naive and passive to the point of incredulity.

The rest of the cast is excellent as well, especially Pacino), the technical sides (the way Gordon Willis uses light and dark to contrasts the two sides of the Corleones made me pay attention to cinemotography), dialogue (""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli"") - and leave you completely satisfied.

The first two-thirds of the movie is definitely better, but the last third does its job in finalizing Mike's evolution into a Mafia chief.The movie adds to the mystique of Brando as Godfather by not having him the center of action except for the first third of the movie, keeping you from that overdone feeling, and his major decisions are made in the wedding and shortly thereafter.  But oh, the classic scenes that resulted:  the friendship scene with Bonasera, the ""making an offer that he can't refuse"" line, the horse's head, the hand stabbing/strangling death of Luca Brasi. In the minority situation for an actor's being made to look older than he is, Brando is superb.  The cotton stuffing in his mouth works magnificently. He is The Godfather all the way -- way, way over Michael.  His wisdom and counsel are greater, and his majesty; Michael is a morose figure.Sonny is a formidable, memorable character (is he not much taller than James Caan is?), and his blatant id contrasts with Vito and Michael.  Tom Hagen is also played very well, by Robert Duvall, and other actors and actresses do a good job.  The hypocrisy crystallized by the Catholic mass setting is also excellent.  And hey, is not Sonny beating up his brother in law one of the very, very best fight scenes, even if one-sided?  What can I cite by comparison, Bruce Lee vs. Chuck Norris in The Way of the Dragon -- and yes, not sarcastically -- for what good fight scenes are so distinctive, intense and original, leaving such an imprint--what other very good fight scene also sticks out so much in one's mind over others?  You can't say, ""they're all the same"" for this one.  Sonny, like Vito and Mike, is part of American popular culture (well, I guess international, not to be chauvinistic).One of my friends, and perhaps yours, has said, ""I was rooting for the Corleones.""  As one who likes many thrillers, action and suspense movies, and crime dramas, but does not like the overly depressing subject matter and sleazy characters and sometimes tortuous, overcomplicated plots that characterize the mid-70s onward (Pulp Fiction, Grifters, etc.), I note that this is unfortunately a forerunner of these, altho not hard to follow.  But I think it was the Godfather Part II that really was the precursor, and II's quality pales in comparison to I's (I do not care what others think), and much more than other sequels.  Because the genius of The Godfather I was taking such sordid subject matter and making it so entertaining, so much a part of our consciousness, and leaving us with such positive feeling when we think about it.

This is one of those movies that just holds you in thrall from beginning to end, with no let up in interest or involvement - an amazing feat under any circumstance but almost unheard of for a three-hour movie! As such, it's interesting to compare this with more recent epic-length films of today. A couple years ago, on its 25th anniversary re-release I saw this in the theater on the same day I saw ""The English Patient"". The difference in the two films was just amazing. The English Patient wasn't bad or anything, it's just that it was way too long for the story it told; a good 90 minute-to-2 hour premise was padded out with gorgeous but pointless scenery, an unnecessary subplot, and a shooting and acting style which emphasized dragging things out just for their own sake. The Godfather, by comparison, crams every single minute of its running time with richness, characterization, intrigue, etc. - so much so that, for me, the film actually seems SHORTER than its running time would lead you to believe. There's so many movies that could learn from this - movies that want to be epic length to inflate the importance of their subjects, but just arent' interesting enough to hold us for that long. Many films are guilty here, from Titanic to The Talented Mr. Ripley, The Green Mile - even such ""great"" films as Lawrence of Arabia and (yes) Shindler's List use their lengths more as endurance tests (i.e. if you can't stay interested through the whole thing than you must be somehow boorish or unfeeling) and as proofs that the directors just became so enamored of their subjects that they couldn't bear to take anything out than as necessary for the telling of their stories. Sadly, I must say that, in my opinion, even The Godfather Part II falls victim to this tendancy - definitely one of the most overrated and unnecessary sequels of all time.But if you want to see the Corleones (and Francis Ford Coppola) when they were all at the top of their game and everything was just cooking, go back and watch this movie. Even after all the imitations, the rip-offs, the parodies and the cultural appropriations of lines like ""Make him an offer he can't refuse"" and ""He sleeps with the fishes"" to the point where the movie sometimes seems as entrenched (and as tired) as cliches like ""Mom, God and apple pie"" --- once you start watching all of that stuff flies out the window and you're amazed to learn that, wonderfully, this film has lost none of its edge or entertainment value in the nearly thirty years of its existence.(BTW Don't anyone get the idea that I am against the concept of long movies - some of my all time favorites besides The Godfather are Apocalypse Now, 2001:A Space Odyssey, The Deer Hunter, and Oliver Stone's Nixon.  It's just that, I believe, a film really has to justify that running time, because it so opens the door to pretension and indulgence.)"

Pacino is his usual genius self. The unfolding of these characters is a story of its own. The 4 Corleone brothers are all very different. Sonny, (wonderful performance by James Caan), the hot-headed, quick tempered man, Fredo, weak and powerless, goes to Vegas to set up business, only to be brought down my Michael. Michael, the most sensible, if not accepting of his family's business, he is the most likely successor of the title. Finally, Robert Duvall (a wonderful performance as well) , as Tom the lawyer and trusted counselor to the Corleone's.

I couldn't watch it at one go as it became too boring in the middle 2- Character development : There was no character development. I couldn't understand why Al pacino fell in love with the gal in Sicily spite of having a girlfriend and how shamelessly he came back to his x girlfriend after loosing his wife without giving any concrete explanation3- Editing: The entire trip to Sicily was unwanted and could be avoided to shorten the movie. There were many unnecesarly scenes in the movie4- Acting : Personally I don't think Marlon Brando was suitable for this movie. As for a gangster I would consider someone with a very high vocal. I don't feel he deserved the Oscar as he did nothing extra ordinaryThe Good:1- James Caan acting 2- Good start to the movie 3- Few good scenes here and there 4- Good acting by Al Pacino in the climaxFinal Verdict: Highly Overrated.

Undoubtedly, the worst scene of this movie is when that satanic little grandchild begs and whines until Vito agrees to play with him and Vito dies of a severe ashtma attack.

Let me give you a hint why the trilogy of Lord of the Rings is better than the Godfather trilogy. Godfather part III a big time loser!!!You don't even have to be a fanatic filmgoer to see and realize that. The movie was clumsy and boring to a point that it was almost clear to me that Coppola wanted desperately to make his trilogy without having a clue of what he was doing. That reminds me of another 80'ties character called George Lucas (see Star Wars-saga). Maybe Coppola was trying to take the quote from Alfred Hitchcock a bit too literally, when he said that style in film is to plagiarise yourself. Godfather III is a recollection of scenes we saw before in a different outfit, adding some cheap cosa nostra crap that did not work, like the fake set-up scene with the helicopter. This is the moment where by unbelievable coincidence the Godfather and Sonny's son came out without a scratch. This is not the same kind of realism I saw in I and II. While Return of the King is the climatic moment of the trilogy, Godfather III was its lowpoint.This is Hollywood wanting to sell tickets the cheap way, betting on a sure thing.  And what about the story? What is it? Financial corruption at the Vatican? It is nothing more than an expensive soap-opera. So what if he did it the traditional way. He should of realized that he had no good story.
It is not because the actors from the Godfather trilogy received Oscars for their performances and probably LOTR not is because the actors from the first trilogy did a better job than the others. It has nothing to do with it. The whole show is not about rewarding talent, but to uphold a tradition of celebrating those who are loyal to the spirit of Hollywood. LOTR has but conformed to one tradition, the one from Middle-Earth, in a galaxy far far from Hollywood.Let's not forget however to point out that Coppola is responsible for putting his daughter in the film who given us a stunning insight in how bad acting can be. Fortunately for her she has proven, she is much better off directing films. Even Pacino doesn't bring a good performance. While in Godfather II he brought us a believable and likeable anti-hero, while in part III he doesn't do anything else than shouting.There are unforgettable scenes in the Godfather trilogy. But so there are far better scenes in LOTR, and probably in a way future generations will get inspired in how to make a sensible symbiosis between technique and story, in the same spirit of Hitchcock and Welles, who both were neglected by The Academy of Motion Pictures. If you talk about memorable scenes, look at how Peter Jackson brought us Gollem. It brakes again new boundaries for visual effects and surpasses even the matrix by far. Phantasy has never been that real since ever. And the examples could go on and on.Part III doesn't bring anything new, while LOTR innovate at every turn. LOTR is not the typical Hollywood film. In fact, it is not a Hollywood film at all. But It is a pure refreshing experience and a great motivation for a lot of young filmmakers."

But the fact that statistically it has been rated so high shows you about the sad and devious nature of people. I, for one, have rated at least 200 movies higher than The Godfather, and I am proud of it, because I cannot convince myself that a film which tells you the story of people with the lowest possible moral can be one of the best I've seen.

But, of course, events conspire to suck Michael in - and to keep sucking him in right through Godfather III - the assassination attempt on his father, Michael's coolly murderous response, the car bomb meant for him that kills his first wife, the Sicilian beauty Apollonia (aptly named for the god of sun light), the riddled body of his brother Sonny. Inevitably, a morally darkened Michael emerges at the end of the film, one who outdoes his father in guile and ruthlessness and whose final brutal and deceitful acts in Godfather I seal his doom as a Macbeth-like villainous tragic hero its really good"

People even consider this the greatest film of all time which makes me scratch my head because the second one is far superior. With that being said, what makes this movie is Marlon Brando's Performance. Evan though he considered to young for the Role of Vito Corleone, he seems to pull it off without any effort. Al Pacino, Michael Corleone, also brings it in this film playing a Character that want to desperately avoid the criminal world that his family is involved in but is forced to get involved due to circumstances that I will not Spoil. The cast is this film is superb and they all play character that come across as real and fleshed out. You actually believe they are related to one another.

361,5840,False,0.10247001074929789,"There are some movies which cannot be reviewed. We can all have our opinions, but we cannot rate them. These are the movies which go beyond the ratings and awards. The Godfather (1 and 2) is one such movie(s). To give a rating to these two movies would be an insult to its creators and I am not making any attempt to do so. These are two legendary movies, each an epic, a magnum opus for all other 'Don' movies.Thus, I present here some of my views and scenes from the two movies that touched my heart.Right movie from the beginning of the movie, the music is haunting. It pulls you towards itself, like the fatal attraction of parvana to the shama. Marlon Brando is characteristic. There has never been another Don in history so charming, honorable and one who is also a true family man. A Don who respects his friends and never forgets a favor.The transformation of Al Pacino from the distant lad who says ""That's my father, Kate, not me"" to the emotional son beside his father in the hospital ensuring him ""I am with you now"" to ultimately the unprecedented words pronounced by him ""I am working for my father now"" underlines the storyline.Some of my favorite dialogues by the movie are: ""A man who doesn't spend time with his family, can never be a real man."" ""I never ask for a second favor when I have been refused the first."" ""Don't tell me you're innocent, because it exhausts my intelligence."" ""Don't ever take sides with anyone against your family."" ""Women and children can be careless but not men."" The distress look on Brandon's face when he finds out his war hero son is invariably pulled into the underworld business, the silent tears of acknowledgement when he hears the news of his other son's murder and simply says ""I want no acts of vengeance"" shows that some actors don't need big dialogues to act.The final stages between father and son are beautifully portrayed. A concerned father advising his son, the last person he thought would be his successor. And the dutiful son consoling his dad that ""We'll get there"".The music is not just background score but also underlines the essence of the movie. Attentions to details like the steady flow of water, chirping of the birds, are hard to ignore.The climax of the movie where he lies with so much conviction to his beloved wife completes the transformation of Al from a civilian to the head of the Corleone family."

It takes its subjects seriously, bestowing legitimacy upon the internecine power struggles of the Mafia normally reserved for classical themes in high art. The film's release initiated a period when American filmmakers dared to take themselves and their artistic ambitions seriously (perhaps too seriously).

Directors should give the freedom to the actor to deliver a character that has to come somewhere from within the actor himself.

382,5861,False,0.1439433237069255,"Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating"" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out"" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film."

The best possible visual outcome of the definite word 'Mafia' would be 'The Godfather'. From hearing the Italian accent to grasping the tone of underworld organized crime, this movie provides ground for the marvelous portrayal of seemingly oblivious to conceptualize.Aspects of filming criteria, this movie is a sure criterion. Lucidity of screenplay, exemplary art direction, spontaneous acting, portraits of frame after frame with artistry had made this movie a topmost exemplar in regard of film education. To enlighten the topic, the lucidity of acting deserves far more credit than it can be written in a compact overview. The picturization of Sicilian eccentricity had been executed with a great prowess. When legendary Marlon Brando appears with a simple yet kindling shot, the whole movie sets off to a placid smooth flow. Integration of great Al Pacino from the two distinctive prospectus, one is a must to be edged to the seat while pondering over the transformation of Michael Corleone. Story line combines us with the explicit overview of Sicilian uprising crime in America. But, what we get from the movie is the greater contradiction of human nature, genuine compulsion for setting higher in the hierarchy and ecstasy of human prudence for family. Along with the lecherous underworld personnel, we get the celestial depiction of a don who is resolute in decisions, morally high in his immoral activities, in total control of the kernel of power with expertise. As the inevitable occurs, the legacy passes and bewilders the framework highly. In spite of possible complexities we get the taste of a single man enthroning the summit. It serves us with the latent ambition of every man to taste the eternity, dignity and complexity. From the point of any aspect, this movie provides the perfect aura for any audience whether looking for cinematic excellence or compact perfection of intricate plot. From my point of view it deserves a straight 9 out of 10. I have not given 10 because of some redundant cross dissolves."

The younger generation is represented by the then fresh, exciting talents who remain respected names in their profession (Pacino, Robert Duvall, Caan, Diane Keaton).

Cynical characters under a humanized view maintains the essence of the work, no one is who is by chance, are the circumstances that define their choices, all for a greater good: the good of the family.

There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an exposé of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.That just advice from me, thank you."

I will try to explain for the following reasons: #1) There is a lot of hype involved because it is considered a true crime epic, well it's not even a true story or based upon one has anyone realized that? Yes , there is some elements which are relative to the crime world at the time, but no this does not do justice to the real crime families. It's not based on a true story in any way other than something like Inglorious Bastards would be, it only uses some real names and real ideas in our history.#2) The action and build up is very slow paced and makes it difficult to sit through without getting bored. The action crawls at a snails pace, it does not bother to cover the history behind how Brando's character came to be in the position of power he is in. For something with such a slow build up i am surprised they did not incorporate anything about the don and how he came to be. I am disappointed to be unable to connect with the don on any level, it is only assumed that he worked hard and is a respectable individual.#3) It does not fully capture the real danger and constant rush involved with living a dangerous life every day. It does not feel real. The first shooting scene looked bundled and strange, even unorganized. It did not look professional or scary. And second, they didn't bother to finish him off or plan this effectively it looked like an assassination attempt doomed to fail. Not to mention his bodyguard, might i add this is the DON the GODFATHER his bodyguard looked like a quivering mass of coward. For someone in such an esteemed and established position he should be able to pick more skilled bodyguards. His crony immediately broke down and cried, any true criminal knows that business comes first, avenge your boss, don't sit and cry. If i was his boss and still alive i would get up and shoot my henchmen in the face for being a chicken. Also the scene where Robert Duvall sneaks a horse head into the director's bed? Am i the only that fully can see how ridiculous that is, and the fact that it is also quite impossible? For you that don't know the movie, he gets welcomed into the directors house to discuss business, and like a sneaky petty con artist insults him behind his back and mutilates his prize horse and sticks it on top of his bed while he's sleeping. The reality of that is just crazy. First of all, a person does not become a godfather by employing low integrity sleaze balls into his direct office, that is not how the world works. Criminal organizations have a code of conduct as well, and need skilled and practical criminals to do their work, criminals who often maintain their own standard of rules and principles. If a criminal did that kind of bull he is gonna being embarrassment to his organization.#4)This film does not appeal to me as dark and epic, but family fun inaccurate to the brutality and hustle real gangsters encounter. It is a strange concept it is too long and way too inaccurate to reality.In conclusion, I Want to say as a hardcore fan of crime, and someone who has broken a few rules personally in my time I can say this does not accurately portray the genre. It is far too long and slow paced for me to sit through, i cant say that i have ever finished this from start to finish i tried twice now and don't see my self as being able to."
420,5899,False,0.10797035650994934,"A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits.Of the many themes which The Godfather touches upon, it is that of ""family"" which resonates the most. The film is based upon the novel by Mario Puzo (who co-wrote the screenplay) and many sub-plots were minimised or thrown away by director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola, himself an Italian American and family man. He knew that the only way to make Puzo's sprawling novel work on screen was to focus on the familial relationships within this crime story, whether it be father to son, brother to brother, or husband to wife. In this world blood is not only thicker than water, it is holy.Best for ever."
421,5900,False,0.08483969137287367,"Almost every person who sees Hollywood films has at least heard of The Godfather, it is considered by multiple sources as one of the best films ever made in history, many people have also claimed that this is the best film ever made. I am not sure if I agree with the latter point, but I can proudly say is that the Godfather is just a Grand masterpiece which not only a fan of the crime genre but anyone who likes movies in general can enjoy. Now this is a 1972 film some people say it has not aged well, I disagree that film is still entertaining to watch, the plot will still grasp your attention and you will still be on the edge of your seat. The main thing that this movie does different compared to the movies of today's generation that it moves at a very very slow pace not that it's a bad thing, back then almost all films did that, the minor scenes went on for quite long. I mean seriously has there even been a recent movie in which a party or wedding scene went on for over 10 minutes (unless the actual film was based upon it)? Now I will not take away from this movie because of of prolonged scenes because the movie still makes sure to progress its story slowly in such scenes to keep the viewer interested. However these scenes also make the movie go on for 3 hours which kind of hurts its replay value. But even if you watch the Godfather once you will simply be in awe of it's magnificent story, brilliant characters and perfect setting and environment. This film is also a very realistic portrayal of mobs in Italy during that time period. All actors bring the characters to life and very so into the characters that you will feel like they are the characters themselves rather than actual actors. The acting is simply among the best I have seen in any movie, not just from the lead Al Pacino and Marlon Brando but even the supporting characters like Sonny played by James Caan or Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall are fantastically portrayed. Even the minor and the female characters play their part to perfection. There is nothing really bad to say about the acting.The plot is about the Corleone family and how it tries to co-exist with the other mobs. The story is fantastic with many twists and turns throughout and will keep you engaged about what will happen next, the movie does not move rapidly fast but it moves at a very slow pace to allow the viewer to get a better idea of the characters and the plot. The ending is also fantastic and is a perfect example of character development.The soundtrack is also fantastic and fits all the scenes in the movie, the main theme of the film in particular still sounds awesome even to this very day. The movie also takes itself very seriously, it does not do comedy, apart from a very few and rare scenes, this film is very serious and rightfully so it deals with a very serious topic and the events that transpire throughout are very difficult, tragic and severe for this movie to be anything else. The film is violent but it is not what you see throughout 90% of the film, the violence which is there, serves its purpose and progresses the plot in a meaningful way.Apart from the pacing, I felt like this film was a little hard to understand sometimes without subtitles specially when the Italian language is spoken, we are still not completely clueless to what's actually going on but knowing what the characters are actually saying would have helped. But that is only a minor issue which does not take away from the overall film.In the end, I just want to say what has already been said many times, The Godfather one of the best films ever made in history and anyone who likes Hollywood cinema in general and still hasn't watched this masterpiece, should just watch this classic, this is Hollywood at it's very finest.Overall Rating: 10/10"
422,5901,False,0.03577238709630436,"Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, THE GODFATHER is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 30 years after its release. Nino Rota's score, the sumptuous set design, and Brando's raspy pseudo-whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory.The film possesses an operatic quality, yet it's more understated than it is flamboyant. It takes its subjects seriously, bestowing legitimacy upon the internecine power struggles of the Mafia normally reserved for classical themes in high art. The film's release initiated a period when American filmmakers dared to take themselves and their artistic ambitions seriously (perhaps too seriously). There is something deeply resonant in the film's treatment of filial piety, the need for respect, and our culture's abiding interest in the parallel moral universe of the Mafia."

Really depicts the real life happenings of the mostly glamorized life of crime bosses.Whats amazing is that there is a lot of life and sub-stories in the movie. The Godfather is not even the central character.The actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing.Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so ""The Godfather"" becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller.I love the decor it makes the film authenticate since its the decor you would expect from the 1940's. Its filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish-brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry."
424,5903,False,0.14803601235087938,"The Godfather is a great film made with gusto. Most of the participants are at their career best. Nina Rota's magnificent score and Francis Ford Coppola's direction tie things together very well. Al Pacino is the greatest performer of a top-shelf cast. The decision to cast him as Michael is a stroke of cinematic genius. (Supposedly, Marlon Brando threatened to quit if Pacino wasn't cast, and this tipped the scales in Pacino's favor.)Another diminutive actor playing Michael might have emulated James Cagney a bit, with bounce and swagger in his step. Pacino never seems worried about his physical stature; instead, his Michael is very articulate. Pacino and Brando are putting on a Method acting show; and their chemistry together is sublime.The Godfather foreshadows Michael's destiny exquisitely. For example, consider the hospital sequence. Michael enters a room looking for the detectives protecting his father and we hear the musical soundtrack repeating the number ""two."" Michael opens the hospital door to his father's room--and it is clearly marked with the number two. The association of the number two with Vito when Michael is present foreshadows the rise of Michael in the family business. (That is, Michael is #1.) In addition, the actor playing Enzo the baker (Gabriele Torrei) has a strong resemblance to Pacino. When Michael throws Enzo's carnations away (on the steps outside the hospital) this is another clue that Michael is destined to chuck away the lover boy side of him and rise in the underworld.Marlon Brando's performance is a lightning rod for criticism, praise and satire. It is difficult to imagine any other actor of his time portraying Don Vito with all the knowing looks and gestures that Brando makes. It is another brave portrayal from Brando.The conflict between brothers Sonny (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is well explored. Sonny is all testosterone and action while Tom Hagen is cautious and inexperienced in underworld affairs. Since Hagen is adopted, he is both an insider and an outsider. The audience needs him to help understand the Sicilian logic at play.Having seen The Godfather dozens of times, it is fun pointing out the implausibility with the story. For example, it seems very hard to believe that a brother-in-law, already having been savagely smacked around in public for hitting his wife, would beat her again knowing that his wife's hot-headed brother would chase after him without his bodyguards. How much could Carlo have been paid to willingly absorb the risk that his brother-in-law exercises usual caution?Another implausible is that Barzini is doing something in public the day of the Baptism. Forgetting that Baptisms usually occur on a Sunday, what happens to Michael if Barzini is staying at home that day?The Godfather has us rooting for Michael even as he descends into evil. The transformation that Michael makes is shared by the viewer; we are also joining a criminal conspiracy. It is a uniquely memorable and pleasurable ride."

There is just a few film makers out there that keep this true formula alive today and let's hope there is more to come. Coppola has yet to come back and delight us with more.

It is obviously overrated, but there's a reason it's like that.The Godfather is perfect in many ways. First of, the acting. This is one of a few films in which brings amazing performances from the entire cast. Marlon Brando as the Godfather is obviously solid gold. The then 47-year-old nails it as the title character and offers an iconic, unforgettable performance that will always remain one of the strongest performances in movie history. Al Pacino succeeds as the ""nice college boy"" that changes strongly throughout the film. James Caan and Robert Duvall come strong as supporting characters, as well as Richard Castellano, Al Lettieri and Diane Keaton.Francis Ford Coppola is one of the last great directors. His directing in The Godfather is brilliant and spectacular. The screenplay for the film is terrific. Many good and iconic lines, and great dialog. The music is beautiful. The main theme is bone chilling and the Love Theme is unique and a masterpiece.

The story line just takes you in great journey, from the naïve and idealist Michael to the cold and calculated killer he becomes when he takes charge of the family business. The loss, the gains, the falls, and victories of the Corleone's family, we can feel them as ours as well. We can see how the moral code changes from Don Vito Corleone's leadership, and Michael's way to handled business. Don Vito Corleone to my point of view who have not killed his daughter's husband, for him it was all about the family, and community. I think Michael's difference was that everything was giving to him, and he grew up in an environment of richness, where in Don Vito Corleone, he suffered poverty, and worked really hard to get that kind of power, and his number one motive was the well being of family and community. Michael not having this kind of life experiences took a decision that marked his life, and we as spectators could live and suffer with these characters.

429,5908,False,0.16813117842297393,"The aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son.The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Based on Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, the film stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning the years 1945 to 1955, centers on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while also chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando). The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema[3]and as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre.[4] Now ranked as the second greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute,[5] it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990.[6] The film was for a time the highest grossing picture ever made, and remains the box office leader for 1972. It won three Oscars that year: for Best Picture, for Best Actor (Brando) and in the category Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. Its nominations in seven other categories included Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. The success spawned two sequels: The Godfather Part II in 1974, and The Godfather Part III in 1990. On the day of his only daughter's wedding, Vito Corleone hears requests in his role as the Godfather, the Don of a New York crime family. Vito's youngest son, Michael, in a Marine Corps uniform, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the sprawling reception. Vito's godson Johnny Fontane, a popular singer, pleads for help in securing a coveted movie role, so Vito dispatches his fear, Tom Hagen, to the abrasive studio head, Jack Woltz, to secure the casting. Woltz is unmoved until the morning he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion. Shortly before Christmas 1945, drug baron Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo, backed by the Corleones' rivals, the Tattaglias, asks Vito for investment in the emerging drug trade and protection through his political connections. Vito disapproves of drug dealers, so he sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to spy on them. The family then receives two fish wrapped in Brasi's vest, imparting that he ""sleeps with the fishes"". An assassination attempt by Sollozzo's men lands Vito in the hospital, so his eldest son, Sonny, takes command. Sollozzo kidnaps Hagen to pressure Sonny to accept his deal. Michael thwarts a second assassination attempt on his father at the hospital, but is accosted by corrupt police captain McCluskey, who breaks his jaw; Sonny retaliates by having Tattaglia's son killed. Michael comes up with a plan to hit Sollozzo and McCluskey that his brother approves over Hagen's objections: on the pretext of settling the dispute, Michael lures the pair to a restaurant, retrieves a planted handgun and murders them. Despite a clampdown from the authorities, the Five Families erupt in open warfare and the brothers fear for their safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily, and Fredo Corleone is sheltered by associate Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks his brother-in-law Carlo on the street for abusing his sister Connie. When it happens again, Sonny speeds for her home but assassins ambush him at a highway toll booth and riddle him with submachine gun fire. Michael's time abroad has led to marriage to Apollonia Vitelli. Their euphoria is shattered when a car bomb intended for him takes her life. Vito, saddened to learn that, despite his hopes, Michael has become involved in the family business, decides to end the feuds. Believing that the Tattaglias were under orders of the now dominant Don Emilio Barzini, he promises, before the heads of the Five Families, to withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo revenge for Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home and over a year later marries Kay. With his father at the end of his career and his surviving brother too weak, Michael takes the reins of the family, promising his wife to make the business legitimate within five years. He allows rival families to pressure Corleone enterprises even as he plans to move family operations to Nevada and delegates New York business to members who stay behind. Hagen, upset when Michael replaces him with Vito, is mollified by the older man's reassurance about their long- range plans for him. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos, Greene derides the Corleones as a fading power. To add injury to insult, Michael sees Fredo falling under Greene's sway. Vito collapses and dies in his garden while playing with Michael's son, Anthony. At the funeral, Salvatore Tessio arranges a meeting between Michael and Don Barzini, signally his treachery as Vito had warned. The meeting is set for the same day as the christening of Connie's son, to whom Michael will stand as godfather. As the christening proceeds, Corleone assassins, acting on Michael's orders, murder the other New York dons and Moe Greene. Tessio is told that Michael is aware of his betrayal and taken off to his death. After Carlo is questioned by Michael on his involvement in setting up Sonny's murder and confesses he was contacted by Brazen, Peter Clemenza kills him with a wire garrote. Michael is confronted by Connie, who accuses him of having her husband killed. He denies killing Carlo when questioned by Kay, an answer she accepts. As Kay watches warily, Michael receives his capos, who address him as the new Don Corleone."

Then I realized how much dialogue I was missing without the subtitles on! Some characters, especially Brando/Don Corleone, is impossible to understand a majority of the time but he says lines that are extremely important in order to absorb all that is going on. I feel like I have finally seen the great movie everyone was talking about. It feels like that in order to view the symbolism within a film I need to understand nearly every line. And don't get me wrong, I love Vito as a character and the performance given is amazing, but he is too difficult to understand. The most comparable performance to Brando in Godfather is Christian Bale in The Dark Knight series. Both are stellar performances, but both have dialogue that is nearly impossible to decipher. As a final note, the actor that plays Fredo is not familiar to me, but he is really talented and very good at pretending to be a person I would hate in real life."
443,5922,False,0.13118239405190354,"We know from Gay Talese's book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn't all sunshine and roses. More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of ""The Godfather,"" which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.""The Godfather"" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old- fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.But Brando's performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whispery, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although ""The Godfather"" is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn't time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he'll have to cancel his day at the races).The success of ""The Godfather"" as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garrotings.Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so ""The Godfather"" becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they'd tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn't have worked. But it's uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish-brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other."

Though Al Pacino had other great movies prior to this, Brando obviously took a shine to him and really mentored this actor in ways I believe no one can imagine. Pacino evolved and solidified the role of the head of the family that I believe is still being used in references today. A strong but loving Father figure, ruthless and forceful at times, Pacino drew on his personal background greatly during this role.James Caan was spot on as Sonny. The typical view of Italian temper as well as showing the eagerness to make a dollar. This role was the glue in the first half of the film. Talia Shire, just too good. What can one write about a flawless performance. The quintessential bad Italian daughter, awful wife and terrible sister. Scorned by her brother, bitter in the end of this movie, Mrs. Shire is wonderful in portraying the suppressed spirit of the true Italian mob family member.John Cazale is a piece of work. As Fredo, he embodies the mob family's image of the family member ""you should have just given money to instead of letting him in the business"". What a smart role for a great actor. Through it all Fredo was the one family member that was actually true to himself the whole time. He loved his family dearly, wanted to earn money, and absolutely craved respect. I love how he was always like the lamb in the lions den no one worried too much about. The movie was tailored such that if one thinks about it, the family is the one that let Fredo down by not recognizing his inherent shortcomings.Robert Duvall is a Master Counselor in the movie, but most the important contribution Duvall made was as an outsider. Not an Italian. His portrayal as someone who could be loyal and not blood Italian was huge in the USA at this time. I believe Duvall's role made it almost OK for races to interact with each other better without using side glances. This is a great testament to Duvall and one I don't believe was intended by the director or screenplay.Finally there is Mr. Marlo Brando. There's nothing to say but marvelous, magnificent, platinum performance."

It really feels as Coppola had some inside informant give him insight on how things work in a mafia family.

The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons.

His transformation, both by action and his psyche, is a treat to watch.

One can almost feel bad for Brando's 'Vito Corleone'. He is displayed as an old man who loves his family and will do anything to make sure they thrive rather than a ruthless killing machine. There is violence, but it's not over-the-top gore. It's all done in good taste. I found this movie to be very interesting because I know next-to-nothing about the Mafia. True, this movie is long at almost 3 hours but it's worth it. Now, to mention the music. I thought the music was truly beautiful and timeless. It perfectly captures the essence of the movie. . I've had the theme song stuck in my head for days now. At times my heart was beating fast for the characters out of suspense. I cried when they cried. I really felt some of the deaths.

A few days ago i had to watch it, the whole movie, 3 hours. At first i was thinking ""oh sh*t"", but i just had to get it over with. The performance of these two as i saw as main characters, Marlon and Pacino delivers an outstanding performance in adjusting to their characters battles as well in handling their emotions progressively. If we focus on Marlon his character i believe not many people could pull off, you can see that he really is stuck in this character, he looks worried constantly and troubled but at the same time a bit calm and bitter. His accent make's him even more interesting and the way he talks jagged tone. If we take a look at Pacino's role, I'd say this is irreplaceable as well, from the beginning who is a bit innocent and tries to not get involved, but the exceptional we see further on about his character evolves to this emotionless devil. What is so fascinating about this movie is how one person behavior is changing as the person itself goes through violence, sorrow and grief, what these situations turns a person in something he least wanted in this world. But as he goes through it, it becomes like nature to him, it's like it was in his veins from the start, he just needed it the keep spreading like a disease throughout his system. This is what is so bizarre until the very end, to wonder how he got so emotionless. I've never liked movies that were all about the Mafia, because i've never liked their motives.

The colours drip, rich and heavy. The characters hold up a mirror to our psyche, and the dialogue has rightly cemented ""The Godfather"" as a movie which will always have a relevance. Ironically, this tale of counter-culture has become arguably the definitive Pop Culture statement. ""The Godfather"" IS the gap between Mainstream and Art. It is the scale to which every ""classic"" must compare itself, and inevitably fall short. Concise Coalescence: ""The Godfather"" is the greatest Movie ever made. But that's not why I LOVE it. Sure, I respect a whole bunch of Films. I can recognise a Film's influence, award it its dues, and move on. But I keep coming back to this, because I feel an affection for it. Every time I hear that sweeping Niño Rota score, I'm reminded: this changed my life! Days spent dreaming of my future as either a Mafioso or a Film-maker. To a degree, ""The Godfather's"" reputation does it a disservice; this isn't a Movie to admire, it's a Movie to FEEL.

I love ""The Godfather"" because it never becomes cute or cuddly. I've just waxed lyrical about it, but as I sit to watch it, it's still dark, it's intimidating.

482,5961,False,0.0,"Here's how the arguments go for liking this movie go: The Godfather is a great movie because it's a hallmark of the genre. While gangster movies before this had been wall-to-wall violence and only loosely strung together by a plot, The Godfather was able to move away from that tradition by having a plot-heavy mobster movie. The performances were all superb and the characters all felt real.However, what this argument fails to recognize is that the plot moves at such a slow pace that it's difficult to give a damn about it. This is quite honestly the slowest paced movie I've ever seen, and it would have been improved a thousand-fold if an hour or so had been cut. It's not that I hate slow movies--a slow pacing can work brilliantly--but The Godfather? No, it doesn't do it.As for the cast and performances, they're really not all they're cracked up to be. If indecipherable mumbling is your thing, so be it, and in that case, this movie is the best thing ever. In reality, though, half-mumbled lines don't really do anything for me, and because of that; all the characters seemed to be fairly one-dimensional as a result.I can see how you could like this movie. On a technical level, it did move away from the traditional three-point lighting which was common in earlier films, and the plot was definitely something other than what had been dealt with in mobster movies before then. But the content of the plot was somewhat devoid of any real interest--or at least it was for me--and the characters came off as being one-dimensional as a result."

486,5965,False,0.1050990744507777,"Now, let's take a look at what anyone who is serious about film says is the greatest of all time. They're right. Both Godfathers stand alone as the two of the best scripted, acted, and directed films of all time. In all, they come out to the two best films. If you read some of my other reviews, you'll find that I consider a saga one film. A saga is best watched simultaneously. The Godfathers are a perfect example of how a series can get it right. Except the third. The third was just plain bad. Did Coppola really need to do this? Throw in another addition to the greatest saga in history? Sure, Andy Garcia was pretty spot-on as Sonny's illegitimate child. But they might as well have had someone like Dustin Hoffman play Michael, because he would've looked and sounded more like him than Pacino did at the time. And Sofia sucked. Good director, bad actress. It was not needed, because the first two were flawless. The ways of how this crime family rose, fell, rose, fell, etc., was perfect. I distinctly remember saying in one of my film classes (in front of a bunch of total film snobs) that Coppola is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. The other students stared at me with blank looks on their faces, as if I had told some horribly offensive jokes. Screw them. Why shouldn't he be considered? He deserves it, with The Godfather, Part II, Apocalypse Now, and The Conversation. Four classics. Did the other students not like it because he made a couple of flops (Jack, The Rainmaker)? All the best did (Kubrick-Eyes Wide Shut, Nolan-Insomnia), and they continue to be praised. I did enjoy The Outsiders, even if it doesn't come close to touching The Godfathers. Apart, they are masterpieces. Together, they are the definition of flawless filmmaking. The genius behind the storyline is that we never see the Don at his peak. We see him just before his peak, and just after as well. Everything, from the script to the directing, makes this storyline perfect. But it is the acting that has the biggest aspect on the story. Two actors (De Niro and Branda, both two-time winners) won for the role of Don Vito. Also, the surrounding cast of Pacino, Duvall, Caan, and Keaton, make the film what it is, attached to a pitch-perfect script by Mario Puzo and Coppola. to quote Richard Roeper, saying you like film but have never seen The Godfather is like ""saying you love to drink but you've never had water."" Too true."

The shooting of Vito and the assassination of Sonny maybe explains a psychological turn to revenge (a little material showing the attachment between Michael and each of them would have been nice), but it's not enough for this transformation into a full-fledged mafia manager, interested in brothels and casinos. The character of Kay is pathetic, living among criminals and believing Michael's promises about changing his way of life. The whole movie is a collection of excuses to present sketches of violence."
488,5967,False,0.1799550612908235,"It's hard to judge a film like 'The Godfather', especially for someone of my generation. Since its release in 1972, The Godfather has accrued a legendary status; it's difficult to watch a film that is often touted as the best of all time with an open mind and no preconceptions. However, after watching The Godfather many times and reading the novel on which it was based, it's clearly something very special. The film is a sprawling epic that rewards the viewer with a savagely twisting, multi- faceted plot. It's a mobsters' coming of age tale that's laced with tension, deception, tragedy, violence and death.Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is introduced on the day of his daughter's wedding, a very special day in Sicilian tradition where the father of the bride is to deny no man a special favour. The beneficiaries' utmost respect for the Don is illustrated in the opening scene, their displays of courtesy coming in the form of personal address and greeting rituals. The Don is a man of respect and principle, a man who puts emphasis on what's fair, denying to avenge, for example, a father's anguish over the rape of his daughter by means of murder  'That is not justice; your daughter's still alive'.In other circles however; the Don is not so respected. Vito Corleone is an old fashioned Don, what is referred to as a 'Moustache Pete'; he is reluctant to delve into the business of drugs, unlike the contemporaries from the rival New York crime families. The Don's refusal turns the relationship between the Corleones and many of the other families sour. It is how the ensuing violence is regarded as just 'business' that is the cold, harsh danger of the film. Its depiction of violence is visceral and often occurs when not expected. Rather quickly, the Corleone criminal empire falls apart; the next generation having to revitalise the family and reclaim their place at the top of the five families.The film is probably the most perfectly cast in history. The primary characters of Vito (Marlon Brando), Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Fredo (John Cazale), Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) and Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) are all expertly interpreted from Mario Puzo's magnum opus. The scores of supporting actors are also without fault. After reading the novel, it's remarkable how faithfully envisioned the characters are in the film, which is thanks to a combination of uncanny physicality and astute interpretation.The Godfather is a brilliant adaptation of Mario Puzo's masterfully told story; the 1969 novel was written with such an authenticity that it almost seems like non-fiction in certain passages. I think it's true that when one thinks of a gangster, they picture the omnipotent Vito Corleone sitting back in his chair, his glum face contemplating with that infinite sagacity and authority.The Godfather is a true spectacle in both mediums; deciding which is best is a difficult task. The only aspect that I felt was stronger in the book was character development. The character of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is given greater depth in the novel; Michael's transcendence seeming comparatively abrupt in the celluloid interpretation. The character of Luca Brasi is abundantly more powerful in the book, whom whilst is an ally of the Corleone family, is penned as an ominous villain with a dark, brutal secret. The film, meanwhile, essentially depicts Brasi as an oaf. This depiction is understandable, Brasi is an old-timer who is firmly within a closing chapter of the Corleone family, however I was surprised by how markedly less intimidating a figure he was. Additionally, many of the supporting characters are also given interesting back stories by Puzo, notably Captain McCluskey. Of course, that level of intricacy is possible in a novel, while a film could easily become bloated with such detailing.Ultimately, 'The Godfather' is a film made by a highly talented crew who combined the seminal prose of a skilled author with brilliant direction, perfect performances, effective cinematography and the utterly beautiful, iconic music of Nino Rota and Carlo Savina to produce one of the best, well rounded and moving films ever made. It is a film that is wholly deserving of the term 'required viewing'."

As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet.

Each character is exactly as you imagine them to look and act in the book and this movie is one of the few movies where it is actually as good or even better than the book.The only negative I can find about this movie is that it is abit of an unrealistic take on the Mafia and glorifies them more than what they were. As the movie shows them being very close like a family even the ones that aren't related, but in actual fact it would be best friends killing each other in the mafia as seen in movies such as Goodfellas or Donnie Brasco.

But this movie isn't; it's supposed to be a movie about a family which just so happens to be in the mafia.I have never met anyone that has not liked this movie and most people put it up there with the best.

An excellent screenplay, excellent actors and excellent cinematography makes this one of the best films ever produced and its not hard to see why. The film stars Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone aka ""The Godfather"", Al Pacino as The Godfather's son Michael, James Caan as Sonny who is The Godfather's eldest son and heir apparent, John Cazale as Fredo, the ""innocent"" son of Vito Corleone, Talia Shire as Connie the daughter and last but not least Robert Duvall as ""Tom Hagen"" as the adviser to the Don. The rest of the supporting cast is outstanding as well.The screenplay is faithful to the storyline of the book, which excludes some chapters from the novel, however this doesn't diminish the movie in anyway. It is a story, ultimately a tragic one, about the powerful Corleone Family and the internal strife, struggle, loyalty and love mixed in with a need for power ultimately makes victims of all members of the family. I am sure all who have seen the movie know the plot well, and for those who haven't seen the movie, I wont spoil any of it, since it is a movie ""you cant refuse"" to see. The ultimate lesson of the movie in my opinion is ""Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely"".The characters in the movie are supposedly based on real life Mafioso's such as real Gambino crime boss Sam ""Boom Boom"" Giancana is the inspiration for Vito Corleone and Johnny Fontaine is based on Frank Sinatra as it will be easy to see when the viewer watches the movie.This is a true classic in every sense of the word and I can't recommend it highly enough for those who enjoy classic movies and movies that last throughout time.

He knew that the only way to make Puzo's sprawling novel work on screen was to focus on the familial relationships within this crime story, whether it be father to son, brother to brother, or husband to wife. In this world blood is not only thicker than water, it is holy.Coppola opens the films with an interesting shot of a pitch black screen giving way to a desperate figure, an undertaker pleading to Mafioso patriarch Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) to revenge the savage beating of his daughter. It is the wedding day of the lone Corleone daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request, which Don Vito takes on with reason, while also subtlety enforcing his position as a man to be respected and feared.Brando's casting was a coup for Coppola, for three reasons. First, it exhibited the brilliance and innovation of Brando's thespian prowess, creating a wholly new mafia figure within a world of stereotype. Second, it re-established Brando's standing as a major player after years of being labeled ""box-office poison"". And third, it points to Brando's influence as ""godfather"" to a generation of actors, many which play his children in this film.Plot wise, The Godfather begins with the attempted assassination of Don Vito from a rival crime family unhappy with his refusal to enter the narcotics trade. With the Don temporarily out of the picture, it is up to his sons to run the Corleone clan. There is hot tempered Sonny (James Caan), meek mild Fredo (John Cazale), adopted son of Irish ancestry Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and the fiercely independent Michael (Al Pacino).It would be Michael who comes through as successor, and as a result The Godfather is as much Pacino's film as it is Brando's, introducing himself with a revelation of a performance."

The acting is phenomenal, with Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan and John Cazale all putting forward Oscar worthy performances.The story is brilliant, director Francis Ford Coppola really put a lot of thought into this and the way the story is shown, it never loses interest, even though the film is two and a half hours long. If you stay focused, you stay amazed. If the acting and plot weren't good enough, be prepared to be blown away by the classic theme for this movie, the way it is put into the scenes really adds to he grand stature of the movie.It's a 10/10 and a definite watch for movie lovers with a good taste."

I don't know why he did not awarded an academy award for his portrayal of Michael . That's why i don't like academy awards. Tom Hagen is also very good. I liked the way Coppola directed it,as a lengthy movie i never get bored. I also watched THE GODFATHER part2, also a great movie and THE GODFATHER part3,which was not so bad as many says.

499,5978,False,0.09252601218020905,"Steven Spielberg once said he considered retiring after watching The Godfather. Stanley Kubrick admitted The Godfather may very well be the greatest movie ever made and without a doubt has the best cast. If two of the greatest directors of all time had claimed such statement, what more needs to be said about this masterpiece, really? By now, it's already a stuff of legend. Countless lists and people have rated this as the finest motion picture to ever grace the silver screen. The genre and cinema itself have been heavily influenced by the contents in the movie, and even real-life mafias mimicked how Don Vito Corleone, portrayed by Marlon Brando in what I consider to be the most splendid acting job done by any actor or actress in any movie ever, carried himself. When did you ever hear something like that happened? If there was ever any? I doubt Francis Ford Coppola himself would have thought his first big directorial job would have given birth to an enduring legacy THIS big. Sure, he had Marlon Brando in his pocket, complete with Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, James Caan, and Robert Duvall as future stars just to name a few, which must have been exciting for a young director for that time. But I still doubt Coppola would have known he was directing the greatest motion picture of the 20th century even once during the entire 62 days of shooting, even when he, the entire casts, and the entire crews gave it their all for those 62 days. But that magic was there. And it is now known throughout the world as The Godfather.I think the story is rather famous now, but I'll say it anyway. It tells the story of an organized crime family after the World War II was over. Spanning over 10 years, the movie was a journey of the youngest son (played brilliantly by the legendary Al Pacino) transformed from a war hero not wanting to have anything to do with his family's business to become the next head of an organized crime dynasty.It featured brilliant performances from every single person involved, especially the mythical Marlon Brando. Every scene he was in, no way you didn't have your eyes on him. Even when he wasn't around, you would still feel his presence and power. His character, to me at least, made this movie. No one could play him as grand as Marlon Brando did.On technical aspect, this movie is flawless. Coppola's directing really captured the quintessence of every character in the movie. The dark photography added to the whole mystique of every scene in this movie. And the last but definitely not the least, the score is magical.What else is there need to be said about this masterpiece? Only a few movie can be called perfection, The Godfather is a prime example of it. Everything in this movie is so unbelievably perfect it is almost unreal. How come something became this great is hard to decipher. This timeless classic is a definite must see for anyone. And among many movies made in the 20th century I have seen, this is the best of the best. The finest of the finest. Maybe several movies can come close, but I don't think anything can top this. I firmly believe The Godfather is without a doubt the most brilliant motion picture of the 20th century."

The cast is Probably the best iv'e ever seen,which includes Brando,Pacino,Duvall,Caan,Keaton and many,many other great actors/actresses.The screenplay is very faithful to the book,proving adaptations can be perfect.Most of all the story itself,which for me never get boring to watch.Their really isn't a straight path story here,we have a movie that represents life in the 1940's as the crime families from each district confront their differences leading to a bunch of events that i won't get into. Overall this movie amazes me every time and iv'e seen at least a dozen times,each time better than the last.

Francis Ford Coppola knew how to adapt Mario Puzo's ""The Godfather"" with infinite, unquestionable and miraculous perfection! Anyone who has watched the film isn't just watching it-they're living it! We feel the bursts of the Don Corleone's (Marlon Brando) fiery, we tear at his beautifully philosophically spoken dialogue, and we feel the immense power and influence his character possesses...Al Pacino as Michael Corleone also holds us in with infinite gravity that we cannot resist nor rebel against. He moves, we watch. He speaks, we listen--all while being mesmerized at his unfortunate, yet incredible transition from the beginning and end of the filmI highly commend Coppola's direction; the man knew his job extremely well, and so whatever one sees within this film isn't a millisecond wasted.

Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for?

Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life.

This movie shows the revenge, greed, and betrayal, between the Corleones and the mafia. Marlon Brando does a superb job playing the godfather who is the leader of the mafia, or Vito as they call him. His character gives one insight to what the mafia really is about and the business deals among them. Other actors such as Al Pacino and James Caan also portray their characters Michael and Sonny as the sons of the godfather very well too. Michael at the beginning of the movie has no interest in being involved in the mafia and by the end he has taken over the family business. People get to see first hand the transformation of these characters from beginning to the end of the movie. The story line makes this movie much more fascinating yet harder to follow than your average movie. Each scene that takes place in the movie is essential to understanding and delving in even deeper into the history of the Corleones and their involvement with the mafia. The great acting, excellent dialogue, and an ever-changing plot is what sets this movie apart from the rest. I recommend this movie to any movie fanatic. The Godfather is more aimed towards older teens and adults because of the complicated storyline and the violence shown."
507,5986,False,0.07157982500781518,"The Godfather is one of maybe 3 or 4 of those 'perfect movies'. The ones where no matter how many times you watch it, you can't nit-pick anything wrong, unnecessary, even if your life depended on it. It has an amazing story, incredible (and subtle) acting, great cast overall, and it is consistently gripping for the 3-hour run time. There is no trace of any laziness or mistake.So why shouldn't I give this a perfect rating while we're at it? Well, two reasons mainly.The first is universal: Despite it's Cinematic perfection, the way I see a perfect movie is if no one hated it. If ANY human being watched this movie from start to finish, they would be on the edge of their seat for 178 minutes (and I mean ANYONE who watched this, not one person left behind). It seems a little like splitting hairs if one person would lean back for a second and no longer calling this movie 'perfect', but when I hear that word, I expect people to mean what they say. And judging from the few hateful reviews I've seen on this one, it just doesn't quite make the cut.Second, I would be one of those people who happened to sit back for a portion of the movie, mostly after Don Vito came back from the gunshot scene. I was thrilled and angry at the same time, but seeing as how he went on with business as before, I figured it was a break in the movie for everyone to re-cap so far. Bottom line, I got lost a little after that.Again, if the Godfather were perfect, then it would have a prefect 10/10 overall rating as well, and not the 9.2 it currently has. Still, I recommend anyone who likes movies to watch this one. It will most likely be worth your while."

His use of light and music is superb. His framing makes the atmosphere intimate and believable. This movie is laced with iconic scenes, has great pacing and is blessed with great production values throughout. Wow.The bad: Brando is a joke (as he often is). Also, I didn't think the storytelling was particularly tight; you could find more holes in the plot than in Sonny C's body.

512,5991,False,0.11053350423840631,"In cinema, there are few films that can, at all, be considered either great, and fewer that can be considered perfect. Mario Puzo's The Godfather is one of those films that is perfect. Being based of off the best seller by Mario Puzo, director Francis Ford Coppola creates one of the most accurate portrayals of an Italian crime family. When most people think about films that deal with the Mafia, Italian gangsters, what they think about is people that ship drugs, deal with prostitution, and above all else, just fight others for the hell of it. But, what makes The Godfather so different is that, contrary to the rather dark, violent nature of the film, this movie destroys all stereo types as it becomes a film that is not, at all, about running a crime family. This film is REALLY about a father trying to pass his legacy and empire to one of his sons and that one son having to come to terms with his own legacy and the choices he makes. When Mario Puzo decided to originally write the novel that this film is based on, he did it only for the money and nothing else. But what he did not expect was to have his entire creation take a complete life of it's own in a way that only few people can imagine. Even more so was the shock of how well this film did. Want a little taste of how well this film did? Before the film was even released, The Godfather Part II was already in development. But, more on that later. Now, my complete reaction to watching this film. To say that this is one of my personal favorite films of all time would be something of a drastic understatement. With me, there are some films that you like and some that change your life. This is one of those films that changes your life with each and every viewing. When I first sat down and watched this film, I remember feeling complete once the credits started to role. I know that sounds cheap, but it is true. Everything from the story to they way Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is in this film, it just spoke to me in a way that very few films can ever do. And I am not the only one that felt this way. There is a magic in this movie that can never be paralleled and the closes that we get (and one that is pretty damn close at that) is the sequel that is said to be equal to better then this film. But more on that later. Let's get down to the details. With direction, Coppola does wonders. He keeps the story moving, never dragging behind, and keeps making you interested with the look of the film. While some have complained about the lighting used as being too dark of a film or too gold, I say that the use of that is, quite fantastic. The reason why is because it always sets the mood for the scene and the tone that you will end up feeling. Plus, little added in items like the use of oranges in some scenes give this film a little kick by letting the audience know that something is about to go down. For the direction, Coppola, you do wonders. And the Academy Award for Best Direction was well won and deserved. Now the acting. Oh, my God. What can I say? Well, let's think. Marlon Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor and Al Pacino won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Need I say more? Okay, I will talk about the supporting cast. With huge names like Richard Dreyfus, James Caan, Abe Vigoda, and Diane Keaton, this film is filled with some of the greatest talent that money can buy. But what shocks me the most is that they treat this film with such a tone of seriousness that they literally stop becoming themselves and become these incredible people. Next the score. Like so many classic films, this film's score is something of a staple in film history. Mostly due to the famous 'The Godfather Waltz', Nina Rota became a household name in the music world due to the simplicity of that piece. It was simple, yet set the tone perfectly. The only crime that has ever been done on this film was the score not being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score. Oh well. Later on, this film saga will get it's award. Finally the script. Being adapted from the novel by Mario Puzo, and being written by him and Coppola, this film mirrors the novel so closely that you would only have to read the novel to know more about the extra characters that are not THAT huge. The dialogue is authentic, honest, and bold as this well written script is presented. The Academy Award for Best adapted Screen play was also well deserved. Overall, this entire film is worthy of the magnitude that it has gotten, the awards it has won (including Best Film), and the hearts and souls it has touched. Easily one of the greatest films ever made."

As far as it goes, The Godfather is literature for movie-goers and respectfulness for critics. It boasts legendary performances, excellent direction, a brilliant script, and a smooth, peaceful soundtrack.This film wouldn't have been this good if not for Marlon Brando's absolutely amazing performances as Don Vito Corleone. His character has gone down in history as one of the most sophisticated, yet graceful characters of Cinema. Brando is widely known today as the greatest actor that's ever lived. Al Pacino, is brilliant, if not perfect in this film. He plays Michael Corleone with a certain innocence, yet jealousy for all he's worth. This actor is also known as one of the best actors in the world. You would have to also thank an excellent supporting cast that includes people like Diane Keaton, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Sterling Hayden.Francis Ford Coppola's direction is trustworthy and often rewarding, as he leads this film in the right direction. The sets and scenery are often beautiful and intriguing, which matches the silent tone of this film. Since this is set in very old periodic places, this is a great example of old New York and Italy. The greatest scene in this film involves only Brando and Corleone. It's a scene of such scope and emotions that it's hard to describe it.Even though this material is based on Mario Puzo's wonderful books, it's hard to notice it. The film is so fluent and straightforward, that it's hard to pick up any flaws or evident mistakes in this. The writing is nevertheless excellent and even though there's no narration, this film never leaves you bored.And last, the soundtrack by Nino Rota is quite something. It's a very smooth, soothing soundtrack that is based on Italian music. This is very original and never leaves you disappointed with itself.Overall, there's no doubt this is an examination of American classical Cinema.

This movie was one big slumber-fest and there wasn't enough boobs!But what truly made me come to this decision was discovering the pile of popcorn and butter vomit that came from my mouth onto my smart phone's IMDb application, after revisiting this so called winner of ""Best Picture,"" ""Best Actor,"" and ""Best Adapted Screenplay."" Critics of Coppola's uncreative, cookie-cutter, three hour long cheep film cheated and lied to the American population. Make no mistake, this ""Italian"" cultured film is worse than a serving of stuffed calamari in tomato sauce with no garlic, rotten eggs, and a pregnant squid pulled out of the Sarno River. For the those of you spent time to even explore the other two parts of the story, I apologize. When I eventually got up from my imitation leather lazy-boy for a bathroom break all that came out was Marlon Brando's crappy performance. Not to mention Diane Keaton ""expanding"" her acting career... should of stayed with Woody. I feel this movie was pretentious and belittled the American audience. Even Italian film theorist Jean Epstein would probably say, this movie was about as sincere as using Ragu in spaghetti. For my own taste, I'm going to stick with the true mob classics like Corky Romano and Mobsters (with the truly talented Christian Slater). Thanks for the waste of time Francis Ford Coppola!"

Although it's one of those movies where you really had to pay attention, or usually you have to watch it twice to understand everything that is going on.

It was also very fitting with the movie.Cinematography and effects. The filming was decent. The movie kept a nice balance between dialogue and action scenes, and the action scenes were in very good taste (meaning they weren't ""over-done"" with gallons of fake blood and/ or over-exaggerated pain).

If I didn't know this was a movie I would think that someone had recorded an actual person's life.The action. I won't deny it, I love action and this movie does not fail. The fight scenes were epic and unpredictable. One moment a family could be sitting down to a nice dinner and the next minute machine gun fire could be going everywhere. My personal favorite was when Emilio Barzini was shot and rolled down the stairs.This is a movie that I would recommend to anyone. This is one of the few movies that can please everyone. It has action, romance, comedy, drama, suspense, a deep plot, and a feeling of satisfaction after you see it. If you haven't seen this movie do so as soon as possible this is one film that you can't refuse."

The film is very long but it didn't bother me and it certainly isn't boring like some people have said. Much of the length is caused because Coppola put great care into making his characters seem ""real"".

554,6033,False,0.09142907733393643,"Words cannot describe the perfection that is The Godfather. It captivates you from the moment the wonderful and haunting score starts to play to the moment that the credits roll. Coupled with a wonderful script by the author of the book himself and the perfect cast of characters, this movie cannot be called anything other than perfect.It is a story of a Mafia crime family and how this identity affects those within it. It is a haunting story of love, betrayal, hatred, fear, and, most of all, family. As you watch this movie, you will find yourself wishing that this family was a reality, something you could see and talk to and join. The greatness of the Corleone family is summed up in Don Corleone's line, ""I refuse to be a fool, dancing on a string held by all those big shots.""Marlon Brando's performance stands out above all the others; his portrayal as Don of the Corleone Mafia family is so convincing that if you see him in his other films, you will find it hard to be convinced by his other characters. Al Pacino provided a wonderful portrayal of a family member outcast that is unwittingly drawn into the whirlwind of his family's business. Other performances by James Caan and Robert Duvall and all the others completed the greatest cast assembly in movie history.Though followed by two sequels, The Godfather was undoubtedly the greatest among them as well as being the greatest movie ever created. Citizen Kane may be regarded as higher, but it is the most important movie of all time, not the greatest; The Godfather holds that title. It is a pity that this movie won only three Academy Awards (Picture, Actor, Adapted Screenplay); it was right that it won Best Picture, but it was jipped out of all the other awards it should have won, especially Best Director, by Cabaret, a self-indulgent piece of crap with Liza Minneli as the star. But no matter what awards it won, The Godfather will stand the test of time and will forever be recognized as the greatest film ever created.100 out of 5"

He could add many dimensions to a given character /role by his own charismatic personality, demeanor and voice. People will never forget Stanley Kowalski of ""A street Car Named Desire"", Napoleon Bonaparte of ""Desiree"" and Christian Fletcher of ""The Mutiny on the Bounty"". He was definitely a living legend of his time, a towering personality over other contemporary actors.Mario Puso's Godfather owes a lot to Marlon Brando, who was shown as an aging patriarch (Don Vito Corleone) teaching tricks of the underworld ominous trade to his young cub,(Michael Corleone) portrayed by Al-Pacino. As the young role demanded, Al-Pacino's innocent face and if not simple, straight acting style was appropriate while the old man's (Brando's ) visage bore the complexities of life's bitter machinations that were required of him to get to the top rung of the clandestine Mafia Empire.It is beautifully directed while punctuating the cinematic sequence with retrospective details of the elder Corleone's youth. It takes the audience to the old times with a pensive setting that approaches the status quo/wealth and waste of American Underworld.Howsoever great the title and story of this movie as well the acting skills of Marlon Brando, but it cannot be regarded as the all time great movie EVER MADE. There is more to the Mafia and Underworld than meets the eye after watching this movie. The human intellect is endowed with exploring and implementing even more innovative ways of the negative side as one can imagine.Nevertheless, it is a good effort at revealing the gory and ruthless side of the criminal dark world."

He is the best in the whole movie next to Sonny and Vito Corleone. I like Michael because of the way he is with his father and also of his rise to the criminal empire.Sonny is another one of my favorites because he is tough and hard headed and how he defended his younger sister from her abusive husband Carlo Rizzi. But it is a bad thing what happens to him, it was something that angered me.Vito Corleone is also the best one in this movie and my favorite line of him in the movie is: ""I'm going to make him an offer he cannot refuse"".

If you do not want to see the perfection, see Scarface, Goodfellas, Once Upon a Time in America, and the other better mafia films, and leave Godfather to the end. It is easy to underrate other great films after watching Godfather.Francis Ford Coppola made a deep research before setting up the scenes, and discussed every single detail with Mario Puzo.

There is a feeling that he will come away with comments like ""It wasn't that great."" or ""That's supposed to be brilliant masterpiece."" Well, I am going to add some more into the hype machine, because the many other raves about The Godfather are true. It is a phenomenal motion picture that deserves its awards, praise and even more. Francis Ford Coppola constructed one of the shining works of the New Hollywood Era and due to the many spoofs that people produce, both in films, television and YouTube, it has stayed in the memories of countless film lovers. Much like Citizen Kane and Casablanca, a viewing of The Godfather is a must for any film aficionado.Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the most powerful mafia family in America. He is aided by his sons, timid Fredo (John Cazale), violent Sonny (James Caan) and the adopted family lawyer Tom Hagen (Robertt Duvall). His youngest, Michael (Al Pacino), has returned home from serving in the Second World War to attend the wedding of his sister (Talia Shire). Unlike his brothers, he wants nothing to do with the family business and prefers to go into in a clean profession. However, after Vito is shot and wounded, Michael's inner Corleone comes out and he decides to seek revenge on those responsible. He flees to Sicily after doing his job and when he returns, he becomes the new Godfather and one of most powerful men in the mob world.Every single aspect of The Godfather has been so praised and analysed by many historians and film critics that it will be difficult to construct an original review. Marlon Brando's performance is incredibly etched into our minds and for good reason as it stands as the pinnacle of this great actor's work on film. Newcomer Al Pacino also provided a stunning acting job, making Michael a fascinating character of the Godfather universe and his brilliant work continued to even greater heights in Part II. James Caan, John Cazale and Robert Duvall add more fantastic triumph to the ensemble with their impressive work as the other three Corleone brothers. It's incredibly insane watching their work knowing that Paramount Pictures did not want them for the parts. Coppola's direction and screenplay (which he co-wrote with the book's author Mario Puzo) are also the film's high points along with Nina Rota's brilliant musical score. The Godfather is a fantastic film experience and a masterpiece of cinema that will and can be viewed many times over."

I understand his amazing acting ability but i actually thought De Niro did a better job in Part 2. Pacino as Michael is one of the greatest performances in modern cinema.

It completely annihilates most of the movies of its time and even though it was made in the early 70's it is still better than most any movie that has come out since then. Powerful acting, powerful direction, perfect amount of violence and gore and one of the best stories ever written in my opinion. Sheer brilliance. A stunning masterpiece. One of Al Pacino's best and its an understatement to say that he has a LOT of stellar performances. With an all star cast and not a single bad scene in the entire film i'd have to say that this is one of those few ""perfect"" films. I have a hard time differentiating a favorite between the first and second movie in the trilogy, but if I absolutely had to it would probably be the first one. The third one was good but pales in comparison to the first two. I have seen very few movies in my day that can compare to this film.

During the movie, the audience really doesn't see much it can disapprove of. No women are involved in prostitution, no lives are being ended by compulsive gambling, and no theft rings. In fact, the only real person outside the mob who is corrupt is a police officer with a significant speaking role. Brando is great with many memorable and quotable lines, and Al Pacino's performance in comparison to Brando's shouldn't be ranked to much further behind.

Brando was regarded as poison: he was impossible to work with, causing movies to lose money with his outrageous demands, so the studio execs despised and distrusted him. This movie, for which he had to suffer the humiliation of auditioning, resurrected him. It opened the door to the memorable ""Last Tango in Paris.""

The Godfather story has weaved it's way into society slang, catch phrases and the average person's basic knowledge of the mafia.

The movie, the dialogue, the cinematography are as fresh today as in 1972. Pacino's portrayal of the character of Michael Corleone is film school homework.

It's one of those movies that you would always hear people talk about and wondered 'what's all the hype - could a movie that was made prior to your birth really be that great?' Well, at least that is what I wondered. I never understood the fascination with Al Pacino, well at least until I watched this film. When I first laid eyes and ears on the first one, I could not put it down. I must have watched it at least 10 times consecutively and just fell in love with it's powerful and captivating presence. There is a reason that this film is on the top of the IMDb Charts. All the pieces that make this film so brilliant somehow magically fell into place when this film was made. For such a great director such as Francis Ford Coppola to come across one of the 20th century's greatest novels - The Godfather was destiny. Francis knew to truly captivate mastermind he wouldn't go it alone for the script. Yes, he dove passionately into the project and a lot of the film's ideas were sparked and derived by initial interest. But being the fanatical director that Coppola was, he set sail to take the project into timeless space. To do this, he knew he had to include Mario Puzo (author of the Godfather book) in on the script. Even casting took Coppola by storm and he was in for much labored conflict and tough decisions in order to see out his vision. Hollywood being Hollywood and Paramount in it's scope originally rejected the idea of casting young and unrecognized actor Al Pacino to play the role of Michael. But Coppola knew better and thus fought hard to keep him in. Thank goodness because any other actor could not play such an untouchable role that only Al Pacino could fill; The makings of such a dynamic and powerful role. Marlon Brando was probably the sure-shot out of the whole cast and well, Marlon Brando certainly pulled through. For me, it's Marlon Brandon's lack of presence in the 2nd that makes the first topple the second. The beginning of Godfather one with Marlon Brandon as ""The Don"" Vito Corleone sitting at his desk addressing Bonasera's request before he steps out for his daughter's wedding is simply timeless. That powerful message which in it's own right from the film and in the book carries even deeper and more powerful messages in analogies and sub-meanings is delivered on a timeless measure that puts chills down your spine almost every time you watch it. That deeply rooted sub-context makes it tireless, restless and relentless enough where hearing it a billion times is not enough.

596,6075,False,0.16902491126323854,"It's amazing to think, having listened to Francis Ford Coppola's DVD commentary, that his 1972 epic The Godfather was produced under such incredible studio and financial pressure  one can only imagine what this picture could have been if Coppola was given a little more control. To this day, The Godfather remains a classic, truly extraordinary, and etched into the memories of all who've seen it. It is one of the most widely acclaimed and financially successful films of all time, consistently among the top film lists of most, and is my personal favourite motion picture.Set in 1940's New York, The Godfather tells the tale of the patriarch of a mafia organization, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando)  a man who commands enormous authority and power  and both his literal and figurative families. When the Don refuses a proposition by the drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo, believing that narcotics is ""a dirty business"", Sollozzo  backed by the power of a rival mafia family headed by Don Phillip Tattaglia  orders an assassination attempt. Don Corleone barely survives the shooting and, for the love for his father, Vito's youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) decides to take action, masterminding a calculated move that will forever draw him in to the life of crime he always wanted to avoid.The cast assembled for The Godfather can lay claim to being possibly the greatest ensemble ever featured in an American film. Marlon Brando's career-reviving turn as the Godfather himself has already cemented its place in cinematic history  no more needs to be said. Al Pacino demonstrates a remarkable transformation from idealistic youth to cold, calculated heir to the Corleone throne. James Caan as Sonny, the Don's eldest son, is as explosive, violent, and temperamental as the pages of Puzo's bestseller describe, and Robert Duvall as adopted son and family Consiglieri (Counsellor) Tom Hagen is all logic and composure. But the praise should rightly stretch out to all, even those in small roles, as all play a part in making Coppola's world of Italian culture and underworld crime authentic and believable.When I try to pin down what it is, exactly, that makes a motion picture a ""classic"", I can't help but return to the notion of how memorable it is. This is ultimately where The Godfather qualifies  just about everything in this film is memorable in one way or another. We remember the acting  there is not a more iconic performance committed to film than Brando's Don Corleone. We remember Gordon Willis' celebrated cinematography, from the shadowy, atmospheric tension created in the offices where ""business"" is dealt, to his presentation of the sweeping, sun-kissed landscapes of Sicily. We remember the beautiful themes of Nino Rota's score  the haunting, lone trumpet that opens the picture and the full- fledged orchestral arrangement of the instantly recognizable ""Godfather Love Theme"". And who could forget the masterful inter-cutting during The Godfather's climactic baptism sequence? From the opening shot of the thickly accented undertaker proclaiming ""I Believe in America"", to final unforgettable shot in the Don's quarters of the door closing on Diane Keaton, who finally realises the truth of what has happened, Coppola has attained a directorial quintessence with The Godfather that he may never again reach. While watching the picture, we simply cannot wait until the time comes to sit down and view it again. It's a rare quality in a film, and the hallmark of a cinematic masterpiece."

Simply put, The Godfather is one of the best films ever made and is often considered to be the best by many. For an explanation, it's impossible to pick any one reason as this is a near perfect film with all elements set perfectly in place.A very important part of The Godfather's iconic status is Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone. His profile from the first film has provided a symbol which represents all three films, despite Brando only being in the first instalment, and an icon that commands respect. Brando appeared long finished as an actor, his looks diminishing and his status being lost but his classic performance in The Godfather put him firmly back on the acting map, where he now has a permanent place. His performance is excellent in this film, despite his mouth being crowded by moth balls! OK, so you can't hear every word he says, but you don't need to when his body language and non-verbal cues say so much for themselves. The character of Vito is very powerful, yet very frail and Brando puts these two qualities in perfect juxtaposition. A classic display, which still gets talked about 30 years on. Al Pacino whose film career was just beginning with this film, is also fantastic and ensured that wherever the film was plot wise, that powerful displays were on show at all times. His character transformation is compelling and his storyline with Diane Keaton is intriguing to give Godfather a more personal atmosphere and also to provide a much deeper plot. This film is seen as a landmark for acting, with Brando winning an Academy Award and with Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duval all receiving nominations.Central to the films core is the plot which is so intensely dramatic, that two hours does not seem enough to justify such a story. There are dozens of relationships involved in this story and there is an assassination plot and both Michael and Vito Corleone have their own separate storyline. All of these are done fantastically, ensuring the audience can have full empathy for all the characters and also be thoroughly entertained. Mario Puzo is clearly a gifted writer and does a fantastic job of portraying criminal organisations and what goes on in these families, a true representation or not, it makes for a fantastic film. Whilst his success in film was mainly limited to The Godfather series and Superman, Puzo must be gifted to write such material and was definitely worthy of the awards he won. The Godfather is a prime example of what is missing in most of today's films; a character driven plot. This film shows that you do not need explosions and high octane chases to keep an audience gripped and that a quality script and fascinating characters are enough to amass an audience.This is all wonderfully brought together by Francis Ford Coppola who, because of this film, has left his mark on the film world for eternity. It is the atmosphere he builds in this film that makes it so effective. Everything is dark and bleak except for when Pacino is exiled but that ends in tragedy. Coppola does brilliantly to emphasise the point that the world of criminal organisations is not a nice place and that no matter how safe you feel, your fate is waiting for you just around the corner. The film contains very little in the way of set pieces, instead everything appears very intimate, highlighting how personal the Mafia can be. The uncompromising nature of the film must have been very shocking at the time as there is a lot of violence that would have been skirted around at the time.The classic score to The Godfather is also integral to the film as it compliments all the visual elements on the screen. The sophisticated appearance of the Mafioso for instance and the general demeanour of the higher ranked gangsters are emphasised by the slow classical music.This film is responsible for most of the post modern approach to film making and acting and his also the landmark to which other crime movies compare themselves. The Godfather's image and style live to this day and will for generations to come. The first of a fantastic series, Godfather is an example of how films should be."

The movie has a belief in honor and traditionit also has a strong belief in power, though, a commitment to it. The respect for family in these movies is inexorably connected to the inconspicuous (or perhaps conspicuous)celebration of Don Corleone and his son Michael ""doing what it takes,"" acting illicitly as a kind of sacrifice, out of manly volition; in this aspect Michael and his father are like Fortinbras as opposed to Hamlet; by acting decisively they answer Hamlet's ""to be or not to be[?]"" with a firm ""to be."" When they reflect they are more like Hamlet himself, though they do not match Hamlet's scope of thought, but the movie supplies that missing profundity with the diffusive effect which is common to all films as inspired as this one: the look is just right, the pace, the music, the blocking and the photography in general."

When Michael rides in the 1941 Buick with McClusky and Sollozo, notice that the steering wheel shows a lot of wear on the rim, and the rear window panes are starting to delaminate- this is indicated by the odd shapes on lower inner corners of the glass. This would not occur on a car less than 10 years old (at the time of the scene), but certainly would on a car that was over thirty years old. Sonny's shooting was actually filmed on an airport runway, but the toll booths are exactly as I remember as I grew up on Long Island. I first saw The Godfather in a theatre in Roslyn, Long Island and got pulled over by a cop on the way there so I missed the first 20 minutes! It's still my favourite film."

Opportunists may triumph, but we will preserve HIS spirit in our minds, amen.If you go through the list of reviewers who love this movie and, if you listen to your friends who rave about its greatness, you'll find a not so astonishing leitmotif. They are almost all men. These men see ""The Godfather"" as symbolic of something. It's something sort of mystical, just like the rituals of the Catholic Churchgun smoke and incense. It has to do with the right of fatherly place, something which is being lost as time has marched on, ever onwards towards an oblivion of irrelevance for patriarchy, the family, private property and the State itself! We mourn the loss. We are nostalgic for these good old days. This is a tragedy. But, buck up, me buckos. It's also reality. You know that. That's what's so good about ""The Godfather"". It's REAL, baby! Don Vito Corleone is right to recognize that the potential violence embodied in HIM, the patriarch of the ruling family and his/its gang of servant/employees gives him the power to dispense justice. Kiss his hand. Lick it. He is Papa, you guinea. Justicewhat an abstraction, all filled with nicety-nice images of doing good unto others as you would have them do unto you. Pure crapola! You beat the crap out of your enemies and underlings and show them who's boss! That's the reality of everyday life within the political-economy of capitalism : political power comes out of the barrel of a gun baby and it hurts! Michael: So the next day, my father went to see him; only this time with Luca Brasi. And within an hour, he signed a release, for a certified check for $1000. Kay: How'd he do that? Michael: My father made him an offer he couldn't refuse. Kay: What was that? Luca Brasi held a gun to his head and my father assured him that either his brains, or his signature, would be on the contract. That's a true story. That's my family, Kay, it's not me. It's only the women-units, like Kay Adams who are confused and who need to be reminded, every once in a while. Kay ventures to open her mouth about politics and her naive liberalism is met with a quick back fist of REALITY by Michael Corleone, (who art her husband and budding patriarch in his own right, amen).MC: My father is no different than any other powerful man -- any man who's responsible for other people, like a senator or president. KAY: You know how naive you sound...senators and presidents don't have men killed. MC: Oh, who's being naive, Kay? That's it girls and the rest of you liberals and socialists. The richest one percent of the families in the USA own more of the well, no, I mean wealth, than the other ninety-percent of American families. For this, they get the best government money can buy. And, if someone stands in their way with some left-leaning line, well we know what happens to them.As Barzini says to the other Dons about sharing the spoils from the well of exploitation: Certainly, he can present a bill for such services. After all, we're not Communists. But he must let us draw the water from the well. Get it you softies? This is social darwinism in action, reduced to its simplest formula and ground down to its final solution. This is reality of THE GAME : dominance and submission, master and servant, the Godfather and you.Meanwhile, true women can talk about the kids, especially about the up and coming males. She can cook and clean. This is her place. She knows nothing about the realities of politics. It is a dog-eat-dog world outside of her properly protected areas of concern : with the kids, in the kitchen and at church.Don't get me wrong. This is a great flick. The acting was the best that most of these men ever did or would do. Of course, the women were a bit hollow. But that role fit the script. Francis Ford Coppola's direction was masterful as was his collaboration with Mario Puzo on the screenplay. The cinematography by Gordon Willis was appropriately brown, dark and conservative. The casting by Louis DiGiamio, Andrea Eastman and Fred Roos was near perfect.Brando's last scene in ""The Godfather"" was really the classic moment. But then, there were so many. Anyway, remember? He and his grandson playing in the garden. First Vito sprays the bugs. He pushes the device. Out comes the death spray. Down go the bugs. Then, he gives the push-spray gun to little Michael's son. The cute thing chases his grandfather around spraying insect killer at him like it was some kind of Tommy Gun until, boom, the old ticker gives out and Brando collapses. The kid doesn't know he's dead yet and so steps up to the body and sprays it some more. Rather like the last moments in Sonny's untimely death, no? Oh well, like father, like son."

Don Vito Corleone is a wise, benevolent patriarch to the Italian American community of New York, and gets into trouble with rival gangsters only because he refuses to take part in selling heroin. Unless you have been told that he is a criminal, you'd never know. You certainly never see the Corleones cheating or hurting honest citizens. That's what I mean when I say that the movie is crooked.Compare the Corleones to TV's Sopranos. Tony Soprano is overtly criminal-a brutal, thieving, murdering, adulterous extortionist who pretends to adhere to a Mafia code, which he breaks whenever it suits him to break it. This is why The Sopranos is artistically superior to The Godfather. The creators of the Sopranos have actually dared to make Tony Soprano and his fellow criminals hateful, which is just what you would expect real criminals to be. Don Corleone, on the other hand, resembles a real human being about as much as Tarzan of the Apes.So, great as The Godfather is as an entertainment, it fails as art."

As one of the most influential crime films, the Godfather is also much more than that.It tells the tale of how the aging Vito needs to decide who is to succeed him as don of the Corleone crime-family. Since he has three sons and thus only three possibilities, he finds it difficult to choose between the capable Sonny, the timid Fredo and the intelligent Michael. Each son is in a way unsuited, since Sonny is such a tremendous hothead, Fredo is not quite smart enough and Michael doesn't want to have anything to do with his father's business. When a drug dealer named Sollozo interferes with the family's business however, bad things happen to the Corleone family. Michael seems to be the only one capable of saving his relatives from the bad luck that haunts them. But by doing so, he will need to give up everything he had in mind for himself, and he could risk losing the love of his life, Kay. As much as the Godfather is a story about crime, it's also a story about loving and caring for your family and be willing to do anything for them.The acting performances are among the finest you'll ever witness.

He offers help to anyone who comes to him, expecting in return, only friendship. His denial to accept a narcotics deal gets him shot and although he survives, things are never the same again, with constant attempts to murder the bedridden Godfather.

One thing I like Don Vito Corleone is that he beat (though not depicted in the movie) the s**t out of the two punks who used violence on a girl. Nowadays, too many Americans ONLY blame other people or other things like they are the ONLY innocent ones. They kill because the video games are so violent, they steal because they cannot find a job paying them $30/hour to let them be a slacker, they sexually abuse minors because they are under control of the drug or alcohol, they are fat because the food is too delicious to resist. As a grown-up person, everybody should be responsible for his own wrongdoings. The video games will not open the TV by themselves, the alcohol or drug will not go into the body by itself and the delicious food will not go straight from the deep fryer into the stomach.

Every time i see it, i remember why these people feel like family to me: sonny is like an obnoxious older brother sometimes, hot headed, but genuinely loving and caring. Tom is the level headed man, who takes into consideration the wisest way to handle things and benefit the family. Fredo is the one that everyone loves, just because he can't take care of himself. and Michael, he's everyman isn't he? He has dreams and goals and wants to live his life independent of the influence of his family. but circumstance formulates, and deepens his character. He soon chooses a path that he swore he never would, but he is almost forced to do it. Granted, no one is pointing a gun to his head- but his heart compels him.and Don Vito himself. An aging king who's love for his family is what keeps him alive even after a brutal assassination attempt. What is he to do about his kingdom? he knows he has little time left, yet, his sons imperfections and his own regrets (though he says he has none) leave him questioning the future. I draw a parallel here to King Lear and even Kurosawa's Ran- Vito Corleone is much like the principal characters in these other two works, though more composed and strong in mind.Look beyond the violence, the slick talk, the plot. See the love, the family, the relationships. You'll be able to see your own family in the Corleones, as imperfect as they are (being that we need to remember that they are monsters, who murder people for personal gain) and more importantly, you'll be able to see yourself. Not one of us can say that we're any better- we can only say that we've chosen a different road."

I think Bob Evans should have shut his mouth during production of this film because he would have ruined its greatness had Coppola lost his will to direct under his constant complaining.

When I saw it I felt identified even though I have nothing to do with any mafia. The main point of this film is how Michael Corleone inherits the work of his father, Vito Corleone. This movie touched my emotions. It is greatly directed by my friend the great Francis Ford Copolla, greatly written by my dearest Mario Puzzo and PERFECTLY ACTED by my masters Marlo Brando and Al Pacino. It is not by coincidence that this is ranked Top 1 in the IMDb list. The character of MArlo Brando is the perfect character a film like this should have: an old wise man who knows whats good and bad for his business, who even though leads a huge criminal bloody almost gore mafia, has a soul of his own that manages to love his family.The Godfather is truly one of my favourite films, highly over-passing all the modern day high-tech criminal movies. The point that sets this whole story in motion is that it is not about crime, but about business, not clean but big business. And then comes Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, a humble little man whose life is happy and truthful. He's loyal to his country and opposes to work for his father and brother Sonny. Al Pacino, due to his usually expression-less face during The Godfather, shows he's was meant to be the one to inherit the ""familia"".The music is probably the memory that will remain longer from this movie in my mind. The famous waltz, and the famous theme used many times in the scenes of Scisilly. Try to never hear this songs until you see the movie and it will cause to even the bravest hearts some bit of emotion (which is hard to accomplish).Last but not least, Francis Ford Copolla direction is probably his best. He includes beautiful settings in Corleone, beautiful enegeryfull angles in the wedding scenes, some great camera movement, great timing so it is not too slow or too fast. Francis Ford Copolla is certainly one of the best directors and it is shown in this film. The Godfather is a classic which movie lovers cannot die without seeing. If you don't like it (something that I've never heard as a reaction to this film)you better begin question yourself."

It has a consistent rating of 9.1/10.0 and I was always fascinated by that. I had some really heavy duty expectations from this movie.A friend lent me his DVD and I finally saw this movie which has widely been said to be the greatest movie in all of film history! This was quite long ago, and in all honesty I wasn't very impressed in my first viewing (probably due to my ultra-high expectations). Now, I had heard about The Godfather Part II being better. Therefore, after knowing all the characters and the actual story in Part I, I rented Part II.This time, I was awestruck, as I totally fell in love with Part II! I shall leave the review of 'The Godfather Part II' to its own comments section.Since I loved Part II, I decided to watch the first installment again. Only this time, I liked it much better than the first viewing! It turned out to be one of those movies that get better with each viewing. I was also picking out the reasons why I hadn't liked it by itself at that time. First, though, the pluses, which are aplenty! Wonderful acting from everyone in the lead roles as well as the supporting cast. Marlon Brando never fails to amaze me with his majestic screen presence! Other bravura performances: Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Richard Castellano and Al Lettieri (as Virgil Solozzo). John Cazale is good too (although he has a bigger part in Part II, so he made a bigger impression there).The story: The novel is already one of the most popular books I've ever come across! The story is indeed powerful and quite gripping.The cinematography: Need I mention the already talked about sepia colors Coppola has used throughout the trilogy? They add a wonderful touch to the movie and it makes the movie look more ""beautiful""! The Lighting: Excellent effects; one noteworthy scene is the talk between Solozzo and Hagen. The dim lighting gives a brilliant touch to their topic of discussion! The score: Beautiful, haunting music that won't let go; I still casually whistle the tunes every now and then! Thus, as far as the technical aspects are concerned, the film is flawless! (well, almost...there are a few revealing mistakes as are listed in the goofs section of this movie!) Now the minuses: I was not happy with a couple of things. First of all, my biggest complaint..the length of Marlon Brando's screen time!! His scenes total to a length of not more than 50 mins in a running time of 175 mins!! Why? I just wished I could see more of his greater than great performance! Second thing: The blooming of Michael and Apollonia's romance in Sicily appears at a time when the story should've really moved ahead at the pace that it had caught! Those scenes in Sicily (him being ""hit by thunderbolt"" on seeing her; the exchange of glances, etc.) were just taking too long and could have easily been cut short! They just hampered the smooth flow of the story. I can say that 'The Godfather' is an almost perfect film! Minuses apart, the film has some really memorable scenes, which will go down in history as some of the classiest moments in cinema.The Godfather saga continues in Part II, which is even better than this first offer that no respectable movie buff can refuse....."

His character, Michael, at first does not want to take part in the family's business, but we soon see how one punch to the face by a cop can turn the tide, and Pacino creates a well drawn character for himself to play.

The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast.

Another great scene was when Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando) expresses his grief to Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) his son over Michael's current profession. He tells Michael as to how he once hoped that Michael would be the one to give the family a taste of Legality, but ended up being the Don who would head the Crime Family of the Corleone's.

It has been said many, many times before that ""all I need to know, I learned from the Godfather"" and truer words have never been spoken. At it's core, The Godfather is about family values. This movie isn't only about the mob or drugs or any of those things that's just one part of it, but ultimately, it's about family.

I've seen plenty this long and although I enjoyed them and watched parts of them again, I have never watched one like this all the way through. Let's take your standard gangster film, either you have the new guy just arrived in town looking for trouble, Joe from 'A fistfull of dollars', or you have the guy looking for revenge, Porter in Payback, or the cop trying to stop them, countless films. THIS IS DIFFERENT!! Sure you might say gangsters have been the guys your rooting for before but no not like this. You start with an established family, and you watch them fall into the ruin and gradually get saved. Brando and Pacino both deserve every award there is for making characters who although are often bad you can still see the old fashioned hero in. Not one bad actor, not one bad character. Not one bad moment. Yet why isn't it no. 1? Well I don't know but it isn't really no. 1 material. Perhaps its the fact you have so much story to take in and so much happens that you aren't sure whats just happened or it could be simple. I could have just expected a no. 1, a film that had me crying, cheering, yelling. I didn't get that but I cant think of one better gangster film, or one other film that deserves to be a classic like this. So perhaps it is a no. 1, for now until a true no. 1 comes along. For those of you who say 'the book was good, not sure if I want to see this', then I'll tell you this. This film is a book. not only is it a book, it's a great book. You cant put it down but when you do you can start anywhere. You can flick back to clarify what has happened, the story is well structured the characters well developed. It's well cut as if it's been edited by a publisher. I don't want to call this no. 1 because when you see it you'll constantly be judging it as a no. 1 film, like I was, and you will feel let down.

This is not, however, a fast-moving mob film like Martin Scorsese's work, but more of a drama. Also unlike Scorsese's work, this is more of a romanticised version of mob life, and you will grow to like the characters better because of this If Mafia films aren't your cup of tea I still recommend The Godfather as it depicts family life as well as Family life, showing how Don Vito keeps his family together through good and bad.

It tells the tale of one family and it's destiny...the Corleones. Don Vito Corleone (the Godfather) is the head of the Corleone family and runs his 1940's New York empire with Mafia justice. The story begins with the wedding of Vito's daughter, Connie, to Carlo Rizzi. Present in the wedding include Vito's sons and heirs, Sanito (""Sonny""), Fredo, and, most famous of all, Michael, the reluctant heir to his father's business.While the Corleone family is wealthy and fortunate, they also have some rival Mafia families, such as the Tattaglia, Sollozzo, Brasi, and son on and so forth. Tragedy occurs when Vito is injured by the gun of one of the rivals, and thus, a tale of the mafia, bloodshed, and family takes place. ""The Godfather"" chronicles the story of a family trying to stay on top during a dog-eat-dog era, revenge and murder, family and trust, as well as the rise of Michael Corleone as the don (head) of his family and how he avenged his entire family from all rivals.Puzo's novel was brought to the screen by legendary director Francis Ford Coppolla, whose daughter, Sophia, is now following his footsteps and unleashing her directional legacy with films like ""Virgin Suicides"" and ""Lost in Translation."" F.F. Coppolla uses his talents to tell Puzo's story through actors and actresses.Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone and brings a fine Michael Corleone, portraying the his character well. Pacino shows the evolution of Michael from the reluctant young man to this ruthless don and willing godfather like his dad. Diane Keaton also stars in this movie, playing Michael's non-Italian wife, Kay Adams. But, of course, the title role (the Godfather) is given to the recently-deceased legend Marlon Brando. Brando is truly Vito Corleone, bar none, and you better respect him or else.Other than the actors and actresses, the sets are good, too. This is not a cheery and bright film but a dark and gloomy epic. The grim and gritty 40's-50's NYC sets reflect the brutality of that time, when gangs were the rulers of New York's streets. However, the Corleone family's Italian heritage is also reflected, and who's better in making Italian music than Italian composer, Nino Rota? The Godfather theme song (""Speak Softly, Love"") is just as classic as the film.""The Godfather"" was released in 1972. It was a critical and commercial success, winning several Oscars, even, best of all, Best Picture. It was followed by 1974's ""Godfather, Part II,"" and 1990's ""Part III."" The first sequel was just as acclaimed as the first while the latter had mixed reviews. But still, all of these films are regardless as classics by critics and the movie-going public.

Robert Duval was really great. It is really hard to tell what is missing in this movie. The whole package was really astonishing. I have never imagined a movie will have such an impact on me as well as on many others. I have watched it with my brothers a couple of years ago. You won't believe it if I tell you that every year I go to a movie store and rent it again. I will be doing this for the rest of my life because it is an artistic piece that is worth watching more and more. In conclusion, I would like to say that if Marlon Brando had not been there, this movie would have lost a lot of its glimmering and shimmering light. Al Pacino was also as outstanding as Marlon Brando. The movie is a way beyond criticism. It is a work of art for all generations and at all times.

Marlon Brando is such a believable godfather that I think mafiosos throughout history would feel intimidated if they ever had to go to a ""meeting"" with Don Corleone.James Caan also provides a smashing performance as the hot-headed Sonny. His ferocity and high spirited attitude adds so much to the film. I've always wondered if Robert Duvall's natural speaking voice is that of Tom Hagan or of another one of his characters like the preacher or Gus.This is one of the few films that I will never, ever grow tired of watching.

To describe either film as being perfect is not an overstatement in any means.Coppola's mastery of direction is evident from the very beginning of the first film of the Godfather trilogy. The ""I Love America"" speech tells the audience exactly what they need to know about the world these characters inhabit, and the wedding that follows sets up all that is to befall ""the family"" over the course of the film. Coppola clearly demonstrates a true understanding of the delicate balance between the importance of camera work and the necessity of allowing master performers the latitude to develop their characters to the rich level they achieve.When one combines a perfect script with perfect performances by some of the legends of film, all under the guidance of a director with a mature and tasteful sense of the art of film, the results are inspiring. The Godfather and the Godfather Part II are my favourite films of all time simply because they are the closest thing that the 20th Century ever produced to Shakespearean tragedy.

This saga & story span many years but is entirely engaging throughout. Ultimately though, it has to be seen as the prototype great American saga family soap opera, and the one by which all others are judged. Much has been stated about Brando' performance -ultimately it's the restraint he shows in exposing the frailty of an ageing Mafia Don losing his grip on power and struggling to effectively raise his family and keep his favourite son out of a life of crime. Pacino is brilliant at conveying the transformation of innocent son struggling to keep the family business at arm's length, to the painful realisation for his family to survive he too must compromise to become the type of character he loathes yet is extremely effective at- both ruthless & uncompromising.Beautifully shot by Gordon Willis, and brilliantly acted by a cast that quite rightly all went on to become some of America's greatest actors of their generation. Every viewer I have spoken to is engaged and enchanted by the characters;both strenghths & foibles- Don Corleone is a man of great power, epitomising the dark & light sides of the American dream, but for the most part he uses it mercifully. we feel for this family's pain when they suffer loss despite their sins, & root for their merciless triumph.A great American masterwork, and one of the greatest films of all time."

All that is said about 'good', reveals itself in the story of this bad man. I am a fan of Vito Carlione, he is wise, he is respectful, he is a true capitalist.

Everyone knew that Michael was the smart, elite ""college boy"" of the family, and Sonny was the completely opposite, and someday he'd be the head, the new Don Corleone. Michael doesn't want to be involved in the family business, until Don Vito gets shot by some of his enemies because of the whole deal about whether drugs should be sold or not, and troubles start to happen. Michael knows he's the only one who he can save his father. When he agreed to take revenge to the enemies who shot his father, he had gotten himself into a completely new life filled with violence, hatred, and betrayal, a world he had never experienced before, and there's no turning back.I'm not gonna say what's going to happen next, for the people who haven't seen this yet.

Marlon Brando, who at first wasn't interested to play Don Vito Corleone, put down his most stunning performance ever. The characteristics, the voice of Brando match perfect with the some kind of mysterious Vito Corleone. This film is also the real start of the career of Al Pacino. After he played Michael Corleone, he was immediately given the role of young cop Serpico one year later in 1973. The best actors of two following eras meet here in this film. But the Godfather is more than just Brando or Pacino. We must certainly not forget the brilliant performances by James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton, all Oscar nominated. John Cazale playing Fredo Corleone stays a bit in the background. I liked him better in part 2. Francis Ford Coppola puts all this great actors together in a beautiful whole."

The series starts with Part 1, The Godfather, which is in the same category with Citizen Kane, Casablanca, The Searchers, and Schindler's List as the best movie of there respected Genres. As good as Marlon Brando is in this film, I think that his best film was On the Waterfront and this is his last goodbye. I realize that Last Tange in Paris was a great performance, but the Godfather was an icon for generations to come. Al Pacino in this film is absolutely superb and he only made it better in Part II. Many people put The Godfather as the number 1 movie of all time and I can't argue with that because of all that it has to offer. I think that Citizen Kane is more of a landmark because of all the things that Orson Welles brought to cinema from that movie, but if that is number 1, than Coppola has no shame in being the best number 2 of all time. The amazing thing about the Godfather Saga is that I think the world of Part 1, but I think that Part 2 is better. Bravo Francis, you have made your mark on Film forever, no doubt."

It is the greatest film ever, just like Casablanca, Shawshank Redemption and Shindlers List, it has mastered its genre, except many people do not know of the film!!! Now days movies such as oceans 11, Layer cake and even police investigative stories try to have the original concept of them film, with the moral battling of crime. The beauty of the story is that it is original and none of the actors (in the first part) were well known, which gives them an better on-screen identity, compared to modern day Hollywood heroes such as brad Pitt, Collin pharrel and Tom Cruise. Even action packed scarface can take The Godfathers title as 'Best Crime/Gangster Film Ever' because that is exactly what godfather is. Its only downfall is the conclusion of the saga, in part number three which is kind off like The Matrix trilogy in a way, The First part had a cult following, number 2 was ""good but will never beat the first"" and the third one was awful! The Godfather = legendary film, which will live long in existence especially with the Italian population! The only deteriorating factor is its lenght not many people can watch a film for 2 hours and 10 minutes, but i could :). Also the plot is tricky to understand for first time viewers!"

663,6142,False,0.1175060815699094,"One of the best thing about this film is the terrific performance of Brando asDon Vito Corleone. He created a character capable for transmitting themost ambiguous emotions. For one side, we have the loving father (and godfather of course), husband, grand father, friend. In the other hand he is one of the coldest blooded characters in movie history. ""It's not personal, it's strictly business"" is the perfect phrase to define the way of the ""Familia"" taking care of business related activities. There are several sequences that have become classic scenes: at the beginning of the movie we see a merciful Vito sitting in his ""throne"" deciding the destiny of dishonored fathers, Hollywood actors, rude bodyguards. ""Remember that some day I will ask another favor in return"". Don Vito is respected as a priest, his hand is kissed and he takes care of the situations one way of another. Religion is, ironically, one of the main characters of the history. Four major scenes are related with catholic rites: Two weddings, a funeral and a baptize. Italian costumes are essential as well. The family concept, the traditions; big dinners with pasta, meat balls and red wine. Concepts as honor, loyalty, vengeance are reminded consistently along the three hours. In another classic scene we visualize the ""familia"" way to solve some pending issues: Johnny, the favorite Vito's godsons is one of the hottest Hollywood stars hoping to obtain the leading role in a movie. The producer does not want him on the film for personal reasons, but at the end he accepts once he discovers his favorite horse head the next morning in his bed. Robert Duvall is the adviser, Vito's right hand and in my opinion the second best performance. He is responsible of dealing with the other families. He hates violence but justify every decision to use it. He is the conscience and a critical member, no matter if he is not Sicilian. Other sequence (I think the best) is where the big families have a meeting to solve their differences. Don Vito did not want to be involved in the drug business, he wanted to remain with the usual ones: gambling, liquor and unions. His relation ships with influent people are important to the mob environment. He agrees to permit the drug dealing and offers protection just with one condition: at this time his son Sonny (performed by James Caan) was brutally killed. He accepts his dead as a part of the business and he is willing to make a truce to stop the blood spill. In one of the best scenes ever performed by Brando he stands up and says (not literally): ""I won't revenge my son's death. Mike, my other son is hiding somewhere in Italy and he will return shortly. I accept the conditions to bring peace, but if my son is murdered in any way, shoot accidentally by a cop, have a car accident or appears hanging in his cell I will blame someone in this room"" an then he signed his agreement with a huge with his enemy. A good movie with excellent cast selection, including a good performance of young Al Pacino and his incidental transformation from war hero to new family Don. Coppola created a myth with his trilogy. The second part was actually better than the first one and this is much to say. The baptize sequence at the end is just extraordinary. The initiation of the new Don receiving the holy water and holy blood. A new life, a new grandson, a new era. The end is just the beginning. The familia is not dead is just taking care of business as usual."
664,6143,False,0.06291939379027556,"The Godfather was an epic novel, an excellent story, and the movie could have easily been botched on numerous levels; instead, Francis Ford Coppola managed to create an enduring masterpiece of modern cinema. This excellence he achieved in spite of the constant harassment and general incompetence of Paramount Pictures. Coppola was almost fired by the studio several times during the filming of this classic, yet he managed to persevere and realize his vision through to the end. The casting, direction, acting, cinematography, and story are all top notch. Add to it a beautiful score by Nino Rota and you have the #1 IMDb movie of all time. This is a movie I have watched many times and found few weaknesses.If Paramount had its way, The Godfather would have been much different. In this alternate reality, Coppola would have been fired and replaced with some studio sycophant director. There would be no Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, since Paramount felt Brando was a troublemaker. Michael would have been played by Ryan O'Neal or Robert Redford since Paramount wanted a ""prettier"" leading man. Al Pacino, despite superior acting ability, would have probably remained undiscovered. The story would not have taken place in the 40's and 50's, but instead would have been contemporary in order to minimize production costs. To be sure, the ultimate result of Paramount's expediency would have been unmitigated disaster. Thankfully, Coppola fought Paramount throughout the entire production, and much like the Godfather himself, refused to dance on the strings of those Paramount pezzonovante."

And with all the respect that I have for this heavyweight striking flick, my sub- conscience tells me that there seems to be an overrating that simply has been unable to be tamed down for years. First of all, this is a great gangster movie with the most common characteristics of a mafia circuit. Superb acting is harshly evident with a small dose of surrealism. This is everything a true-life movie needs to have. But, still, I think that this is somehow one-dimensional and self-appreciative. It doesn't have a universal sense of mafia mob but remains within the confines of a single direction of storytelling. It concentrates on the Italian mob, a single family and no further. It depicts, marvelously, the structure of that-time mafia entourage and the set of rules it was based upon. However, I think there have been several other movies which, if not as subtly as The Godfather, precisely have managed go beyond the classic understanding of mafia and grasped a wider span of this topic. Anyway, The Godfather, though overrated, still remains self-contained and deserves to be one of the best but with all this time having passed by, not the best one. 10/10"

Any new gangster movie these days offers very little of we didn't see in The Godfather. The hard-nosed brutality, the lust for money, the gambling, womanising. The only thing that no-one could ever pinch from The Godfather, and make it look better, is waking up to find the bloody-head of a horse, sleeping with you in your bed.The philosophy plays a big part of the film and provides its unique blend of characters with great depth. We also see a great zoom-in shot when Michael (Pacino) devises a plan to assassinate a mafia boss, that killed his father (Brando) and the dishonorable who Michael seeks revenge for receiving a black eye from him.

Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is discussing a problem with a close associate, while his mentor, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) stands on. The Don's three sons are outside celebrating the wedding: Sonny, the hot-tempered oldest brother; Fredo, the shy and quiet middle son; and Michael, the youngest son who has returned from fighting in World War II.

However, one day while shopping for food with Fredo, Don Corleone is shot by a betrayal, and is rushed to the hospital. The verdict: An assassination attempt. After hearing this, from Long Beach, California, Michael rushes back home to his father. After hearing about the ones who almost killed the Don, he plots revenge with Sonny and close associates. But a twist of fate happens to the family, and in the end, the once-reluctant Michael is made Don over the Corleones.Francis Ford Coppola beautifully shows a portrait of what seemed to be a harmless family into such malice. The story was adapted from the number one hit by Mario Puzo, who also collaborated with Coppola in this project. The cinematography is excellent, the screenplay gripping and intelligent, and the haunting but enchanting score is memorable. Marlon Brando is absolutely divine as the ruthless, merciful Don Corleone, which earned him the Oscar for Best Actor. New-comer Al Pacino is extremely excellent as Michael, showing both the innocence and fierceness of the son, and his performance received many praises. James Caan is great as scary Sonny, and Robert Duvall could not be a better Tom.Some notable scenes are the monologue, the Baptism, and the ever-famous horse-head-in-the-bed scene. This demonstrates how scary and malicious the Mob can be. With twists and turns, it shows that even the Mob can lead everyday lives, but one could have a particularly hard time dealing with carrying out a deadly job twenty-four seven.I personally love this movie, because of the intrigue I felt as I read some of the novel.

Marlon Brando's speech is imitated, the horse head scene has been poked to death, and the musical score is used in spoofs. Yes, here we have the quissential mafia film. One of the first, and still the best.It started off as a novel written by Mario Puzo, until Francis Ford Coppola came in and expressed his interests of turning it into a film. He took it to Paramount Pictures, and they originally slated it to be a modernized version. They figured it would be much cheaper to make it in the present day (1971) and would hit audiences harder. However, Coppola, along with Puzo, fought them day on end for the rights to leave it as it was. Eventually, they gave in, but gave Coppola even more troubles when they disagreed on practically half of Coppola's cast. Paramount eventually gave into Coppola again, and let him make the film. This film is magnificent in so many ways. Performances by Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, John Cazale, James Caan, and Marlon Brando make the film shine, and also make it some of the best acting ever caught on film. Most people will tell you that The Godfather is every guy's favorite film. I guess you could say that's true for the most part, although I know many women who love this film as well.

691,6170,False,0.10308369195318855,"The Godfather has quickly become this reviewer's favorite dramatic movie. With a mixture of love, action and scandalous plot developments not once in the 175 minutes of watching it did looking at the clock to see how much longer it would be come to mind.  There is such a sympathy created for the Corleone family that you end up rooting for them, even though they are a mafia related family.  It's crazy to think about really, for instance, this reviewer can't remember the last time she felt sympathy for a murderer  The Godfather is amazing, it's well written, and the cast just meshes well on screen.  The names can be confusing because they are all Italian and people address each other by their last name most of the time, but after a while it starts to make a little sense. 	The lead character of the movie is, surprisingly, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).  This story follows his coming of age from a young man wishing to get as far away from the business to his deep involvement after some family catastrophes.  Upon first introduction Michael is dressed in his service uniform and bringing a new love, Kay (Diane Keaton), to the wedding of his sister.  When Kay asks about his family, and his father in particular, Michael explains to her that his father is a mafia leader and he wants nothing at all to be like him.  So far, he had been doing very well at trying to keep himself separated, until one day when his father gets shot in the back several times and is put into the hospital.  Well, of course, the henchmen aren't going to be satisfied with just putting him in the hospital, they want to finish the job.  Luckily, Michael goes to visit his father and upon arrival realizes that there is no one there keeping guard over his father.  He calls his brother to get backup and places his father in a different room in the hospital.  The suspense in this scene is SO heavy it's almost suffocating, in a good way.  There are distant footsteps heard coming toward Michael's father and this reviewer felt her hands clench and her heart beat racing; it was so well done.  But this is the point when Michael really starts to enter the mafia; and he only gets deeper and deeper into it as the movie plays out. 	There is, however, one death scene that is a bit too played out.  A character is in a car and suddenly there are a gazillion guys around the car and they all have rapid firing guns.  Well, the character is shot while in the car and proceeds to crawl across the seat and exit out the passenger side of the car.  At which point, the character puts themselves in full exposure to the henchmen.  Why?  No clue, but then another 70 or 80 shots are successfully taken AND THEN one of the henchmen proceeds to take a few shots at close range and throw in a few kicks.  This is a bit excessive upon reflection but at the time, this reviewer almost cried.  It was SO unfair! If it wasn't for the fact that it is completely impossible, jumping into the screen to save the victim was all this reviewer could think of.  Once again, it's amazing because the victim wasn't exactly an angel to say the least. 	The story is truly what manipulates the audience to feel sympathy for this family.  They seem to be falling apart left and right, which is tough to see because they used to be such a strong unit.  The values of family love seem to be falling apart with each new marriage, the men are trying to stay ahead in the game but they keep getting attacked from behind because there are traitors amongst the alliances.  Personally, this reviewer can't wait to see the two following films in this trilogy and compare them to the first, because topping this one will be extremely difficult. 	If your looking for an awesome drama, watch The Godfather, it's got a little bit of everything in the story for everyone.  It's a great movie to watch on an icky day when you're stuck at home, because it will make time fly so fast."

Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a mafia family living in New York. The Don's main source of income is gambling and protection. Another head of another mafia family (Sollozzo) wants to sell drugs to gain profit, Don Vito hates the idea of selling drugs on the market, so an attempt to take his life is made. One special son of the Godfather is brought to light when this event happens. In the film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the films gives the viewer a feeling of sympathy for a mob family, when in reality, a person does not usually take the side of a mob family, doing things against the law to make profit. A couple of the ways this happens is the fact that it's felt that Don Corleone is trying to do the `right' and `honest' way to make his profit by not selling drugs. Also, by the death and injury of many family members, the film brings a feeling of understanding, sympathy, and compassion towards the Corleone's. The film includes numerous scenes of murder, often in an offensive amount. Some scene feature hideous lights jobs, to the point of not seeing the character's faces, or telling what is happening. Although very monotonous, the music and soundtrack the movie was well done, and really changed the feel of individual scenes. There was an excellent job of doing crescendos and making diminuendos of certain scene to build suspense, or foreshadowing an event.

694,6173,False,0.09390508801490263,"`The Godfather' is quite possibly one of the best movies made in history. This film has been quoted/mimicked time and time again, even in a Rugrats (the famous children's cartoon) episode. Why would this movie be quoted so much if it wasn't so amazing?  It wouldn't be. All the hype made about this movie really isn't understood until you actually watch the film.  It's a classic that can't be described.I suppose it's illustriousness could be arguable either way, but most viewers find this movie riveting and engaging.  One could understand how someone could find this movie dry, especially in the beginning.  If you're not familiar with the plot at all, many things could be missed the first time around.  It starts out at his daughters wedding, and from there, all the events can easily run together and cause a vast amount of confusion within the viewer.  If you stick to it, promises are that the movie does get betterimmensely. There isn't one single thing that makes this movie so remarkable.  It could be that it had a spectacular cast, intriguing plot, and very realistic situations.  Or, it could be that this movie has what any great story has, a huge change in the main character.  Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is by far one of the most interesting characters through the movie.  You watch every step of his moves, thoughts, actions and you see him evolve into the person his father tried so hard to keep him away from.   The actual scene where he makes his huge jump could be argued, but it is often believed that this change took place at the hospital.  This was his first opportunity to take charge of the `family business.'Many details, sentences, phrases could go into this review to describe the movie. But, words could never really fill all of the emotions that you experience during this film.  Out of all the classic films I've seen, this is by far the most captivating I've experienced. This film isn't recommended for smaller children, one because they wouldn't be able to comprehend as well as early adults would, and two, because there are some things that may be found offensive to a younger crowd. All in all, this movie receives a 10/10 stars for pure genius."
695,6174,False,0.08102510312886946,"The Godfather	Smart.  That's how I describe `The Godfather'.  Every aspect of this film is dripping with intellect.  The directing, the writing, the cinematography, and the acting.  And all the elements of the film are woven tightly together to make a very entertaining package. 	The intricate plot follows the development of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) and the enthralling drama that pursues his `family'.  The script does the impossible task of capturing the complex politics of organized crime, and makes it interesting to boot.  The plot leads the audience along its windy path where it comes across many peaks until it finally builds to the fantastic finale. 	To achieve this famous finish, the director employs the use of some pretty clever technical tricks.  To achieve suspense, he cleverly places the camera at angles that leads the audience one way, until he surprises them with the real result later on.  He also infuses the sound of the church organ music and the crying baby, and then gradually increases the decibels subtly and effectively.  That technique pulled the viewers in and made their knuckles white during the climax of the film.  The director was skillful in his mastery of all the film's techniques and in getting what he needed from the actors. 	This strong cast of cast of actors included Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Conn.  Each actor portrayed their characters profoundly.  Marlon Brando executed method acting techniques in a way that only a veteran like Marlon could.  Al Pacino clearly shows his character (Michael Corleone) grow and change.  His acting is subtle, confident and quiet until it explodes in an awesome rage. 	Michael Corleone is much like the entire movie.  `The Godfather' is subtle and complex, and it builds to the memorable finish.  `The Godfather' stimulates the mind and starts the blood and adrenaline pumping in anyone who watches it.  That is why I recommend this beautiful masterpiece to anyone and everyone with a thirst for quality film."

Between a quotable script, great theme music, and a fabulous main character, this film will keep the viewer wondering.  While watching `The Godfather', the viewer may recognize many lines.  Some of examples of those could be, ` I'll give em an offer he can't refuse,' or `Take it to the mattresses.'  Simply the fact that lines from the movie are well known, proves that this movie is worthy of watching.Throughout the movie, the same music is played over and over, but in different styles.  For example, if someone is about to get shot, the music speeds up, and almost gets scary.  When a happy time comes, the music gets softer, and more legato.Finally, one of the best things about this movie is the main character.  Al Pacino plays Michael, the child of the original Godfather.  After his father gets shot in a mob hit, Michael, takes over the family business, and completely changes who from the person he used to be.  Al Pacino is very believable in this role.Overall, this reviewer gives this movie a 9 out of 10.  It is definitely a movie worth seeing, but leave the kids at their friends, there is more gore than many would like."

The Godfather doesn't even glimpse at those characteristics, in contrast, it not only enthralls the audience, but also inspires other films relating to its topic.  The 1940s revolved around a tone that was dark, and uninviting to sympathy, while The Godfather actually triggers extreme emotion towards the, otherwise seen as, ""bad guys.""  Characters that are seriously stereotyped take a new spin and actually make the viewer feel involved in the events of the movie.  Michael, an army man in search of pure separation from his family and the family business, is in love with Kay, a young girl full of life and enthusiasm for Michael.  While his older brother struggles to keep the family name intact.The characters themselves shine in the light of a great story, full of excitement and suspense.  Talks of war between families and the spread of drugs and gambling keep the viewer interested throughout the long film.  The viewer is hopelessly involved with the family, having had no interaction with any real people or in conversations.The Godfather is timeless with awesome actors and angles, the subject matter is rather heavy and it should be seen by parents before viewing by children. It is definitely a ten on a scale where that rates the highest."
698,6177,False,0.11404848064333789,"Mario Puzo's The Godfather is a landmark of cinema.  The three-hour film is the result of an incredibly precise brand of filmmaking.  Despite the fact that the story spans a number of years and thousands of miles, there is a clear, very natural progression throughout the film (with the exception of a subplot or two).  The characters are complex and varied, each playing a specific role that contributes to the story.  The film does admirably well in keeping the story relatively coherent, despite its complexity.In the film, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a powerful crime family in New York.  He arranges killings and is involved in illegal gambling rings, among other things.  Yet to those who love him, he is known as a man of reason and justice.  He is the Godfather - a title of respect and endearment.  Many seek him out for his blessing, his advice  or a favor.  Despite the fact that he is, essentially, a murderer, the movie does an excellent job of making the audience respect him; the deaths he arranges are always justified in some manner to the audience.  They men killed are either other criminals - usually involved in narcotics and other crimes somewhat worse than the Corleones' - or are corrupt in some way, a danger to ""the family"" and probably murderers themselves.Vito's family has a hierarchical power structure.  At the top is the first-born, Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone (James Caan), hot-headed and vengeful, with a lust for power - he is inverse of the collected and methodical Vito. Then there is Fredo (John Cazale), the ambitious but ultimately incompetent son who is more interested in women and booze than the family business. Finally there is Michael (Al Pacino) - the youngest son who is clearly the central character throughout the film.Michael is a young World War II veteran who wants no part in his father's business.  His signature line is ""That's my family, Kay it's not me.""  He respects his father more than any other man, but he wants to live a different line.  He is a dynamic, fully-realized character that is absolutely convincing.  He is also a very different character at the end of the film - but in a way that is completely consistent with his personality.The film has an excellent pace.  There is an ebb and flow - the film begins rather slowly, then picks up the pace, and rises to the climax of the first act - and then the pace slows once more, only to build up suspense again to a final climax, in which all loose ends are neatly tied.  Never is the audience bored - the story keeps a tight grip on the viewer, ensuring that they wonder as to the fates of the characters even in the slowest parts - a remarkable accomplishment in of itself.The Godfather is a excellent film in every sense of the word - technically, aesthetically, in terms of story and characters, themes and music. It immerses the audience in a completely different - yet perhaps altogether to familiar - world.  It is a classic that is - and will be - rooted in film history."
699,6178,False,0.07975624994506036,"""The Godfather"" is an extremely well known movie and one thatthis reviewer just recently saw for the first time.  There is a lot oftalk about it being the best movie ever made but honestly, thereare other movies that could be better.  The cast was made up ofsome pretty famous actors and they all did marvelous acting jobs. The movie definitely wasn't lacking in that area.  It was a bigattention getter in the way that there could be a scene where theactors would be talking and talking, which isn't too exciting, andthen soon after it would be like ""BAM!"" and there was action.  Itwould certainly wake up anyone in the audience who might havebeen dozing off.  All in all, the movie didn't have too much talk, ortoo much action, it was just the right amount of both. It did have a superflous amount of special effects though, mostbeing gun shots and explosions.  Considering the fact that themovie is about the life of a crime family, the enormous amount ofkilling that there is throughout the film isn't too suprising.  Maybe alittle disturbing, but not suprisng.  This reviewer has never seen amovie with as much killing as ""The Godfather.""  It was likesomeone was killed from this family, so they killed the person whodid the killing.  Then that family killed the person who killed theirfamily member and it went on like that back and forth and back andforth, if that even makes sense.  It was like an argument.  Person # 1 says something to person # 2, so person #2 says somethingback to person #1 and so on and so on.  There was just anexcessive amount of killing.  In fact, all the killing is sort of the thingthat the viewer might remember the most about ""The Godfather."" This movie does something that a lot of movies dare not do.  It letssome main characters die.  That is probably the most unpredictable aspect of the entire movie.  When people watchmovies they don't expect any main characters to die and they rarelyever do.  The fact  that ""The Godfather"" does this, although it issad, is stupendous. The plot of  the movie revolves around the crime family, Corleone. It basically follows their lives during a certain period of time.  Whatthat period of time is, this reviewer does not exactly know.  In mostmovies, when there has been a big time difference they say at thebottom of the screen, ""one year later"" or something like that.  ""TheGodfather"" does not do that.  Instead of putting the time changeinto words at the bottom of the screen it's put into words that theactors say.  It makes it so the audience has to listen very closely tothe movie to hear how long its been since something happened. This reveiwer thinks that this is done because when words are putat the bottom of the screen, like subtitles, it distracts the viewer'sattention away from the movie and what is going on.  In ""TheGodfather"" there is not this problem. The clothing worn in the movie wasn't anything like big, fancycostumes, but there was something about them that was quiteinteresting.  If the viewer was really paying attention to the actors'outfits they would notice that the men are always wearing sometype of suit.  They're never caught walking around in casual wear,just suits.  And the women are always wearing dresses.  Theydon't wear pants with t-shirts, they wear dresses.  Tha'ts prettygrand if you ask me. ""The Godfather"" was a very superb movie, but there are others thatare better.  It's worst feature is the enormous amount of killing.  Itis entertaining to watch, but it's not one that this reviewer wouldwant to watch over and over again."

I could not get enough of Michael Corleone, that icy character that hardly lost his temper, and never would let you know what he was thinking, really gripped into watching this movie over and over again.my hat comes off to Francis and his team they have made a true masterpiece that is THE GODFATHER.

701,6180,False,0.1200832245570589,"Well what is there to say about this movie?  Is it still the top movie on this site, or is it not?  Personally, it is not one of the reviewer's all time favorites, but it is still a very good movie.  One significant  detail of this movie, is counter culture.  The movie is filled with it.As the movie starts Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), who is known as the Godfather, is in his office. It is his daughters wedding day, and according to  Sicilian tradition, he cannot refuse any requests that are made to him that day. The room is filled with people wanting something. The whole family is there for the occasion.  Michael (Al Pacino), the God father's youngest son , is back home from the war. He brings his new girl friend,   (Diane Keaton)  with him. Michael's brothers,  Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there too.Family loyalty is an important message that is stressed in this movie. The Don, Vito Corleone heads the family . He is against dealing in drugs. According to him,  society is not alarmed by liquor, gambling or prostitution, but he feels it is wrong to deal drugs. He refers to it as a dirty business. What appears to be a moral decision on the Don's part is really counter culture because his decision not to support dealing in drugs has nothing to do with the legality of it but because he feels society would not accept it.   A lot of emphasis is put on trusting a man's word, yet the central character do not always trust each other.  Woman are not highly regarded by the family. The Don's wife is only shown in a few scenes. Sonny ignores his wife. and the Don's daughter Connie's husband is not allowed into the family business. Instead, he given a job so he can earn a living.  The counter culture in this movie, represents the killings of innocent, and not so innocent people between families.  Throughout most of the movie, the Corleone family is in somewhat of a battle between another Italian family. Because of this, Don Corleone who is the Godfather of many, (Marlon Brando) is shot by one of the other families.  This heats up the subject for the Corleone family, because it puts two of his sons Michael (Al Pacino) and Santino `Sonny' (James Caan) in between a rock and a hard place.  That is just one of the examples of counter culture in this movie.  Here is another example.  Sunny finds out two different times that his sister's husband is beating her.  Outraged by all this happening, Sunny takes off to go find his brother in law.  The first time, he finds him, he is successful in beating the wind out of him, however the second time he gets gunned down by his in-laws.   Right about then, Don, is called to make a peace treaty with the other family, to stop all this violence between the families.  But are all the violent scenes in the movie over with? Unfortunately not. There are so many more examples of counter culture than the ones listed in this review. In order to see all the examples of counter culture, you would have to view the movie a couple times to understand what is going on in it.Over all, it was a very good movie in my opinion.  I was Glued to the edge of my seat the whole time, just waiting to see what happens next.  The reviewer gives The Godfather a five gold star rating."

The way Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo wrote this film so that the viewer actually sympathizes with the characters of the Italian mafia. Within the first scene the writers introduced all the main characters and all that's left to the film are twists, suspense, surprises and thrills.The film also has many romantic scenes. Michael Corleone (Pacino) is in Sicily and walking through the open country when he and his two bodyguards stumble upon a beautiful young woman leading a school of children. Their eyes meet and it's love at first sight.  Michael being brought up with the utmost respect went to the girls father and asked to meet her in the presence of their family. The viewer can't help but think `How sweet.' Fortunately the father approves and love blossoms into marriage.The acting in the film is like no other and with so many big stars the viewer can't help but be excited to see so many great names in one film. Marlon Brando plays the role of the Godfather AKA Don Corleone, the leader of one out of five Italian mafias in the New York area. The way Brando developed his character was amazing and his famous voice in the film that has been mimicked for 30 years now sounds untouchable in it's originality. Al Pacino plays Brando's son Michael Corleone, who actually wasn't wanted for the part at the time but the studio cast him with the recommendation from the Director (Francis Coppola). Pacino actually sets the bar for himself when he took this role, and for all the future roles he would play in Mafia movies. His acting is compelling, and his looks are almost unrecognizable.There are actually no innocent by-standers that get hurt or victimized in the film that you might see in other mafia movies. Infact everyone that ends up dead were people that were a part of one of the mafia families. The whole film is about respect and the closeness of family if you can see behind all the violence.The film is quite long to sit through in one sitting but is totally worth it by the end. The film will grab you in an instant with curiosity to the underground world of the mob.This is undoubtedly the best mob movie ever. This film is recommended for people that love mafia films.

In my opinion everyone who sees this movie will absolutely say it is good and will understand waht godfather means.

Only 8.5 out of 10 for me i'm afraid; I feel that it went on a tad too long. I believe that most films should only last for 2 hours max. Although I must confess in this case this movie could just be better than most?!Any longer than 2 hours and I would feel like I was showing off if I were a film maker if you know what I mean?? It's only my opinion though :)"

Listening to the commentary by Coppola on the DVD was great. It really showed the hell he was put through while making the movie. Some examples are: 1) He had to fight to get the actors he wanted (Vs. Paramount). The studio said no way to Brando. 2) He had the threat of a ""Studio"" director hanging over him at all times to take over at any time. 3) He had various crew members talking about him behind his back about how horrible he was. 4) The entire scene where Carlo is fighting with Connie was filmed because the studio felt that the movie didn't have enough action in it so there were going to bring in an action director to finish the film.And that's just some of the troubles he had. Listening to the commentary, it seemed like a real nightmare. And after all that, we are blessed with one of the, if not the, best film of all time. It's really a miracle in my opinion.

Yet he is and always shall be known as the man who directed the Godfather films, a series that has dominated and defined their creator in a way perhaps no other director can understand. Coppola has never been able to leave them alone, whether returning after 15 years to make a trilogy of the diptych, or re-editing the first two films into chronological order for a separate video release as The Godfather Saga. The films are our very own Shakespearean cycle: they tell a tale of a vicious mobster and his extended personal and professional families (once the stuff of righteous moral comeuppance), and they dared to present themselves with an epic sweep and an unapologetically tragic tone. Murder, it turned out, was a serious business. The first film remains a towering achievement, brilliantly cast and conceived. The entry of Michael Corleone into the family business, the transition of power from his father, the ruthless dispatch of his enemies--all this is told with an assurance that is breathtaking to behold. And it turned out to be merely prologue; two years later The Godfather, Part II balanced Michael's ever-greater acquisition of power and influence during the fall of Cuba with the story of his father's own youthful rise from immigrant slums. The stakes were higher, the story's construction more elaborate, and the isolated despair at the end wholly earned. (Has there ever been a cinematic performance greater than Al Pacino's Michael, so smart and ambitious, marching through the years into what he knows is his own doom with eyes open and hungry?) The Godfather, Part III was mostly written off as an attempted cash-in, but it is a wholly worthy conclusion, less slow than autumnally patient and almost merciless in the way it brings Michael's past sins crashing down around him even as he tries to redeem himself.--Bruce Reid"

To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy combined.Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. ""The Godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, ""The Godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.My Grade--- Part I: A Part II: B Part III: C-"

Well, Marlon won the big one after limited playing time in The Godfather, a movie that lasts for nearly three hours.When you think about how he still owns this film, it's close to scary.

Everything came together for this movie, the acting, music, screenplay, setting, the characters and the story. It did something rare it brought crime and family together in an almost mythical way. Also it brought Marlon Brando (The Godfather) as a passing Don to a new generation (Al Pacino), in essence the transfer of  power  was being passed from one generation to another Brando to Pacino, and in the second movie it was Brando to DeNiro. Aside from their great performances, James Caan and Robert Duvall were flawless. James Caan turns in the performance of a lifetime as Sonny Corelone, and Duvall is flawless as Consilgere to the Don. If you have read the book you know will know why it was perfectly transfered from the book to the big screen. Their will never be legends such as Brando and Pacino ever again, they became the characters, they weren't acting, THEY BECAME the characters.

Look at the expression on Al Pacino's face when he tells his brother never to take sides against the family again.  There is no doubt about the enormous anger he is fighting to control or about what the results will be if he ever loses that control.  Look at Marlon Brando as the reserved dignified old Don spending his last moments playing like a child with his grandson in the garden.  And look at Robert Duval when Sal pleads for the favor of his life after he has turned traitor to Michael. And last, look at Dianne Keaton in the last scene when she realizes the her husband IS the Godfather.These are the things that make a movie great.

What exactly is it about this movie that ranks it the #1 movie of all-time on many lists, including imdb.com's list?  It isn't just the plot.  While masterful, I have seen better plots before.  Not many, of course, and not better by much, but there still are a couple.  It's not just the acting.  Again, I am hard pressed to think of better performances, but there are a few out there.  I will say that Brando's acting, Pacino's, Caan's, Duvall's, Keaton's, and so many others all mixed together were awesome.  But it's not only the way each one acts, but also the way each one acts off the others.  But still, the acting alone could not make this movie #1.  The cinematography, the lighting, the sound, the musical score, all these were terrific, but none of them made this movie.  So then, what DOES make this movie what it is?  I would say that it is taking all of these elements together and breathing life into them.  Rather than simply being a voyeur, watching all the action from the outside, the viewer is thrust into the middle of it.  He becomes surrounded by the action and to a certain extent becomes part of the Corleone family.  And as the movie races towards its climax, the viewer is pulled emotionally at every turn, forcing hatred towards good people, love towards evil people, respect for those who do not deserve it, and ultimately a great deal of sympathy for a man who rules with an iron fist and seems to be too concerned with his own well-being to care about the feelings of anyone else.  And yet, at the same time, we see that he does care, and he does feel, and he does love.  There is a tremendous feeling of family in this movie, a great sense of belonging.  And I believe that is the secret to this movie.  The viewer is not left on the outside, but brought inside warmly to share the innermost thoughts and feelings of men he might normally avoid and fear.  And the viewer learns a profound secret by watching this movie: There is no greater desire than the desire to belong, to be a part of something, no matter what that something may be; and this desire will be ultimately fulfilled no matter how much it is ignored or resisted.  Underneath it all, we are all the same."

Even without understanding the dialogue's nuances or the elaborate twists, one is still inexorably drawn to the movie, as I found myself to be since the earliest time.One thing that makes this movie a classic is that it defined how bad violence in a movie can be. When you see movie character Luca Brasi stabbed in the hand while he's being strangled to death, you realize that the director likes to take this movie seriously and make an example of how far a movie can go when it comes to violence. I'll admit that when I saw this movie for the first time in my life it wasn't very good in my opinion. When I saw this movie being #3 on AFI's {American Film Institute} Top 100 American Movies Of All Time, I thought it really didn't deserved that spot. But when I gave it another chance, my opinion changed. I said to myself, ""This movie represents the best of movies like what the Statue of Liberty represnts to America"".In short, this movie is fantastic.

My favorite performance is one that often goes unnoticed:  Robert Duvall's muted, pitch perfect Tom Hagen.Perhaps the most neglected aspect of the film is how brilliantly Coppola and Puzo adapted the novel.  If you read the book, you'll find that all the novel's strengths are on display upon the screen, while none of its weaknesses, or even interesting extraneous material, appear in the script.

The first one had James Caan and, one of my favourite performances of all time, Marlon Brando as the older and wiser Don Vito Corleone which is shared by De Niro.  Because Brando won the Academy Award for his acting, the character Vito Corleone holds a record for being the only character to have received two Academy Awards; shared by no one.  I think what made the first movie for me was Marlon Brando.There's no way in the world to tell whether the first Godfather is better than The Godfather Part II.

Of all the movies I've watched, I feel that this one has had the biggest impact on me. To me, being allowed to watch The Godfather is a gift. It's more than just watching a great movie: It's like observing a timeless piece of art by Leonardo Da Vinci. The Godfather is a movie that tells the touching and invincible tail of the Corleones, an Italian family living in New York that is involved in the mafia affairs in the city. A drug lord named Virgil Sollozzo wants to start shipping drugs all over New York and asks Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) to help him with his affairs. Corleone does not approve of the idea and would rather stick to his own business. Angry with the rejection, Sollozzo sends two of his thugs try to kill him, but he survives. Michael (Al Pacino), the youngest of all the sons, wants to be the man to protect his father, although the other members of the family don't want him caught up in the affair. The plot rises in levels of drama and thrills as the film goes on, and it just gets better and better. Most of the scenes easily stand out as some of the greatest moments in movie history, such as:
The beginning. What else? No one could ever forget the thought provoking scenes with Brando stroking his cat and negotiating with his close friends and relatives.Michael's assassination of the cop and Sollozzo at a small diner.
Michael being named the new godfather. The killings of family enemies during the baptism.Of course, these are not the only fantastic scenes in the movie. The Godfather also has an A++ cast, like almost everyone who has watched it will tell you. It practically made the careers of Francis Ford Coppola, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and of course, Al Pacino. Best of all, it has Marlon Brando at what could be his finest (I still haven't seen Apocalypse Now). I know it's been said many times, but I'll add my two cents anyway by saying that The Godfather is a classic and is pretty much flawless.

Firstly, the aesthetics mark it out as a classic: some shots, such as those of Vito Corleone in his study, could be removed from the film and considered art by themselves. Not only are the costumes beautiful, the lighting, sets and movement makes the film absolutely stunning, visually. All scenes appear to have a mild sepia tint and the lights particularly focus our eyes on peoples' expressions.Of course a film cannot survive on aesthetic beauty alone: the subtlety in the acting is superb. Al Pacino's face fleshes out his character perfectly and the mannerisms and prescence of each character is distinct and revealing. Although it is occasionally difficult to understand Marlon Brando, his screen prescence is astonishing and he, as the head of the family, he dominates his scenes. Yet there is something in Michael Corleone that singles him out, and Al Pacino really brings this to the role.I am less interested in the film's social commentary, although it is present and strong. The film has a distinctly 'epic' feel to it and as a result seems relatively objective. It does an astonishing job of presenting the characters as human beings and brothers and fathers and friends. In most films, the same characters would be painted by the film as either violent thugs or murderers. Of course, the director does not insult our intelligence, and this is what makes the film so good: Michael Corleone is a murderer and a thug, and the film does not hide this; yet we identify with him and we understand his motives and his mind.

Both the book and the film have been so popular, in my opinion, because they provide a stylistic and romantic view of power-a subject which we Americans have always struggled with. Most Americans (especially men) like and admire Vito and Micheal Corleone. The fact that they are criminals doesn't bother us at all. Usually a character must be empowered by the law or seeking justice in order for us to sympathize with him or condone actions we normally view as evil. That is not the case with the Corleones. We like them because they are powerful in and of themselves. The actions of the Corleone family are sometimes motivated by revenge, but more often the goal is to simply gain more power. We excuse them of murder because we see them as being outside of and above the law.
The reason that this film is so appealing (beyond the phenomenal acting, the wonderful quotes, the artistry and originality or the director, etc.) is because deep down, most of us want to be Vito Corleone. We want to be powerful enough to protect our families and our friends. We want our enemies to fear us. We want the money that goes hand in hand with such power. (You'll notice, that in all three Godfather stories, the power brings in the money, not visa versa.) Sure, most of us would rather come by it honestly, but in the end we just want that kind of control. For most of us, Vito Corleone embodies the American dream."

It tells the story of the Corleone Family, a big Mafia family engrossed in a rapidly escalating gang war of the different families of New York. At the helm is Vito Corleone, the patriarch of the family. His sons, Fredo, Sonny and Michael. Sonny is deeply involved in the family business, and he's obviously the heir to the throne. Michael is the oddball. He's a war hero, and wants no part in the family business. But as events unfold, that changes.The acting is superb. The writing is the best I've ever seen in any film. I've just recently seen this movie in its entirety, and it's everything I've heard. I love this movie, and I think that it changed the way we watch movies.

But that's the ticket with this movie, Clemenza, Pauli, Tom, Santino, Sal ... these people are so real, it's scary.

I read some comments saying that you can't fell anything for the characters. That isn't so at all. Vito Corleone is the best explanation of what evil is like. Not something supernatural, but something that comes out of human being (in fact, evil is one of the most human things there are). The Godfather tries to help people, and he does, only he kills and violate laws in the process. And what about Kay. Not much people talk about her because the movie is about men's power, but she was my favorite character, just the same, and it was a pity for me that Mario Puzo didn't tell her story in the film as he does in the book. She is lovely because of her love (a love, just as love is: strange) she is willing to pass through the good and the bad of the Corleone family.Connie was bitchy, but not enough to be beaten by Carlo and it was horrible the way her father just ignore that. Good for Sonny, although he was killed. Fredo is a shame because he is good in so many things, and he complains about not doing what he'd hate to do. You have to watch the Godfather II, or read the book to understand.After watching it several times, I understood how Michael became the monster that hits Kay. At the beggining he tells her something like he is not like his family, and at the end of the sequel he talks about murder like it's as normal as going to work.Really the movie is good, but is hard, it takes time to tell its story, and you have to watch it several times to understand it completely (is the kind of movie where a simple name someone says once at the beginning can affect the entire movie) or read that wonderful book."

In fact, Apocalypse Now (also directed by Coppola) is probably better in terms of visual style and cause, but Mario Puzo (who also wrote the novel THE GODFATHER) and Francis Ford Coppola's screenplay is surpisingly cohesive, and Gordon Willis' stunning photography accentuates the period feel of the film.  It is like no other work of cinema to come out of the 70s and will never be topped.  Not even by Coppola.  The story is so reminiscent of Shakespeare and Greek tragedies that Corleone seems almost mythological.  All in all this is a film about finding the American dream.  It's a film about honor, respect and tradition.

I.e.: how they gained political influence among society, how michael grew distant and how the rest of them drew close, and then skip 40-50 years ahead to vincent corleone losing the bussiness that was worked upon so hard to gain, through drugs and loss of all political influence and respect, whilst haunted by the loss of his cousin love, and ironically have one final scene with Michael and vincent before michael died. i.e.: this would be a part 2 narrative.This was majorly discussed, but time was not on puzo's side to write it, and francis refuses this to be done without puzo.One might say ""How about Scorsese?"" but lets face it, this was a coppola/puzo thing.

817,6296,False,0.13362072909102124,"The ""Godfather"" is Frances Ford Coppola's best film. Marlon Brando gives the most memorable performance in film history as Vito Corleone. The Movie is based on the gripping and compulsive book, The Godfather. Al Pacino gives a legendary performances as Michael Corleone.The beginning is set late in the summer of 1945. The films roots, however, are set in the gangster films of the early thirties. The plot is about rival gangs murdering each other, and now we see the inbred corrupt system of loyalty and terror, in which killing is a preferred way of dealing with the competition. We see how the gangs encroach on each other and why this form of illegal business inevitably erupts in violence. We see their subculture, based on a split between the men's conception of their responsibilities, which they keep dark form there families, and the false world the create to shelter the women and children.The visual scheme is based on the most obvious life and death contrasts, the men meet and conduct their business in deep toned, shuttered rooms, lighted by lamps even in the daytime, and the story moves back and forth between this hidden, world and the sunshine that they share with the woman and children. The tension is in the meetings  held in the underworld darkness and one gets the feeling that this secret life has its own poetry of fear. The dark and light contrast is so operatic and so openly symbolic that it perfectly expresses the basic nature of the material. Noting the Catholic background of the characters and the eternal battle of good and evil, of innocence versus knowledge, knowledge in this instance equates with shame nd guilt. BRANDOThe enormous cast is lead by Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, the ""Godfather"" of a powerful Sicilian - American clan, with James Caan as his hothead son, sonny, and Al Pacino as the thoughtful, educated son, Micheal. Is Brando marvelous? Yes, he is, but then he often is, he was marvelous a few years ago in ""On The Waterfront."" He's shockingly effective in a current film, the ""Score."" The role of Don Corleone, a patriarch in his early sixties, allows him to release more of the gentleness that was so seductive and unsettling. Don Vito could be played as a magnificent old warrior, a noble killer, a handsome bull, but Brando manages to humanize him. Brando internalizes Don Vito's power, makes him less physically threatening and deeper, hidden within himself.THE CAST However, Brando isn't the whole show; James Caan is very fine actor , and so are Robert Duvall and many others in lesser roles. Don sons suggest different aspects of Brando, Caan's Sonny looks like the muscular young Brando, while his heir, Michael, and Al Pacino comes to resemble him in manner and voice. Like Brando in this film, Pacino is simple, you don't catch him acting, yet he manages to change from a small, fresh-faced, darkly handsome college boy into an underworld lord, becoming more intense, smaller, and more isolated at every step. Coppola doesn't stess the father and son links, they are simply there for us to notice when we will. In the end of the ""Godfather"" nothing is resolved, because the family business goes on. Terry Malloy didn't clean up the docks at the end of ""On The Waterfront"", that was a lie. The ""Godfather"" is popular melodrama, but it expresses a new tragic realism.I don't have to recommend this film. I give it a 15 out of 10."

It scores a 10 in my book, not surprisingly, but I will include what I consider to be some minor flaws. First and foremost, the kindheartedness of Brando's Vito Corleone character is extremely misleading.  I don't believe that any mob boss of that era, or even today, possesses anything but heartless greed for money and power. The viewer is left thinking that Vito is warm and gentle and had no choice but to enter the life of crime to support his family--bulls**t! The sequel (another gem) tries to explain this, but I still don't buy it.  Also, I don't think James Caan was cast well as the hot-headed Sonny.  He looks about as Italian as James Cagney.  His acting is superb, but I think someone like Robert DeNiro (who also auditioned for the role!) would have delivered a far more accurate portrayal.  On that note, it also struck me that Richard Castellano, who plays Clemenza, could have just as convincingly played the Don as Marlon Brando and, perhaps, saved the producers millions. Brando is, of course, phenomenal, but I think it's important to point out that the less recognized co-stars are comparably as talented.

It is less about crime and more about the trials of any normal family.  It casts light on the hypocrisy of the establishment through showing society its own dark underbelly.  The thought that a mafia don is no different than a Senator or President (Kay and Michael's discussion after Michael returns from Sicily and tells Kay he is running the family business), shows how naive society can be and how quick it is to offer blame on people who believe in something as opposed to nothing.

843,6322,False,0.10138764661754779,"""The Godfather"" is one of the crossroads one must cross before proclaiming oneself a movie fan and a genuine movie buff.  Francis Ford Coppola's film is probably his most flawless, although it is NOT my favorite Coppola film (that honor belongs to the unmistakably problematic but highly visionary ""Apocalypse Now"").  Still, in the midst of a 90s cinema which seems to re-evalutate itself every five years or so with new computer-generated images and thusly cannot enjoy the same degree of timelessness of several earlier, better movies, ""The Godfather"" will undoubtedly hold its own as one of the most artistic endeavors in the relatively new medium of cinema.The story has been told many times before: based on Mario Puzo's bestseller, the film examines the aura of the Italian Mafiosi as exemplified through the Corleone family, led by patriarch Vito (Marlon Brando, an Oscar winner in a very professional bit of acting).  WWII-hero Michael (Al Pacino--the real star of the film as well as the real Best Actor of that year) comes home and breaks family tradition at his sister Connie's wedding ceremony not only by wearing his military uniform, but introducing his family to his WASP-ish girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), the epitome of modernistic feminine and Protestant intentions in the Corleone's traditional Catholic--and increasingly outdated--worldview.  The wedding scene is one of the great expositions of cinema, and yet the film lives up to all expectations by dashing us headlong into the Corleone's violent world.  Of course who can forget the severed horse head in the mansion of the luxurious Hollywood producer, the murder of Luca Brasi, ""sleeping with the fishes"", Santino's bloody murder at the toll booth, Brando's death scene, the intercutting between the baptism and the murders, and especially the final scene as the door closes and Kay realizes the deceit her entire life will become? To launch into a detailed discussion of Coppola's masterly filmmaking would take beyond 1000 words, so let me just echo the comments of many when saying ""The Godfather"" is that priceless canoli one should always cherish amidst the decaying corpses of escalating Hollywood trash."

Even without understanding the dialogue's nuances or the storyline's elaborate twists, one is still inexorably drawn to the movie, as I found myself to be since the earliest time. What makes it so enormously appealing and deeply satisfying is Copolla's masterful direction. Every frame is constructed in such an ingenious manner, that if taken out of context and hung up on a wall as a painting, it would take up another value, becoming as work of art in and of itself. Indeed, it is tempting to compare the dark indoor compositions (the mise-en-scenes' arrangement especially) to Rembrandt and other Dutch masters, without exaggeration. The staging of each scene is handled with the kind of technical and spiritual balance advocated only in Eastern religions: no extreme close-ups, no jittery or stale camera movements. On a visual level, ""The Godfather"" possesses an ethereal beauty regardless of content. The picture's other aspects reveal an astounding proximity to irrefutable perfection: an immortal original score with at least three distinguished motifs; the superlative acting by all of the Corleone Mafia clan and their enemies; the compelling plot which swiftly unfolds before us through, among other things, the most riveting montage since ""Battleship Potemkin"", no less. Even its minute details are widely quoted today: what comes most easily to mind is the shot-by-shot parody of Brando's botched assassination in '99's ""Analyze This"", and the more obscure slang term : ""to pull a Fredo"", coined  in ""Swingers"" (one of the 90's hippest comedies).

A masterpiece of American filmmaking; less derivative and more seminal than other films previous and since.  Novelist-screenwriter Mario Puzo and screenwriter/director Francis Ford Coppola care for the characters they wrought here, and the two sequels.

A must see."
855,6334,False,0.1660728633162124,"Often imitated, never bettered and perhaps only equalled by ""Goodfellas"", Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" saga remains for many the greatest crime story ever put on celluloid.  Epic, sprawling, grandiose and exquisite, the Corleone story has become part of modern popular culture and has inspired a whole new mentality regarding gangsters' and the role of organised crime in modern society.  While the fabric of the real mafia has worn in recent years, ""The Godfather"" series remains the most romantic and nostalgic depiction of a society living above the law.  It's a tour-de-force for just about all involved, none more so than the director himself.Coppola had made seven unsuccessful films before he contacted author Mario Puzo, whose novel about a fictional Sicilian  American family of crime had become a best seller.  Urged on by his heritage and commitment to creating a film that would match his huge ego, Coppola sat down with Puzo (when he could pull him away from the Black Jack tables of Las Vegas and Reno) and re-wrote the story.  The result was a screenplay of supreme quality, eschewing the soap opera, meandering work of Puzo's novel for a tight, taut and fluid narrative.The legacy behind Coppola's involvement on the film belies belief when we consider how well the film turns out.  Paramount, by all accounts, despised Coppola.  Through the entire film's shooting a standby director was waiting to take over as Coppola's head was constantly on the chopping board.  It was at Coppola's insistence that Marlon Brando, who had not made a decent film for a good decade, be cast as Don Vito Corleone.  Paramount wanted Frank Sinatra.  Coppola also had to convince the studio that a young Al Pacino, 26 at the time, should play Michael Corleone, the aire to Vito.  Studio executives thought Pacino lacked depth and was too small and scrawny to play the part.  James Caan, who eventually played Sonny, was pencilled in early as Michael.  Things could have been so different.The story is based around the final years of the reign of Vito Corleone (Brando), a Sicilian immigrant who had formed a powerful empire of crime in New York.  Now a man with powerful connections in the political and legal systems, Corleone is almost untouchable.  His family consists of three sons; tough, aggressive eldest son Sonny (James Caan); weak, feeble but good-natured Fredo (John Cazale) and smart, quiet and distant Michael (Pacino).  He also has an adopted son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), who also acts as the family's legal advisor  the Consilari.  The youngest child is daughter Connie (Talia Shire).  Sonny is next in line to take over the family business when Vito's time draws to a close, but his aggressive nature could be his undoing.  When Vito denies capital assistance to Virgil The Turk' Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) for heroin trafficking, things take a downward turn.  Michael assumes the role of Don and in the process the cracks in the family empire begin to appear.  We witness the painfully slow collapse of the Corleone empire, as Michael's friends turn into enemies and the honour and code (Omerta) of the past becomes virtually non-existent.Brando was awarded the Oscar for Best Actor as Vito and it is well deserved. He is utterly convincing and memorable, despite the numerous parodies on the character.  But it is Pacino who shines as the ever-insular Michael. Starting out as idealistic war hero and ending the first film as power corrupted mafia boss, Pacino's portrayal of the youngest Corleone shifts seamlessly along.  Pacino is at his best when his character is faced with a personal dilemma, not one associated with business'. 
Of course the entire cast is brilliant.  James Caan commands the first third of the film as Sonny.  He is pure aggression, an old school tough guy who acts first and thinks later.  Robert Duvall is solid as Hagen and is at his best in the early scenes involving studio hotshot Jack Woltz (John Morley). Diane Keaton is excellent as Kaye Adams, the WASP whose life is changed forever when she agrees to marry Michael.  In the limited screentime allocated to her character Keaton gives it her all and is a far cry from the characters she became associated with in her Woody Allen films.  Other actors of note include Richard Castellano as Capo Regime Peter Clemenza, Abe Vigoda as Tessio, Richard Conte as Don Barzini and Sterling Hayden as corrupt cop Captain McKluskey.  Even the minor characters in the film are memorable.The production design by Dean Tavoularis is exquisite.  The Don's den is brilliantly lit, or more so unlit.  It consumes its inhabitants in the shadows, and the Don himself moves with stealth around his cavernous headquarters.  Complementing the design is the brilliant cinematography by Gordon Willis.  The film is shot with a soft yellow filter, giving it an aged feel.  When the film relocates to Sicily, Willis opens up the screen and fills it with breathtaking surroundings and the quaint, quiet environment of the tiny villages where the saga all began.  Then when the film returns to the United States and Michael begins his ascendancy to the upper-echelons of power, Willis turns down the colour and presents Michael as an almost dead character, stripped of life and feeling.  It's a great touch and is best emphasised when Michael woos Kaye, albeit without an inkling of charm, back into his life.  He gestures Kaye towards the car, which resembles a Hearse more than a limo and her life in his downward spiral begins.""The Godfather"" smashed all box office records before it and spawned the blockbuster': one film from one studio that would be able to crush any of its opponents.  The film took home three Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Actor (rejected by Brando) and Screenplay from Previously Published material.  With Coppola now on top and Paramount in his corner the stage was set for the next chapter in the saga.  But that's another story altogether"

To call this film garbage is idiocy, there is no excuse, anyone who might make such a statement obviously has no clue about movies, even if they try to state otherwise.

It's a shame that people buy into the gangster formula created by Hollywood, it's a worse shame that people expect it, and when they do not see it they demand it!  This film breaks out of the formula, and it does so shamelessly, but it doesn't do it thoughtlessly.  There are truly excellent ironic statements all throughout the film, it surprises me that some people who claim to have some knowledge about film miss them.  The baptism that Michael Corleone attends is just one example, the shots of the baptism are juxtaposed with intercut shots of brutal killings taking place at approximately the same time, killings that were ordered by Michael as he took over the ""family business"".

The entire cast shines; no wonder so many of them--mostly unknowns at the time, like Pacino, Duvall, Keaton, and Caan--went on to stellar careers. But two performances stand out: Brando's and Pacino's.
Don Corleone is, in reality, little more than a well-dressed thug. But Brando infuses the Don with a regal manner: he carries himself like a king and speaks in dignified cadences. He dispenses vengeance and vice, but calls them justice and business. Even that infamous mumbling adds to the effect--it makes everyone (including the audience) lean forward, in respectful silence, to hear this powerful man speak. We should despise Corleone, but Brando's charisma in the role--arguably his best in a remarkable career--wins us over.It's Pacino, however, who carries the bulk of the film, along with our sympathy. He is, we are led to believe, the hero of the story: when Michael first appears, he's outside in the light, whereas the Don first appeared in a dark, shaded lair. He's in love with a woman from a brighter world (it's no coincidence Diane Keaton's hair was coloured blonde for this movie), and assures her that he's not like the rest of his family. We want the best for him: we hope he'll escape his family's unsavory business.But gradually, Michael gets drawn into those dark rooms his father inhabits. Pacino masterfully portrays a character who tries to be a hero, who tries to defend or avenge those he loves, but loses himself in the process. By the end of the film, Michael Corleone is positively reptillian--cold-blooded, predatory, calculating, a creature without remorse or morality. He has gained the world but lost his soul. Normally, we would regard a man like Michael Corleone from afar with a mixture of revulsion and fear. We would think him inhuman, refusing to recognize anything of ourselves in him. But Coppola makes us identify with Michael, sympathize with him. If he's become a monster by the end of the film, we've been forced to recognize that we, too, could become monsters in the right (or wrong) circumstances. We have stared into the abyss, and found that it contains a dark, distorted reflection.With The Godfather, Coppola et al took rather base source material--a pulp crime novel--and elevated it to the realm of Shakespearean tragedy. This is great story-telling, great movie-making, and great art. 10/10."

Coppola, along with his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, and his production designer, Dear Tavoularis, have created a history wholly realized, burnished brown as if a memory that will never completely fade. The world of the Cosa Nostra they present is closed and stuffy which provides an intimacy that generates an extraordinary amount of warmth and a feeling of lives being affected. The cast is flawless: the actors, to a person, inhabit the characters with such understanding and affection that they will be forever associated with them. (Al Pacino as Michael in the trilogy will never be able to match this work elsewhere.) But it is Marlon Brando in the title role that delivers such devastating work that you can only sit and stare in wonderment. Brando has a presence wise beyond his years and his gentle, thoughtful manner is never once betrayed his calculating, violent acts. Every movement, every vocal inflection is detailed and planned but he offers a spontaneity that never reveals technique. Guided by Coppola's abiding dedication to realism, Brando pushes this film to icon status. Not to be missed."

Perhaps not knowing how successful this movie was helped , i watched the movie  without knowing it 's background or having read Mario Puzo's bestselling book .

The movie haunts you long after u have finished seeing it whether it 's the godfather theme or Marlon Brando and Al Pacino's ground - breaking performances ( who could he lose to at the oscars in the best supporting actor category ? ) .Until now , there are very few gangster moives that make use of so few expletives , it 's amazing even in the 70's it gives credit to the script for creating an impact without using forceful language. The ideal of the film is what stands out that the youngest son in the family underestimated from day one saves the family when they are close to being destroyed by the other families .Although it's Micheal Corleone who holds centre - stage towards the second half of this movie and the subsequent two sequels .I feel that it 's really vito corleone who is the stand -out character of the series played by both Brando and De Niro (both earning oscars ) . In conclusion , There is no doubt this is the greatest movie of all time , very few can match this movie except for probably it 's sequel PT-II was brillant as well , but still could not match up to it's predecessor .So , there's no doubt that it 's the most watched movie of all time and will continue to be for some time to come . just can't wait to get my hands on the DVD version ."

Coppola has taken the concept of organized crime in America, something that was once looked down upon, and has built a cult following around it, with Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as their leading figures. And I don't think any single film has produced as many memorable scenes as The Godfather. Who could ever forget Marlon Brando, as Vito Corleone, buying those oranges on that fateful day? Or James Caan, as Sonny Corleone, getting massacred by the barrage of machine-gun bullets? And lines that will forever be repeated by fans like, ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" The bottom line is that The Godfather has changed the way we look and judge films. It has made cool what is sinful, crime a family value, and dynamic characters the modern-day icons of several generations of storytelling in film. Alongside all the revolutionary pictures of all time, The Godfather earns it place at the very top.

As head of the Corleone family Don Vito (outstanding Marlon Brando) is ambushed and shot and put to hospital, his sons, Michael youngest of them, unwilling heir of the family top spot (Al Pacino), hot head oldest brother Sonny (James Caan), and quiet middle brother Fredo (John Cazale) must take control over the family business while he is gone, and rely on Don Vito´s new consigliere Tom Hagen´s (the always great Robert Duvall) and end the conspiracy bestowed upon them. The story is perfectly vowen, marvelously executed violence scenes. It´s a movie that must be seen by any movie fan, this is as perfect as movies become. No different is The Godfather Part II, even possibly better than the first one, this movie however is longer and is split up as two stories intercutting in parts, one showing the life and rise of younger Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro) and the other his son Michael tightening his grip on his family business, alienating his wife kay (Diane Keaton) in the 1950´s. The third and weaker of the Godfather movies but not all that bad, involves middle-aged Michael legititimizing his earlier crime business, while trying to win back his ex wife Kay.

The weakest performances come from George Hamilton as Michael´s new lawyer B.J. and Coppola´s own daughter Sofia as Vincent´s cousin and lover, which isn´t to say Sofia is all bad but doesn´t really have the experience for this pivotal role. The Video transfers aren´t all that top notch showing some grain but never-the-less show flawless detail and color resolution, the audio transfers are deliverd in powerful detail and gives the subwoofer a run for its money.

Legend has it however, that the cat came onto the set by accident and Brando  (with the reflex of a Willie Mays) knew just what to do.
When Tom is kidnapped  he is told ""If I wanted to kill you'd be dead alreardy""   we are reminded that murder is a natural as breathing.From the time the undertaker begs for justice until the time Kay sees Micheal for a ruthless killer  we see acting as good as the Sey Hey Kid could catch.  To maintain this quality for a few sences is an achievement.  To maintain it in every sence for well over two hours is an offer no one should refuse."

The great Marlon Brando ad-libbed the films most important scene, that in the garden with his grandson, as the Don dies in peace, ironic for a man that lived such a violent life. The moody cinematography of Gordon Willis is the best ever caught on film. And the score by Nino Rota (I know the Academy didn't believe it belonged entirely to Rota, but who cares what the Academy thinks?) is a classic. The rest of the cast, which includes Robert Duvall, James Caan, John Cazale, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda, Richard Castellano, Richard Bright, Alex Rocco, Richard Conte, John Marley and Sterling Hayden is in top form. Every film and television show about the mafia since this one has borrowed or outright stolen from this film. It is a story of profound depth, an American tragedy, told in three acts, and this, the first act, is the best. And yet at its root, it is a very simple story, as Don Corleone prepares his children for the lives they will have to live and the world they will have to live in. It can be summed up as family values, mafia style."

My family says I like Part 1 more than Part 2 because Marlon Brando was in it (yes, partly, but he's my favorite actor), but the story was so much better.

It´s not certainly the only mob movie neither mob movie masterpiece. But, there is the fine balance between poetry and crime, honor and reckless vengeance. There are the unforgettable lines at the precise time that make this film so believable, so close to everyone that makes you fall in love with Don Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone.

And what would America be without it's greatest cinema-piece? It would be a nation lost of entertainment, a nation without a character as undeniable as Marlon Brando's Godfather. Without him, there would be a missing link to every actor in the history of cinema minus the few previous such as Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine from Casablanca. The performance of he convinces anyone that Don Vito Corleone is truly alive. Not only alive in the film,  but alive as an actual person who speaks to us in volumes, a man who's moral guidelines and love for his family make him a respectable role model, even though he is the head of a mafia family. Don Corleone reaches out to all that see this movie and he is instantly respected as a person of honor, one who we know is of high power, yet is more a democrat rather than a fascist like other corrupt crime lords. Sonny, his son is in fact, fascist in a manner of speech and it shows when he must take over the business. Tragically, Michael the youngest son of the Corleone family is molded into the form of ""zero tolerance"" throughout the picture. The film really isn't about the Mafia; it's about family. The most important thing in The Godfather isn't the rise of power or the loss of it, only how much the other people in your life mean to you.
Many movies inevitably become boring and have scenes that are meant to be remembered but are easily forgettable. The Godfather never becomes boring. It hooks you the minute it begins and keeps you attached. Impressive for nearly a three-hour movie. An undertaker gives a speech to convince Don Corleone to avenge his daughter against the decadent hoods that attempted to rape her. From there on, the movie continues as a sweeping epic. Death strikes many times in this movie; all the moments of this are breathtaking and at many times, heart-wrenching. I sympathize for the many characters in The Godfather that meet with tragedy because they are so lovable. The 1972 classic takes you inside of the crime syndicate; a place I am oddly enough, happy to be. I feel like a member of the Corleone family every time I watch. Prior to viewing, I must admit that this world wasn't my most desired destination. Many parts and lines are memorable in this movie. What's so amazing is that most of them are back to back, which is a trademark of director Francis Ford Coppola. Most of his films achieve continuous scenes, ones that are embedded in our minds forever. For further proof, see Apocalypse Now or The Godfather Part II.The Godfather is however, better than it's sequel. Even though the second film may have a more powerful and haunting conclusion and may also have more of a meaning, it still doesn't dig as deep into your soul like the original. Why is the first movie better you ask? Because The Godfather is in this one. Not Robert De Niro's version, but Marlon Brando's. To attempt to replace Brando is a ridiculous waste of time. Brando is The Godfather. No one else can compete with that."

What is surprising as anything is that two years it was followed by Part II which is just as good (and then 20 years later and money-grabbing, dull and unnecessary third film). The first time I watched this film, I thought it was very good but overly long. But the second time I watched it, it didn't seem overly long at all, but beautifully detailed and concise - despite being nearly three hours long. I didn't find myself become bored, because the remarkable thing about this film is that almost every line, ever scene adds to the story or unfolding the characters, and their interaction with each other. The acting is believable, the direction is superb, and cinematography excellent.As well as all this, the film avoids cliches and over-dramatising deaths, but instead shows the Italian culture and strong importance of relations with your family. The differemt characters seem to perfectly gel. Micheal who changes from being relatively uninvolved ('a citizen') to heading the family, Sonny -overly volatile, Fredo - not clever enough (he's more involved in the 2nd film), and Tom - the level headed, sensible lawyer, who doesn't let his emotions run away with him like the others. My only (slight) criticism of the film, is that the Scilly scenes didn't run as smoothly as the rest of the film. Although it was interesting to see where family orginates from (again the 2nd film covers this more), Micheals falling in love and then his newly-weds' death seem a little unrealistic. Well in didn't make as well sense to me in a way.In summary this is a brilliantly detailed and enjoyable film, if not as 'entertaining' as Armaggedon (supposedly) or other rubbish.  I can see how this film wouldn't be for all tastes, but anyone interested in the more 'classic' style which people remember for years to come, as well as the storyline, this is a MUST see. Also note its a good idea to watch Godfather Part II shortly afterwards, while Part I is still fresh in the mind, as they link together brillantly. 10/10"

The actors' portrayals, while very strong throughout the cast, frequently overshadow what they are talking about.  I tend to think that the story is usually the most important and interesting part of films, but here it is put on the backburner by, dare I say, too rich character-development. Actually, is that what it was?  I come away from it without any true understanding of Michael's motivations or concept of morals, or why he chose to totally ignore them in the pursuit of power.  I often felt that Don Corleone himself, who is not in the film as much as one might expect, is also hidden behind his own famous mannerisms and the reputation that goes along with being the Godfather.  Having said that, the last hour, with Michael as the new head of the family, finally gains a focus and becomes interesting.  The cross-cutting of the christening and the murders was perfectly masterful and thrilling.  However, how the film morphed into Michael's story (and how he himself morphed into the cold blooded killer) is rather abrupt and unconvincing, though I am grateful for the change in tone.Most importantly, it is inferior to GoodFellas, and thus can't even stake a claim as the best film of its genre."

(eg. the flashback of Michael telling his family about him joining the army)4-the music which creates an amazing and authentic atmosphere.

Coppola, despite a shaky career of hits and misses, created a structural story so memorable and unmatched that it must have the three hour length to fully develop into a nuanced story, setting the stage for its successors.  And I challenge anyone to find a more memorable screen performance than Marlon Brando.

Godfather II is the best sequel ever made, and I just don't think you can really say anything about this movie until you've seen that one.  Really, you have to look at the first one as the rise of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), and the second as his fall.  Despite the fact that he doesn't lose power, he loses almost everything else.  You don't really get much character development of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) in this movie, because it's all being saved for the sequel (in the form of Robert De Niro).  The way that the two are intertwined is just absolutely brilliant. As a movie by itself, The Godfather is still a masterpiece.  One of the things that I think makes it so compelling is the blurring of the line between good and evil.  Just about everyone in this movie is a bad guy. But there are good bad guys and bad bad guys, and we're on the outside trying to decide which ones we want to root for.  We end up cheering on the Corleones, the focal point of the movie, but it's very reluctant as the climactic scene unfolds.  I found myself right there with Kay (Diane Keaton) at the end, torn between what I know to be right and what has to be done for survival. I cannot imagine this movie being any better.  It's fascinating, and the sequel does not do anything to diminish that sense of awe.  It's a timeless classic about the battle between good and evil.  But does evil really win out?

With apologies to those of Italian heritage, I think the tragedy of the Corleones is less a matter of ethnicity than their ruination by blood which is set in motion by two evils: greed and a lust for power. The film is one which sets off the family or clan, [the neighborhood as victim] against the larger, unforgiving American society. The characters are wonderfully realized and splendidly acted. They appear as if drawn to life for the first time. The sinister atmosphere of the film, from its great opening sequence to its frightening close, is a nearly three-hours-long treatise on the disintegration of a family. The Corleones are revealed as equal parts melting kindness and merciless vengeance. The Godfather's turning point is Captain McCloskey's unnecessary assault upon Michael. The meanness of the violent act unhinged the human ideal in the Don's young son. From Michael's understandable love and need to protect his helpless father in an unguarded, creepy hospital emerged his irrevocable decision to cast away any desire to become successful in the eyes of legitimate society. The slow, sure gestation of the plan to assassinate both Captain McCloskey and Virgil Solozzo is one of the major rewards for anyone who loves this film. The seamless transition of Michael Corleone from a patriotic, dutiful, obedient son into a cruelly vengeful and malignant weapon is terrifying portrait. The title of the movie applies to both Don Vito and to Don Michael, with the son slowly eroding the warm and loving family, painstaking built by the father, into a loveless, cheerless collection of individuals adrift on a sea of loneliness and treachery."

Even today these films still have a great raw power no matter how certain elements may be dated. And with White Heat Warner proved they could still come up with a truly great gangster film in the late 40's .But when The Godfather came along in 1972 it blew away all the opposition.The hype had really gone into overdrive by the time it reached Ireland in the Summer of 1973. Although it was the film you had to see at the time, for boys of my generation, Marlon Brando was yesterday's man.Clint Eastwood was our idol, with the spaghetti Westerns and Dirty Harry.And, to be honest, the wedding scene, the scene with Brando's pottering around in the garden with his grandson, and the scenes of family banter did seem to me, then, to get in the way of the undoubtedly brilliant set-pieces of violence and pad out the film unnecessarily. Seeing the sequel two years later largely helped me to confirm my original view that the original was more a star vehicle to revive Brando's career and I went along with the perceived opinion that the later film was the masterpiece of the series.Almost 30 years later, having greatly expanded my vocabulary of World Cinema, The Godfather still ranks in my Top 10 of all time,(and I can't see that ranking will ever change) whereas the sequel, while I admire it as a great film, would be some way short.What marks the film out as particularly special include many of the features that I found boring as a teenager: the family relationships; the jostling for positions in the family and mafia hierarchy, but especially the carefully plotted change in Michael's character. Has Pacino ever been better? Like Jack Nicholson, he was at his best in his early films, before the fame thing went to his head. And Coppola undoubtedly kept his performance and character on  a tight rein in contrast to Part 2, where there may just have been a touch of caricature.The great scenes were masterfully directed: the toll-booth assassination; the various violent deaths, Michael's cafe killings; the shocking church murders, but, overall, its the pacing and  development of the film, and Coppola's masterly handling of the actors which will make this one run and run. And I haven't even mentioned Nino Rota's spellbinding music.Of course Coppola has mostly disappointed since then, (although I will always maintain that Rumble Fish is a minor gem, )one acknowledged masterpiece is more than most directors could even dream about.Cagney at his peak would have been proud to be in this one.

Acting is top-notch. Direction cannot receive comments enough to describe how good it is. The story is one of the best ever. I mean... what more could anyone want?I am very sad a lot of people that voted for American Beauty made it look like as good as this one. I mean... we cannot compare both movies, can we? If this one drops one rank because of pityful American Beauty, i will be very sad. And I just can imagine anyone giving this one a 1. 7 at least. Not 1 or 2 or 3.

Brando is forever enshrined by his performance as Don Vito head of the powerful Corleone crime family.  Al Pacino stars in his breakthrough role as the Don's son Michael, who is ironically transplanted from war hero to mafia chief during a pivotal existential murder scene.  It is a comment on the fallibility of the American dream.  How every good boy has the capacity for bad.  Every character resonates with authenticity.   Every subplot relates back to the theme of redemption through dedication to family.  THE GODFATHER above all raises moral questions about how far one should go for their family.  It is a tribute to an age long before organized crime had been washed away by drugs and rock and roll.  When loyalty was ensured through family connections, and the power of the mafia was as strong as the national government.  A film that is truly epic in scope, and all encompassing in wisdom.

Goodfellas comes pretty close, but The Godfather and Godfather II are the mold that Goodfellas was made from.I first saw this film in 1983, 11 years after it was released.  I'd heard about it, but VCRs weren't quite common household items back then.  I had a cinema class in high school, and to view this film, the teachers got us out of all our classes for a day and showed The Godfather on the big screen in the school auditorium.  So I was fortunate to see it for the first time in a crowded theatre on a big screen.Afterwards, the entire class asked for the movie to be shown again in place of one of the other films we were due to see.  They offered to play it after school in the evening for us instead.  The whole class turned out the second time plus another 100 to 150 tag-alongs.This movie is full of fantastic performances from top to bottom.

989,6468,False,0.07653670332714231,"""The Godfather"" is a visceral achievement in moviemaking and has a rightful place near the top of any list of the greatest films ever made. It seizes your attention, doesn't let go and takes you down the road promised to immigrants to America -- before taking a turn in which we confront the prejudices, mistrust and other roadblocks to the realization of their dreams, and how they went on to create success on their terms. But I have to put it near the top, not AT the top. That honor, on my list, belongs to ""The Godfather Part II,"" for a reason that it's hard to fault Coppola for. In ""The Godfather,"" I found Michael to be too far outside the family at the beginning of the movie. While not renouncing his father, Sonny or their enterprise, Michael seems to be more of an observer in an Army uniform with his white-bread girlfriend nearby than a family member PLANNING to immerse himself in the life his father and brother have chosen. Obviously Michael is drawn closer to his family as it becomes threatened with, then targeted by, violence. This is understandable but, to me, not foreshadowed by the life outside the family that he had chosen a few years earlier and seemed to be comfortable with. Of course, ""Part II"" gives a much fuller picture of how Michael got to where he was in running the enterprise, and heading the family. But we already know all we need to know about his motives and choices -- courtesy of ""The Godfather."" This deeper, more realized character of Michael in ""Part II"" is the reason I rate it ahead of ""The Godfather"" -- but not by much."

The Godfather is the definative story of the Mafia and it's bid for legitimacy and respect from Political allies and Law Enforcement groups eager to sympathize in order to capitalize. While the show is informing us, or rather reminding us of time honoured liaisons between the law makers and the law breakers in mid 20th Century America, with scenes of Movie Producers waking up and finding parts of a horses' anatomy sharing satin sheets, employees of the Don getting garrotted in public bars and  front seats of company vehicles, the hazards of stopping your car at toll booths, and Police Captains choking over bits of lead during their meal, we learn also of the significence of that well worn cliche..........'Give him an offer he can't refuse.'  Yeah..... bloodthirsty stuff indeed, but apparently stuff we all enjoy watching, particularly when it's directed by guys like Francis Coppola and embellished with stars like Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton and Robert Duvall.

Although an organized crime family is depicted, the real story is about family, and love.  Michael's struggle is well documented, and as he attempts to stay away from the family business, his love for his father causes him to become a criminal as he attends to his father in the Don's greatest time of need.As it turns out, Michael proved to be the ideal choice for the next Don, and now the story begins to unfold.

Of all the movies in the seventies only two can fill the classic criteria and they share similar titles. Godfather 1 and 2.People can argue about Jaws and Star Wars but those movies scripts were rubbish. They were all about spectacle. No movie could compare to the quality of the Godfather. In fact the Godfather blows its closest rival out of the water: its closest rival being its sequel.The Godfather is unlike any movie I ever saw. It begins with a great scene as a man comes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) to ask for his help in hurting a guy that has raped his daughter. It is Brando's daughters wedding day and the man who has come to the Godfather never gave Corleone any help before. Brando refuses. It is a brilliant scene introducing us to the world of the Corleone's. We see how ruthless the Godfather can be but we also see his loyalty to his family. It is a scene that will be hard to match in cinema history but Coppola goes on to deliver even more spellbinding scenes. This is the beauty of the Godfather - every single scene is fabulous.

This is the only flawless material this world has ever made.  The script could not be better even if Shakespeare wrote it.  The direction could not be better if Spielberg directed it.  The acting could not be better if a gun was held up to the head of each actor.  Marlon Brando gives the single greatest performance by an actor this millenium, winning the best actor oscar hands down.  It just goes to show the entire world no actor has ever been better (On the Waterfront, A Streetcar Named Desire, Viva Zapata...)  Al Pacino was also stunning in his early career and showed signs of becoming the best actor of his generation (which he is, just barely ahead of De Niro and Hoffman).  James Caan and Robert Duvall also put in stellar performances which garnered oscar nominations for them both.  The Godfather should be studied in school to show what the partnership of perfection and complete mastery can do for a picture.  This movie is not at all matched by it's sequel or any other movie for that matter.  I would give my left arm to go see it on theater (c'mon i can't give my right arm i need that to press play and watch it at home).  No accomplishment by Da Vinci in innovation or Van Gogh in art can match what the Godfather has done for cinema.  Nearly number one on every single famous list in the world its an inspiration.

1016,6495,False,0.1393399757765035,"Throughout history, well-intentioned men have committed many horrible crimes in the name of their mother countries.  THE GODFATHER is about a well-intentioned man named Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) who learns to commit horrible crimes in the name of his family.The Godfather is Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who heads one of the most powerful crime families in New York.  He has three sons: hot-tempered Santino (James Caan), weak-willed Fredo (John Cazale), and Michael. ""Michael,"" significantly, is the only Anglicized name of the three.  Michael is the only son who fought for the Americans in World War II, and the only one who wants nothing to do with the family crime business.  He is something of an outsider to his family.But Michael is devoted to his father.  And when Vito is severely wounded in an attempted assassination by drug dealer Virgil ""the Turk"" Sollozzo, who thinks Vito's heir apparent Santino will be readier to deal with him, then Michael saves his life.  Later, Michael murders the Turk and his hired police bodyguard, knowing that he will have to flee to Sicily for breaking the unwritten truce between the police and the Mafia.The saga of Michael's rise to head the Corleone family is one of the most fascinating stories ever told on screen.  It is hard to tell a good story about evil, but Coppola succeeds, principally because he shows the sincere devotion to family that lies behind the characters' deeds.  Michael is slowly corrupted into a cold-hearted killer, not by laziness or indifference or any other vice, but by his defining virtue: his love for his father and brothers!  Likewise, Santino comes to grief as a direct result of his only redeeming feature, his devotion to his sister.  This tragic irony suffuses the film.  The viewer thus can forgive the characters somewhat for their crimes, because the life they have been born into gives them a choice between violent crime and abandoning their loved ones.Nino Rota's sad, haunting score is superb, and his Siciliana theme is beautiful and tender.  The supporting performances are superb, particularly Abe Vigoda and Richard Castellano as the Godfather's tough but genial caporegimes, Robert Duvall as the ""consigliere"" or Mafia lawyer, and Al Lettieri as Sollozzo.  Luca Brasi unfortunately disappears too quickly; his role was more fleshed out in Puzo's original novel.Enter a world where murder is ""not personal.  It's strictly business.""
