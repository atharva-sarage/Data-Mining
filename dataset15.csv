22808,True,"SPOILERS Three years after ""Star Wars"", creator George Lucas released the second part of his trilogy. Giving scripting credits to Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasden, as well as directing to Irvin Kershner, Lucas made his smartest ever decision and as a result was able to release the finest film of the trilogy by a mile. Considerably darker and more mature than it's predecessor, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a masterpiece of modern film. It is an intense, powerful, entertaining film with the ultimate cinema twist and with a script worthy of it's potential.After the events of the first film, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) are now members of the rebel alliance. Hidden on a frozen planet, the rebels hide from the domineering glow of the Empire. All is not well however as the evil Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) is on his way to find them.Easily the best of the trilogy, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" has so much going for it. A wonderful plot, an equally good script with some brilliant lines (even actor Harrison Ford joining in with a line or two of his own) and special effects to match, this film is a glowing example of why people love the trilogy so much.Since George Lucas passed on the major responsibilities for this film, we are given a more professional, well made film for our attention and Lucas's vision is better off for it. With it's recent remastering, it is also the only film in the trilogy to not be damaged by Lucas' tampering. Extra images are added, graphics are honed, but nothing major is changed. As a result the film appears to us to be no different from it's original self.Darker and more mature as well, this sequel is better than the original ""Star Wars"" because it isn't so black and white. Presenting the evil Darth Vader as a more balanced individual, we don't quite have the confused Vader of the final chapter, but we are beginning to get signs that he isn't quite as we expected.This second part also gives us the finest performance ever by one of the universes most important characters. Still a rubber puppet with bendy ears, Jedi Master Yoda is introduced in this film as a creature of wit and intelligence. Voiced by Frank Oz, Yoda is brilliant because of his lines. Legendarily possessing of an obsession for splitting sentences up and rehashing them together, Yoda very often speaks normally throughout this film. Occasionally demonstrating his penchant for bad English, he does make a few minor errors, but ultimately it is up to the later scripts of George Lucas to corrupt Yoda's style and turn this wonderful character into an annoying figure of fun.There's no real way to fault ""The Empire Strikes Back"". The finest part of the original trilogy, this film is amazing because it is professionally done. Nobody would ever deny that George Lucas did something wonderful when he thought up ""Star Wars"", but unfortunately for a lot of the films, Lucas always insisted on too much control. A dire writer of scripts, Lucas can destroy his films by making them infuriating to watch. In this part though, Lucas didn't get involved and as a result, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a masterpiece in it's own right."
22809,True,"(Note: This review contains some spoilers.)Movie novelty quickly wears thin, which is why so many sequels pale in comparison to their originals. ""Star Wars: Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"" is the best of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, darker and deeper and even more powerful than the first film. Granted, the original pioneered an endless saga of imitators and somewhat imaginative knock-offs, and is still one of the greatest films ever made, but ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a tiny inch ahead in the race.It is the dark middle chapter in an almost perfect trilogy, crammed full with imagination and special effects. It is simply one of the most visionary movies of all time, which is rare for a sequel -- any sequel -- especially in the case of a sci-fi film. Just take a look at ""Predator 2"" for an example of an idea running out of steam, or a director who cannot cope with his script.The film generally picks up where the last left off: Luke (Mark Hamill) saved the day by blowing up the Death Star, the heroes were awarded with medals by the princess (Carrie Fisher), and peace was temporarily restored. But Darth Vader (voice of James Earl Jones) is still alive, and the Emperor's fury grows stronger as Luke begins his Jedi training under the help of Yoda. Meanwhile, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Leia flee to Cloud City to escape an attack from the empire, where they are taken under the wing of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), an old pal of Han's who is secretly working for Vader, somewhat against his own will.The movie is strong in its morals and Biblical metaphors, just as the original. Luke is the savior, Calrissian could be considered the equivalent of Judas, Han Solo is one of Luke's good disciples and Vader represents pure evil. And of course, there's the truly iconic line, ""I am your father,"" that is relevant to the devil, who -- according to the scriptures -- was an angel before being cast into the bowels of hell and becoming Lucifer.
Lucas admittedly used these various metaphors to strike a nerve in the subconscious of his viewers. Like all good fables, of fantasy or reality, ""Star Wars"" is a trilogy that relates to just about everyone, in one form or another, and is -- at its roots -- a story we are all very familiar with. It is the ever-familiar notion of good-vs. -evil at its core that helps propel these movies into the hearts of many. Yes, ""Star Wars"" is the quintessential nerd's film, engulfed in an entirely different dimension, but the film's bad rap for this is undeserved -- it's still a wonderful story, and you don't have to be a die-hard fan to appreciate its fine points (and it has many).One of the most popular legends (and misconceptions) regarding the ""Star Wars"" phenomenon is that George Lucas helmed the entire Star Wars trilogy, when in fact he only directed the first and wrote the screenplay for all three combined. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is directed by Irvin Kirshner, who also delivered us the disappointing ""RoboCop 2."" How could one sequel be so great, and the other so bad? Simple: Kirshner's darkness in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" had a point, and a high value. In ""RoboCop 2,"" it was just excessive and silly, not to mention totally unnecessary. What Paul Verhoeven was able to do with the original ""RoboCop"" was something not many films can accomplish, and Kirshner tried to add on to this with a darker narrative, which only ended in a frustratingly empty motion picture.""The Empire Strikes Back"" has a point amidst the action, and is the most important of all three ""Star Wars"" movies. It has the famous introduction of the creature Yoda, who sits tucked away in his hut on a swamp planet, at first startling Luke with his strange features, and then with his subtle wisdom. It is Yoda who trains Luke in the ways of the Jedi, and eventually leads him towards his destination: The showdown with Vader, when the infamous secret is finally revealed.The movie is expertly crafted, both in terms of a a narrative and literal context. From beginning to end it is darker, fiercer and more powerful than the original film, which is not an easy feat. All trilogies have their dark areas, and this is usually the middle chapter (""Back to the Future Part II"" is a good example), yet in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" the darkness seems very appropriate given the material. It is a film that dwells long and hard on betrayal, murder, revenge, and unrecoverable mistakes. By the end of the movie, we know what Luke is feeling: There is still much to be done, despite an overwhelming emotional downpour of attachment and confusion. For us, as an audience, we know everything must come to an end within the next installment. For Luke, it could be an eternity of struggle. But we all know there will be an end to the epic saga, and we have always known this, ever since we first caught a glimpse of a younger, more innocent Luke working for his uncle on that deserted planet, so many years ago, when he could only dream of having adventures in other galaxies far, far away...5/5 stars.John Ulmer"
22810,True,"While the Titanic made all the rich people (with the exception of Molly Brown and Rose) automatically uncaring, snobby, and thoughtless just because they were rich and needed a couple of villains for the story, The Empire Strikes Back did not portray ""the villain"" in a completely evil light. Sympathy is induced when we see the back of Darth Vader's scarred and pasty head.  When he tells Luke of their blood relationship, some feeling is allowed to creep in, telling us that he is not just some maniacal killing machine, but a human, fallen from grace, yet able to retain some sense of love, however twisted it may be."
22811,True,"''Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back '' is my favorite one from all the star war series.Things are getting more and more complicated for the Rebels.Spite of the fact that the Death Star was destroyed, the Imperial troops had success expelling the Rebels from their secret base, and now they are being hunted in all galaxy. The new secret base is localized in Hoth, a very cold world even for the native animals. Darth Vader wants to find Luke at any cost, and now he sent many remote probes to find him in all space. Luke is attacked by a big animal and almost dies, by stays lost in the ice. He sees the ghost of Obi Wan Kenobi talking with him, and he says that Luke needs to go to a system called Dangoba, where Yoda will teach and explain to him all the steps to become a Jedi. Han Solo goes after Luke and they both are saved by their rebel team.The system Hoth is discovered by the Empire(since it should not have any human form living in there) and consequently the Rebel Base. Darth Vader decides to attack the Rebels by the surface,and the Rebels really stay in disadvantage. Han,Leia,C3pO and Chewbacca escapes from Hoth,but after many attacks from the Imperial troops and even asteroids fields, they arrive in the Cloud city that Lando,an old friend of Han,rules.Luke goes with R2 to Dangoba,and there he finds Yoda. The problem is, Yoda does not want to teach him how to become a Jedi,since he finds Luke extremely impatient, old to be trained and also with many anger inside of him,like his father Anakin. Obi Wan tries to change Yoda's mind, but only when Luke promises to really gives his best that Yoda accepts the challenge.The Emperor talks to Vader about a disturbance in the force that comes from Luke Skywalker. He finally says that Luke is son of Anakin and that Luke should never be trained as a Jedi,because of the risk in destroying the siths,that are very high. But Vader has other plans: He always imagined that his offspring died when Padme died, and now he thinks about making Luke a sith,to they both rule the galaxy together and also kill the Emperor.In the city of the clouds, Lando betrays Han and gives them all to Vader.It's all a trap to take Luke that Vader did, and while he tortures Han, Lukes see the vision of his friends suffering,and gave up his training. Yoda alerts him that the risk of turning to the dark side is high, and that he should not stop his training, but Luke is so worried with his friends that he cannot think about anything else. Vader call the award hunters and Boba Fett(the clone of Jango Fett,remember?)is the one who takes Han Solo to Jabba,to win a big prize.We are now in a risky situation, where Lukes needs to confront his dad without be tainted to the dark side, and someone needs to help Han,Chewbacca,Leia and C3po.Ps: *In this movie we can see the first demonstrations that Leia and Han likes each other,and when Leia wants to let Han with jealous and kisses Luke is kind of a funny moment. Another nice moment with Leia, is when we see the connection between her and Luke, when he has his hand cut and is in a dangerous situation after fighting with Vader.*I really like the big Imperial robots called 'walkers': I think they are one of the most impressive artilleries the Empire has."
22812,True,"I am A Star Wars fan, always have been. The difference was the direction in this film there were standards set. The Imperial Theme is one of the most well known themes and has been repeatedly parodied although it has kept respectable as time wears on. Darth Vader is given more than barking orders in ""A new Hope"" Boba Fett the most feared and universally loved Bounty Hunter even though he had only one line in the first three series makes his debut but actions speak louder than words. David Prowses body Language as the dark lord mixed with James Earl Jones voice is iconic. The budding romance between Han and Leia was a surprise when I first saw this. I thought for sure Luke would get it on with her, but Lucas had other plans which I was really happy about.The suspense is really built and when I was seven years old watching this film I hung on every word. I still do. The real difference is the direction and the attention to detail. The asteroid scene was new. John Williams thematics set the cornerstone of the film and a relentless chase through the stars for Luke Skywalker by a driven Dark lord is answered at the climax. The screenplay is more mature than the original and any of the others following. It is what is left unsaid that carries this film and makes it highly re-watchable.I'm going to give this film a nine it still excites me and is the real beginning of the story and for all it's worth I appreciate the prelude to it as well. This film delivers the emotional punch that has captured fans for decades and cemented a niche in the industry. Enjoy"
22813,True,"This movie is my all-time favorite. From the massive battles, to the surprising twist that even this day I get tingle from. I can't stress this enough that Empire Strikes Back is one of the greatest movies to be released. I remember first watching this when I was not older than 3 years of age, and gasping during the biggest reveal in movie history. If people say they hate Star Wars, then they obviously: A. Only saw the prequels (or)B. Are hiding the fact that this movie is a masterpiece.If you go any longer without watching the greatest trilogy of all time, then you are missing out."
22814,True,"And I've seen some great films. However, within this one it's the culmination of both fortuitous events and the craft and skill of everyone involved that makes this the best film of all time.If you start with the script, because many people leave this detail out, you realise how well crafted the dialogue is. This is no accident and arguably the key to this success was the work by Leigh Brackett, the woman that was also partly responsible for the script to the Bogey classic ""The Big Sleep"". I've often said that it you place Han and Leia's script in empire and compare the sparkling repartee between them and Marlow and Rutledge you could almost switch them between films (Those are harsh words to throw at a man, especially when he's walking out of your bedroom and sorry sweetheart, I haven't time for anything else, in particular).Then of course the luck factor kicks in. Bad luck at first with Mark Hamill's terrible bike accident which had to be explained with the wampa attack, which in turn leads to the scene where we see how Luke's powers are first coming along. Then arguably the best piece of lateral thinking. The obvious jedi master would be 6 feet tall and virtually indestructible, and rather than do that, they make Yoda anything but, they went the other way and created one of cinema's best realised fake characters. In Empire, Yoda is masterfully done and every scene with him is like a moment with a treasured Grandparent whose wisdom is strange but unquestionable. This is Yoda's film and is fantastic for it.The John williams score in this one is breathtaking, key moments, include the lifting of the X-wing and the confrontation between Lando and vader, so subtle, but so perfect.Finally the effects, the light sabre duel is arguably the best one ever put on film, as Luke's quick but not perfect yet, going up against a Jedi Warrior whose powers are second to only 2 others in the galaxy. Awesome, and as for the revelation, I thought he was lying when I was 10 years old, it is almost too unbelievable, but believable it is.First three aren't a patch and this one is George's masterpiece.10/10 Mikey B"
22815,True,"The best of the Star Wars series? Without a doubt. What makes this movie so great is the fact that it is not like other movies, leaving you with all the hope you need at the end. In this film, however, the only hope is that all of the main characters are still alive at the end.Another thing that places it above the others is its ending. The ""I am your father"" scene is no doubt the most famous single scene in film history, as well as one of the most shocking twists in any film ever made. Jones' delivery during the scene, as well as Hammil's reaction to it, only makes the scene better.And, of course, we can't forget the introduction of everyone's favorite Jedi master, Yoda. The jump he makes from strangely hilarious (""MINE! MINE!"") to calm and serious is very believable, unlike most films, where major jumps in personality are not believable at all. His unique speech is also interesting.In closing, one of the best films ever made. Thank you, George Lucas and Irvin Kershner, for bringing one of the best movies of all time."
22816,True,"In many ways, The Empire Strikes Back is the perfect sequel. But before I begin, let me get one thing out of the way. This is NOT the best Star Wars film of all time. That honour lies with the original, which it always will. There's a multitude of great scenes here, but I can and will argue that every one of them is derived from the original.In case the original Star Wars lulled you into a false sense of security - the Death Star is destroyed, Tarkin is dead and Vader is lost in space - Empire Strikes Back (the name says it all) opens with the iconic Battle of Hoth, where the rebels are once again on the run from an Empire with superior numbers and firepower. Everything about this battle sets the mood of Empire - most of which is spent on the run. If your heart isn't beating faster than usual when Vader is walking up to the Millennium Falcon, then you're straight up lying.There's no point wasting space talking about the performances in Empire Strikes Back, because Hamill, Fisher, Ford, Daniel and the actors behind Vader are just as good in this film as they were in the original. Ford and Fisher's on screen chemistry is what every movie couple aspires to be - it is not only believable but obvious that the Princess falls for the scoundrel Solo. Frank Oz joins the cast as the delightful Yoda, and his performance is perfect both in Yoda's wisest and most comedic moments. See also Billy Dee Williams, who became one of the franchise's most beloved characters in such a small amount of time. Williams' easy smile and commanding delivery shows us very clearly why he was in the conversation for the role of Han Solo.The reason that Empire Strikes Back is the perfect sequel is that it delves deeper into the parts we wanted to know more about. Yoda warns us that Luke is not right to be a Jedi, and then we watch Luke make the very mistakes Yoda was warning him about. Vader is built into an incredible villain in this movie - he knows Luke is his son and he still maims him. One of the things I loved in this movie was the similarity of Vader's approach to Admiral Ozell and Captain Needa's failures. Ozell is a buffoon and Needa an honest and upfront man willing to accept responsibility, and they both meet the same fate. Its a small thing, but it says so much about Vader's lack of empathy.Kershner is a very skilled director, probably the best in the franchise. Some of my favourite directed scenes include the devastating duel between Luke and Vader, where it is immediately obvious that Luke is out of his depth, and the incredible scene in which Vader's human head is revealed to the audience. A facial expression or change in body language is enough to speak volumes to the audience.I'm not in love with Empire Strikes Back. I find Hoth's Yeti, the giant asteroid worm, and the community's bizarre obsession with Boba Fett to be rather annoying. I also found Hoth, Dagobah and Bespin to be relatively flat and uninspired worlds by Star Wars standards. But they are all such tiny things in what is obviously an incredible film - the film that gave me my name.''Luke, I am your father.''"
22817,True,"Although Star Wars Episode IV was groundbreaking, as a kid I always loved to see Star Wars Episode V, as basically it took all the things developed in the first movie, and built on them to create something 1,000 times better like a good sequel should, rather than just retracing the steps of the previous film. Although my family didn't own Episode V, my brother's friend did, and surprised me when I was about 6 years old by bringing over Episode V in secret, and I adored every last minute of it!So what's the deal? After the destruction of the Death Star in the previous film, the Empire gained its revenge, and the Rebel Alliance was scattered across the Galaxy in a bitter chase. Now on the ice planet of Hoth, Jedi Luke Skywalker is told in a vision to go to the planet of Dagobah to learn from a mystical Jedi Master known as Yoda. Meanwhile, the Empire determines their location, and after a vicious fight between the ill-equipped Rebels and the Empire's AT-AT Walkers, the group must flee the planet, with Han Solo and Chewbacca taking Princess Leia and C-3PO in a desperate bid to escape the Imperial blockade aboard the Millennium Falcon, whilst Luke and R2D2 journey to the swamp world of Dagobah to find the mysterious Jedi, all while being pursued by the vengeful Dark Lord, Darth Vader, obsessed with turning Luke to the Dark Side.As I said, rather than retreading the first movie like many sequels do, the Empire Strikes Back takes all the elements from the first movie, the fantastic models, the gripping action, the story, the characters, and expands on them. The development of the characters, such as romantic relationship that you can genuinely believe between Han and the Princess is established, Luke is trained in the art of a Jedi, being able to control and channel the Force, and Darth Vader's truly evil powers are built upon, now being a ruthless leader of a frightened Army.The story is also one that throws you on so many loops. I've watched this movie a million times so nothing surprises me, but if you're watching for the first time, there are many things about this film that will give you a shock, or take you by surprise. I of course wont name them, but you'll see what I mean.The action sequences have also been massively improved since the last movie. Whilst the battle above the Death Star, though long, was impressive, the battle against the AT-AT's in the snow with the stop-motion movement of the Walkers and the fight of the Snowspeeders is just so good it's practically real. Every individual piece is manipulated and choreographed to perfection to create a truly awesome fight scene. The lightsaber battles too have been made more energetic, and take place on a wider range of locations, as well as the mastery of the Force and powers that it entails being developed heavily.Overall, I consider this both my best Science-Fiction film, but also my best film of all time. A film that even today has me hooked, and continues to be the awe and inspiration of so many even 35 years after it first hit the big screen. I recommend this movie to everyone, because it appeals to just about everyone!"
22818,True,"**Warning! Spoiler Information Inside!**After Star Wars (1977) changed film history , the movie of the year was given to Woody Allen for Annie Hall (1977). Go Figure. Undaunted ,by the clear resistance to change Hollywood insiders posed , George Lucas pushed forward and released The Empire Strikes Back (1980).After the swift destruction of the Death Star , the Empire is in full pursuit ,after discovering the rebels new base the fight is on. Our hero,Luke Skywalker is now an essential component to the rebellion , however he remains unaware how key he is to his movement. Much is at stake as Skywalker (Mark Hamill),faces the ultimate evil in Darth Vader and learns the horrible truth.Fantastic direction (Irvin Kershner) and dramatic writing are further enhanced by the increased acting chops of returner Harrison Ford (Han Solo), and support from newcomers Billy Dee Williams (Lando Calrissian)and Kenneth Colley (Capt./Adm. Piett). It goes with out much statement that the effects are top notch. The flow is sheer perfection ,the framing paced at speeds appropriate for almost every scenario. There are a few obvious goofs but they hardly detract from the heavy engrossment the storyline causes the willing viewer.Of the six (more to come) that have been released , I rate Empire as the franchises top entry , almost flawless as film , almost. The Empire Strikes back was also the first film I ever saw.Worth watching. Over and Over.Four Stars(of 5.)"
22819,True,"i wanted to briefly state that this is how films and sequels should me made, i know i am not stating new ground here but the sophistication of this film makes me wonder why the template hasn't been used more. it doesn't pick up where we left off, we aren't treated as morons with constant plot explaining, it ends with hope lost. can we have more of this, i don't like happy endings, never seems real in a movie. Han solo being froze is my favourite thing. the twist is a classic move, lando comes in and is instantly a great character, the universe becomes more expanded. the effects look better, i don't know why this isn't higher than 12th at the time of writing, i just wanted to state i love this film"
22820,True,"Why is The Empire Strikes Back (1980) such a beloved movie? Star Wars (1977) is more fun, but Empire marks the point where the story gained more emotional depth and the matinée serial black-and-white morality of the original becomes less defined.Howard Hawks once said a great movie has a few great scenes and no bad ones. If that is the case, then Empire is without doubt a great film, as one cannot find a bad scene in the bunch. As for great scenes, just take your pick: the battle on Hoth, Luke's training in Dagobah, the X-wing rising from the swampy muck, Lando's reluctant betrayal, Han and Leia's poignant farewell in the carbon chamber.Undoubtedly, the most iconic moment in this film is the climactic confrontation between Luke and Darth Vader, when our hero discovers his much-idealized father is a fallen Jedi who has lost much of his conscience and humanity. Though Luke's reaction to this reveal is often mocked and even I cannot help but chuckle sometimes, I think it's entirely appropriate. Hamill's big ""noooo"" is not forced or phony; the way his face contorts and his voice cracks makes it feel raw and heartbreaking.This is one of few films that gets better every time you watch it. It also makes me keenly aware how the series declined in quality afterward (Return of the Jedi is okay, but it feels a bit too derivative of the first and a bit too juvenile for an epic conclusion). Out of all the SW films, this one is the closest to perfection."
22821,True,"Since its release The Empire Strikes Back has gained a lot of popularity, and it is now widely considered to be the best of the series. Initially many people were disappointed with its cliffhanger ending. I know I wouldn't want to wait three years for the answer to the ""big question"" that was surely on everyone's minds! Anyway, I think Empire has become widely respected for its maturity in comparison to the other Star Wars movies. It's much more dramatic than A New Hope, and it doesn't have the cutesy aspects of Return of the Jedi. Until Revenge of the Sith, Empire was the darkest Star Wars movie. Empire clearly beats it in the execution department though. All of the characters are put into the worst situations imaginable and have to fight their way out.I think Empire's greatest strength is the character development of Luke, Han, and Leia. Luke faces his greatest fear (confronting Vader) and a romance blooms between Han and Leia. While the script and the performances are not Oscar worthy I do think this Star Wars movie has the best performances in the series. I believe this is largely due to Irvin Kirshner taking over the director's helm for Lucas. Lucas is notorious for not being very good with actors; his trademark instructions are ""do it faster and more intense."" Kirshner and Producer Gary Kurtz made sure a lot of care went into the character moments. Personally I don't think Lucas would have done that. Another aspect I like is the fact that the character development is very well balanced, so it doesn't feel like any of the principle characters are just tag-alongs, like in ROTJ. Darth Vader becomes the ultimate bad ass here in his hunt for Luke. My favorite Vader line: ""The Force is with you young Skywalker... but you are not a Jedi yet."" The lightsaber duel is my favorite of the series as well. There was something evil about the Carbon Freezing Chamber, perhaps it was that red glow.Empire brought us to some of the best locations in the series, such as the swamp planet Dagobah, the ice planet Hoth, and Cloud City. This happens to be the only Star Wars movie that doesn't have Tattooine. The snow speeder battle contains some excellent stop motion animation which holds up very well today. It certainly was unusual to put the major dogfight scene in the beginning of the movie rather than at the end, but I don't think many people complained.We are also introduced to new characters like Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch), and Yoda. Frank Oz's performance is nothing short of amazing. He deserves a great deal of credit for turning a rubber puppet into a living, breathing person. Like Lucas said, if that puppet hadn't worked the whole movie would have been lost. One valid criticism of Empire is that the action really just stops once Luke lands on Dagobah. I can't say I was ever bored by Empire's middle act. I found Luke's Jedi training and Han and Leia's moments to be thoroughly entertaining. However, I can perfectly understand why a casual moviegoer would be bored by this act. Either way, EBS is still a must see for any film buff."
22822,True,"The rebels have had their brief victory over the Imperial Forces; destroying the Death Star. But the rebels are on the run, hiding on the remote planet Hoth. Though hidden for now, it doesn't last long. The Empire have found the rebels base and are going to wipe them out. When the rebels escape, Luke goes to find Yoda, to begin his training to become a Jedi. Han, Chewbacca, Leia and C3PO are having more trouble. They are being run down by the Imperial Force fleet; trouble is the Millennium Falcon is falling apart, making their escape all the harder. Finally escaping they head to the cloud city to take refuge with Han's old friend, Lando. But Lando is stuck in a bind. He is being used as a pawn by Darth Vader, to set a trap for Luke.This can easily be said to be one of only a few sequels that has surpassed the original. The Empire Strikes Back is darker, deeper plotting, much better dialog and incorporates more action without relying upon it. T.E.S.B. expand the story even further, creating some startling revelations. I still remember the first time i heard Vader's mind boggling truth to Luke. This also perfectly sets up for the third sequel, ending on such a note of anticipation.The acting is also better. Here all the actor have fitted comfortably into their characters. As the dialog is better, they seem a lot more comfortable; Lucas's writing in the first Star Wars at times seemed really basic and childish, but its more intellectual here.The special effects are just great. They make the action sequences so much better. The fight between the rebels and the Imperial Walkers is so amazing. The fight between Luke and Vader is so intense and emotionally charged; it stays with you that fight.A step forward in the Star Wars movies. One of the best sequels to any movie."
22823,True,"This film changed my life....i fell in love with Star Wars when it was re-released on video in the early 90's.I was a small boy that would obsess over things like Batman & Nickelodien.After i saw the trilogy, i went and bought everything i could get my hands on.Children of nerds should be given this at birth.This film is,in my opinion,is the greatest of all the Star Wars films.I think that it has a fantastic ending,cool characters (Boba Fett,Yoda,Lando) and great acting.I recommend this film for every Sci-Fi fan (even the Trekkies).I also must say that this is just a great film all around(not just for a space-fantasy)."
22824,True,"I think when this came out in 1980, no one saw the twist at the end coming. If you don't know the twist because you have been blocked from or chose to block the Star Wars saga, you are missing out. I don't know a lot of people who don't know how it ends.I will tell the story as best as I can since I don't have it at home (it's sad, I know): We begin at a very cold planet where Luke goes out and is missing. Many people want to give up searching for him. Meanwhile, Luke gets kidnapped by the 1980's version of an alien Abominable Snowman. After escaping the monster and killing it (I think), Luke goes out into the blizzard and sees Obi-Wan's spirit in the distance, telling him to go to Yoda on the planet Dagobah, and continue training. Han Solo finds him, about to freeze to death, and rescues him. Back at the base, they treat him and he makes a full recovery. Later on in the movie, the evil guys come to the planet and attack using those AT-AT walkers. The big battle begins and of course, the good guys win. What did you expect? On Dagobah, a little green man meets with Luke and R2D2. He is revealed to be Yoda. What I find cool is that Frank Oz has done the voice of Yoda for all of the Star Wars movies. You can tell that it's him in the Return of the Jedi because when he says ""When 900 years old you reach, looking good you will not be"" he sounds like Fozzie from the Muppets. Luke starts his training.Skipping a bit, the gang meets Lando Calrissian, the former owner of the Millennium Falcon. They all try to evade the Empire, but they realized that they've been tricked by Lando, who says that he had to join the bad guys to keep them from invading the city they're in. Luke is lured by his friends to the Empire and Darth Vader.Getting close to the intense part of the movie, they take Luke, Leia, and Han to a new place. Han gets frozen in carbonite. You'll see him like this in the next movie. When everyone leaves except for Luke and Darth Vader, the battle of all battles commences.As their fight ensues, they reach an area where if you fall, that is almost certainly your doom. Darth traps Luke and chops his lightsaber along with his right arm and they both fall down. Luke tells Darth that he killed his father.And then, the big twist............ are you ready? Here it is. After Luke says that here is what Darth says:""No, Luke. I am your father."" In my opinion, best twist they made back then. Naturally, Luke denies this. Darth offers Luke to join the Dark Side, but instead, like any crazy fool, he jumps. He calls to Leia, using the Force (foreshadowing? Maybe...) and he gets rescued. They look for Han, and the movie ends.How was that? Make your pick on which of the original ones was the best. I don't care, really. George Lucas is awesome. The movies are awesome. Watch and you won't be disappointed."
22825,True,"This film, the second of George Lucas' incredible Saga, not only expands on the first and improves upon it in many ways but it also proves that a film can be a huge success without having a true beginning or end. Rather The Empire Strikes Back is but another chapter in the enduring tale begun by a New Hope.But it has enough witty dialog, amazing action sequences and brilliant new characters to make it a wonderful film in its own right as well.We pick up the story on the remote island of Hoth where the Rebel Alliance has established a base beneath the snow. The Galatic Empire is hot on their tale as Darth Vadar continues his obsessive search for young Luke Skywalker, in whom he has sensed a strength beyond any he himself possesses. Luke meanwhile sets out on his own voyage to the swamps of Dagobah in search of the famed Jedi Master Yoda to train as a Jedi.In order to help the story along Lucas introduces a range of new and interesting characters. A new villain emerges in the form of the cold hearted calculating Bounty Hunter Boba Fett hired by Vadar to find Skywalker. Fett has his own agenda too. He is being payed by Jabba the Hutt to capture Han Solo from whom Jabba is owed a dept. Another ally is also to be found in Lando Clarissian , smooth talking Administrator of Cloud City mining colony. A gambler, smuggler and old friend of Han he has entered into a tenuous deal with Vadar to protect his city but in the process must betray his old friend to the Empire.Perhaps the most iconic and best loved of all the characters is not a human at all but a small green puppet who likes talking backwards. Jedi Master Yoda is by far the most entertaining non-human character and is a perfect mix humor, mystery and wisdomThis film is much darker and action packed then the first with battles on Hoth and the desperate feeling from the Imperial Fleet of the Millennium Falcon. There is drama coming at you from all angles as Han Solo taken prisoner by Boba Fett in the most cruel manner and Vadar conspires to turn Luke to the Dark Side.We see a crueler, more selfish and sadistic side to Vader than before which adds to the tension.Here also the ultimate man-to-man combat as Luke Skywalker comes face to face with Darth Vadar and learns in the process a terrible truth about his Father leading to perhaps the most famous quote in Cinematic history.There is also a little romance thrown into the mix as Han and Leia's relationship develops.The Empire Strikes Back has some of the wittiest lines in the entire Saga. Such memorable quotes as "" Laugh it up fuzzball!"" and "" He is clumsy as he is stupid"" when heard in context show the skill of Lucas as scriptwriter. Special Effects beggar belief has giant four-legged walking robots are felled by fighter planes and Imperial Destroyers chase the Millennium Falcon across the Galaxy. Clearly this film is George and Co at full artistic strength.For a film with no beginning and and no end The Empire Strikes Back is a masterpiece.It continues the Saga in a believable and captivating way and succeeds in leaving the audience gagging for more as we hope and pray Han will survive, will Luke not to give up on his path and be turned to the Dark Side and wonder how the rebels will recover from the blows dealt them by the Empire ."
22826,True,"Generally regarded as the best of the 5 Star Wars movies(so far, the sixth and final one comes out in May 2005), The Empire Strikes Back is everything Star Wars wasn't. Back in 1977, George Lucas brought us the first story from a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away, Star Wars (Now known as ""A New Hope""), and it was a bright, cheerful Saturday afternoon serial with some great special effects. Three years later, George Lucas' story about Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo took a decidedly darker tone in The Empire Strikes Back. None of the good guys win in this second chapter of the 3 film saga that makes up the Original Star Wars Trilogy, the film acts as a dark bridge from the light, fun action of A New Hope to the concluding Return of the Jedi. Even the last scene of this film reeks of ""To Be Continued,"" without actually saying it. The rebel forces, after blowing up the Death Star, are forced to hide out on a the ice planet Hoth. Darth Vader tracks them down, and our heroes are forced to flee. Han and Leia go one way, Luke has to find the Jedi Master Yoda on his secluded swamp planet (voice of Frank Oz). Yoda may be the most lifelike character in ""Empire,"" and that's a pretty good compliment to a Muppet. We see Luke fail to master his Jedi powers, and we see him leave in haste to try to save Han and Leia who walk into a trap while visiting Han's old card playing friend, Lando Carisian (Billy Dee Williams). How Luke tries to save his friends is unimportant, as the single most shocking movie revelation comes during the final duel of the movie between Luke and Darth Vader. Unsuspecting movie goers have been blindsided by this scene for decades now. The tone, set by director Irvin Kershner, is darker and more serious, lends an adult feel to what is basically a kid's movie. The special effects are again top-notch, especially in the beautiful Cloud City and the fantastic looking asteroid field chase. Who knew in 1980 George Lucas had reached the pinnacle of his Star Wars franchise with a movie starring a green little troll voiced by the same guy who voices Miss Piggy?"
22827,True,"I saw The Empire Strikes Back (TESB) when I was 13 or 14, and I didn't like it back then. I've seen it many times since, and in my later views I really wanted to like it, but I ended up disliking it even more. The first sign of silliness in my eyes was the snow-speeders equipped with harpoons and towing cables. Why should anyone install a harpoon to a flying machine? It turns out to topple AT-ATs. But how did they know they'd fight against walking moto-quadrupeds? Well, they didn't. It dawned on me that that was nothing more than lazy storytelling. Create the outcome first (tackle walking machines), invent how to generate it (using cables) later. And do it again, this time with Luke.Why did Luke flee the cave into the cold snow storm instead of killing the wampa? Because he had to come to the brink of death. And why is that? Because just before passing out he needs to see Obi-Wan's ghost. And what's it doing there? Obi-Wan's spirit is there to tell Luke where to find Yoda. Sorry but this is nonsense. First, the flow of the story is backwards, because at the time Luke leaves the cave, he has no reason to do so; he should have killed the wampa and stayed inside. Second, this part of the story must be about setting our main character in motion. Luke needs a motivation to pursue his Jedi training. One may argue that this must be the natural outcome of the first film. But still, Mr Lucas owes the viewer a decent sequence showing how Luke discovers where Yoda lives. The way Luke is informed of Dagobah in TESB is simply bad storytelling.That also leads to a hollow first act. The action in there has nothing to do with Luke's storyline. The Battle of Hoth is completely pointless. The first act must be all about sending Luke to Dagobah. Luke will go there anyway with or without this useless battle. But instead of watching Luke discover Yoda and Dagobah, we have to watch some silly battle.As a consequence, we have a first act disjointed from the rest of the film. The action is isolated from, and not related to, the further events. You can start watching the film 35 minutes into it, when Luke gives R2 the coordinates of the Dagobah system. There's nothing that makes sense before, explaining why Luke wants to finish his training, or how he knows where to go. For further study, compare this to how the story unfolds in A New Hope.Things don't go well in the second act either. The story forks, and I have the feeling that Mr Lucas didn't know what to do with Han Solo and Leia, and decided to hide them inside the stomach of a giant space eel. Luke in Dagobah scenes don't fare better. Luke is a pilot and is supposed to be top physical form. Why all the physical training? And it contradicts with what Yoda says: luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. Actually the problem is deeper. Jedi training is obviously not well thought of. It may look impressive on paper, with stream of consciousness and the like, but all we see on screen is a guy running with a backpack full of rocks, or trying to levitate things around him.The film is sort of alright 75 minutes into it, after Yoda moves Luke's X-wing out of the swamp. But not enough to make it more than 4 stars out of 10. Don't forget that some of the things the fans pan in Return of the Jedi and in the prequels are present in TESB some way, though not as pronounced as in the prequels. I have to come back to that but the first act of The Empire Strikes Back is a disaster. I've tried to make objective points anyone could check for themselves, you like this film or not. If you think that TESB is flawless, please think twice."
22828,True,"Empire is an entertaining film and a terrific setup for the finale. The battle and setup at Hoth is entertaining. The exchanges between Han and Lea are entertaining. The droids are quite funny in this one, but don't belittle the drama. The development of Darth Vader and the Empire is vicious and well placed. The end a real cliff hanger and a surprise the first time through.So why not 10 stars? My main complaint of the film is the middle act isn't exciting. Just think for a second about all the fun action in the middle of a new hope compared to Empire. In A New Hope they get on the Falcon, Luke trains in the force, a planet is destroyed, they encounter the death star, they hide from the troops, they save the princess, Obi-Wan fights Vader and dies, they fight off a ton of troops to get back to the falcon and they fight some tie fighters in the air to escape the Death Star. In Empire Strikes back Han, Lea and company try to escape the empire before eventually getting caught. Darth Vader and the empire decide to try to convert Luke, and Luke learns from Yoda before eventually leaving against Yoda's will to save his friends.Sorry Empire, but in comparison, that isn't a lot of excitement especially if you have already seen the film before. How could the middle act have been better you might ask? I say increase the pace of everything, especially Yoda and Luke's first meeting. Maybe Han could have had Chewy and/or Lea firing at the tie fighters and bombers from the gunner position while on the run. There also could have been a space fight with cloud city with Lando saving the Falcon crew at the last moment.All I'm saying is that there's a real excitement void in the middle act of the movie which everyone seems to gloss over. And i think this shortcoming is more than enough to make Empire the worst, rather than the best of the original trilogy. It's still a solid film, but I like Return of the Jedi and A New Hope more. and I'm bewildered by the masses who proclaim Empire to be the best Star Wars movie or one of the best movies ever."
22829,True,"When I watched this movie as a kid I loved it. However now that I've gotten older I'm realizing that it's a pretty bad movie. The movie is mainly a bunch of drama and pointless scenarios. I know that back in the 80's violence on t.v. wasn't really the normal thing, but it seriously lacks. LOL Luke Skywalker plays one of the most idiotic heroes i've ever come across. He's such an idiot in this movie that it's pretty annoying and chalkboard scratching. Luke listens to obi-won and goes to the secluded planet to find master Yoda. That seems to be the last time in this movie Luke really listens to anyone. Yoda tries to teach Luke and all he does is complain and moan and not listen to anything Yoda says. Then Luke gets a vision of his friends in pain and he suddenly has to leave, even though both Yoda and Obi-won tell him he risks losing everything. He still defy's the only Jedi master left alive and his own mentor to do what?......not save anyone and get his hand chopped off....idiot. Then he gets rescued. I swear if Luke was my pupil I would have knocked him upside the head a few times. George Lucas could have come up with something better than that tragedy. Overall its an o.k. film filled with an idiot hero Jedi. The only clever person of the bunch seems to be Han solo. Watch it, its a classic.....but soon to be a dead one that nobody will care to watch anymore because its dull, boring, and idiotic. George Lucas is all hype now from people who love light sabers and the force. His old films are nothing but duds now."
22830,True,"What can I say about The Empire Strikes Back that hasn't already been said? That's a genuine question. Star Wars V is one of the best movies to ever be made in cinema history, and I'm not just saying that as a Star Wars fan. It has action sequences you feel when you see it for the first time or if you haven't seen it in a long time. And it has one of the most quoted movie lines ever, ""No, I am your father."" Another good thing is that out of the original trilogy episode V has the least special edition changes so you can experience the original movie with just a few changes. Overall if you haven't seen this movie in a while then you should blow the dust off your VHS player and watch some good old Star Wars."
22831,True,"The best film out of the saga. A great twists and turns and an epic cliff hanger ending! Wont go into detail but the fight scene between Luke and Darth Vader was the biggest shock a young 7 year old me had in my experience in going to the cinema! The character development too is great! It shows how mature the young characters have become since their last run-in with the Empire in Episode IV. Some say the special effects are dated, to me they are way better than the prequel trilogy! Whilst the prequel trilogy looks like a cartoon, the special effects and model shorts in Episodes IV, V & VI look and feels more realistic and convincing on the eyes. 10/10 Death Stars for this one!"
22832,True,"After the success of Star Wars I think I might have expected a slip if they took it to a sequel but apparently George Lucas' love for this world trumped film making curses for bad sequels. The Empire Strikes Back brings back the incredible original heroes, gives them even more depth and story and still finds time to bring in new timeless characters that become legends in their own right. Even with a new director at the helm, Irvin Kershner, the story and the world that made the first Star Wars so incredible is in tact and even better. The only problem really with the first Star Wars is it felt like only the beginning. Like there were layers of detail that we didn't get and The Empire Strikes Back burst into those layers and put us deep into the world and the story never to turn back. On top of that the film delivers the first and most infamous twist in film history...family connections so to speak. I won't give it away if you have existed under a rock for the last three decades. The fights are epic, the new characters are amazing, and even Hamill as Skywalker starts to really shine and get some real depth to his character.I already reviewed the cast of the original film but their characters really do change a lot for the better in the sequel. Mark Hamill's performance matures and really comes full circle just like his character in the film. His naivety and boyish charm changes for the better as he trains to become a Jedi and an adult. Harrison Ford's Han Solo is probably the character that changes the least and probably just a case of ""don't mess with a good thing."" Solo is still a kick butt hero and his story is a focal point of the sequel. Carrie Fisher slips back into her role as the feisty Princess flawlessly. This time the banter and romantic tension between Fisher and Ford heats up and really gives the story a timeless romance. Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and Peter Mayhew return in full form as C3P0, R2D2 and Chewbacca and they are better than ever. David Prowse with James Earl Jones providing the voice continues to make Darth Vader the most evil, intensely bad villain in the history of films. Vader's character really turns up the heat and gives a terrifying turn as the leader of the Empire. Billy Dee Williams is a newcomer to the cast and a welcome addition. He plays gambler, scoundrel Lando Calrissian. He doesn't get a lot of background or depth to his character and yet he is a great addition to the cast. And saving the best for last...the master of the Star Wars Universe. Frank Oz brings Master Yoda to life. The entire sequence with Luke and Yoda meeting for the first time and training is brilliant. Yoda is a timeless character, a pop culture phenomenon and yet his part in this is touching, funny, and brilliant. Pretty good for a puppet.The Empire Strikes Back is just simply non stop. The film picks up where the first left off and takes the viewer on a thrill ride that just never stops. This is ultimately all about the evil Empire and Vader getting his revenge and essentially succeeding. Starting from the opening moment of the film on the brilliantly crafted ice world of Hoth, and continuing on to a show down between Skywalker and Vader himself and the revealing of the infamous secret this film is just brilliant. The direction, the creation, the writing, the characters and the special effects are jaw droppingly amazing. There is simply no way you can watch just one Star Wars movie because the story is so important but after watching the first one and thinking...wow this is pretty incredible, The Empire Strikes Back will floor you!! One of the greatest sequels of all time. 10/10"
22833,True,It's a great movie but episode four was the best. This one continues on where episode four left off. Now Luke begins his training as a Jedi Knight with master Yoda. Yoda messes with him in the beginning by not being Yoda but Luke figures it out. I love Yoda and think that he is a great character. I don't know what Star Wars would be without him.Then Luke has to rescue his kidnapped friends from Darth Vadar. The movie is awesome and it still stands up as a great movie even to this day. Near the end there is a great twist that really throws the audience off the plank. If you haven't see this movie please see it but see episode four first and then this one. Strike back and see this movie. The force wants you to!
22834,True,"Empire Strikes Back took everything that was revolutionary from Star Wars and improved it, and then some. It is deeper, more mature, and asks more questions of the world. R2D2 and Chewbacca, who became lovable fan favourites from the moment they hit the screen in 1977, did so without speaking a single word, but here they are much more than just accessories to the plot. In their grunts and roars and beeps, they now became beacons of loyalty for our group. The iconic opening crawl speaks of the events in between the two films - a time skip has occurred and the rebels are in hiding. The strengths of the characterisations show us exactly what has happened in these months unseen; Luke has become a respected fighter and commander, Han a captain, and his bickering and romantic tension with Leia only growing stronger (and which results in one of the most iconic confessions of love of all time). We see the bonds of friendship so much stronger in this sequel, and as Chewie attempts to repair CP3O and carries him around like a backpack, we recognise this is as an emotion of universality. No wonder Lucas used it again with Luke and Yoda. Fox had placed little faith in the original, and the budget had been constricted, and Lucas's vision mellowed. But after the immense popularity and success, ESB was given full backing. The world of Star Wars was now even more fully realised. We had visited the deserts of Tattoine, the Aztec pyramids rebel bases amidst jungle territory, and now the icy planets of Hoth, where an imperial assault is imminent. The battlefield was now much clearer and the greenscreen backdrops of the dogfight-style fighter pilots more detailed, more immersive - fellow rebel ground fighters, jets and Imperial assault crews now milled around in the background, and live explosions proved to be more threatening than the multicoloured digital explosions in the black of space. There was real weight and fluidity in the way that the X-Wings would speed in and out and under and over the AT-ATs, and the coverage now provided a greater and more epic scale of the action; see Luke run around the legs and dangle from the elephant- like robotic beast, and how the Millennium Falcon weaves around an entirely three dimensional asteroid field and narrowly escapes from a gigantic space slug. We have more new developments. Besides the stop-motion photography of the AT-ATs, which creates an oddly appropriate jerky walking motion, we also have the puppetry of the endearing Tauntauns which amble about in the snow, and their models are amazingly detailed, head to claw in a thick frost-covered hair, a dragon-shaped head and curved horns. And there is the old Jedi Master Yoda, whom I am conflicted on; at times it remains painfully obvious that he is a puppet, whose mouth does not correspond to the truths that he speaks, but they are great and important truths that become even more evident once Luke encounters the foreshadowing of himself in a Vader helmet. And of course the matte paintings are once again immaculate and beautifully detailed; in particular the landing platform on the edge of the Cloud City, and the glorious Bespin itself, bathed in the pink glow of the sunset and clouds. As the Falcon soars away above the sunset, Williams' Cloud City orchestral theme is at its most stirring, and is the second most iconic in the soundtrack, right after (what else?) The Imperial March. Never has a trumpet fanfare been so menacing and so recognisable - also named Darth Vader's Theme because the mere sighting of it signalled his presence and power. Vader is photographed more ingeniously than in Star Wars (in brightly lit exteriors) and this enhances his terrifying persona; giving instructions from his own personal capsule, force-choking over the communications channel, emerging from icy mist in the freezing tunnels of Hoth, slivers of light hitting his mask and creating a dark and shiny gleam, and in that climatic duel between father and son, both are silhouetted on the orange steps by the smoking vents, and the colours of the shimmering lightsabers tell us all that we need to know about their allegiances. This is one of the classic movie villains at his peak, but it is more than black and white (or blue and red) morality - there is just a hint of fatherly affection behind that mask, buried deep below, but we see the inklings of a plan, tinges of regret that have formed over the years living in the Dark Side. And in Luke's horrified reaction, the realisation that his own vices may well lead him down the same path. The studio was not entirely happy about leaving Vader in his tumbling TIE fighter after the explosion of the first Death Star; sequels were regarded as pulpy cash-ins rather than significant narratives. But Empire proves its worth, and then some - it ends with Vader's cruel blow and confession, the loss of a hand, and the capture of a beloved character...but there is still a glimmer of hope. It remains one of the remarkable sci-fi achievements."
22835,True,"For Me this is one of the most important movies in history. This movie had to live up to the movie that changed how movies were made and filmed and exceeded it in every way.The Empire strikes back is the second movie in the Original Star Wars trilogy directed by George Lucas. Straight away this movie had a darker feel than the first one as we are introduced to a new planet known as Hoth. The opening sequence is brilliant with Luke being captured by the the ice creature, and is shortly followed by the riveting battle of Hoth.The Plot of the Movie is that of the title. The empire wants to get revenge on the rebels for destroying the death star in the previous movie. Although there is a deeper meaning to the plot. Darth Vader is after Luke Skywalker as he realises that he is the last threat to the empire. Instead of trying to kill him he want's him by his side for him to rule along side him.In this movie we are introduced to Yoda who is an old Jedi Master who Luke has summoned in the hope that he would train him to become a Jedi Knight. He showed that Jedi come in all shapes and sizes and proved that to Luke when he lifted an all but seamless sunken X wing from the deep waters of Dagobah. Yoda was maybe the best new character in this movie as he came across as funny but at the same time very wise and was one with the force. Han and Princess Leia travel to the cloud city where they are greeted by one of Han's former allies Lando. Although shortly after they arrive They find out that they has struck a deal with Darth Vader who holds them hostage, using them as bait knowing Luke would come to them.For them what followed shower what a great story teller George Lucas was at the time and how much he cared about the characters and how they had develop from the last movie.Han Solo is frozen in carbonite and sold to a bounty hunter Bobba Fett, who would take him to Jabba the Hutt. While this scene is taking place Harrison Ford says one of the best improvised lines in movie history. Princess Leia tells him that she loves him and he replies"" I know"". Apparently Harrison Ford thought that line would be better than what was originally planned. When Luke finally get's to Vader an epic light saber duel takes place. Vader is toying with Luke and trying to get him to use his anger and slowly turn to the dark side of the force as he knows it's the only way he can defeat him. Eventually Vader overpowers Luke and chops off his arm leaving Luke defenseless. Once again the movie proves why it's one of the greatest of all time when Vader tells Luke that he is his father, taking everybody by shock. Luke cannot believe it and tries to commit suicide by letting himself fall down a huge drop as he believes he has nothing to live for. Leia and Chewbacca pick up Luke and fly off into light speed escaping the empire. The film ends with a glimmer of hope as Luke and Leila are looking into a bright star which identifies there is still hope for them yet.Overall this film is a masterpiece. It provides everything a great sequel needs. A great plot, great characters, a menacing villain and humour when needed. All of this was done correctly by George Lucas who didn't just create one the most iconic film trilogies of all time he created a whole universe of different stories and characters thanks to these three great movies. In my opinion though this one is the best of the lot."
22836,True,I gotta admit I never always like Star Wars episode 5 the empire Strikes back. I use to think that it was boring and had too much talking and Information but I grew older and now I study films and notice Why certain things happen and how they make a film better. I will not deny that I am tired of hearing certain scenes but that doesn't happen Often. Honestly if you haven't seen this you must. The only problem I can think Off is the battle between vader and Luke. I want to know why vader didn't kill Luke and what happened to R2. Why did he get dragged down at dagobha What was the point of that scene. The film has a great beginning and a good Ending. Overall as a trilogy it is better than the prequels
22837,True,"This is the sequel to the original Star Wars (1977) and is the best film in the entire saga. It brings back all of the things people loved about the original and added more action and more great characters. This film and the original or considered some of the best movies of all time, and while this film did not receive as much critical acclaim as the first, most fans of the Star Wars saga will agree that this one is the best. The film begins in the rebel base on the ice planet Hoth. The whole Hoth sequence is my favorite of the whole series. We see our hero Luke Skywalker get attacked by a yeti like monster and have to use the force to escape. The battle with the Empire's At-Ats and the rebels is the coolest scene in the movie. The AT-ATs are giant walking machines that are almost impenetrable so Luke and the other rebel pilots have to come up with a way to stop them because their guns won't stop them. Luke devises a plan where they circle the legs with a towing line to trip them. It is a really really cool scene. The Empire does shut down the bases power though our heroes must flee.Instead of joining Han, Chewy, and Leia, Luke goes to the Dagobah system because of a vision he received from the ghost of his former master Obi-Wan Kenobi. On Dagobah Luke meets Yoda. Yoda is one of the most iconic Star Wars characters. He is the most powerful Jedi warrior even though he is only about a foot tall and green. Yoda trains Luke to become the ultimate Jedi Warrior.Meanwhile Han and the Millennium Falcon are being chased by the Empire through asteroid fields. They decide to go to Cloud City to enlist the help of Han's old friend Lando, Billy Dee Williams. It ends up being a trap and Darth Vader captures Han, Chewy, and Leia. Sensing that his friends are in trouble Luke abandons his training to go rescue them. The result is one of the most iconic endings to any film. Including perhaps the biggest twist in Cinema History up to this point. I won't say it here and spoil it, but it is so iconic you probably know about it even if you haven't seen the film. This film is Star Wars at its best! I love all the movies, but this is the one where they really did it right. It has tons of awesome action, and really expands the Star Wars Universe. This is the kind of movie that I could watch at any time and would just as in to it!10/10"
22838,True,"Star Wars: Episode 5- The Empire Strikes Back (1980): Dir: Irwin Kershner / Cast: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Billy Dee Williams, David Prowse: Blindsiding visual wonder recalling the threat to Rebel forces whom are hiding on the ice planet Hoth. Luke Skywalker is instructed to seek Jedi training from Yoda. An attack by Imperial forces leaves the Rebel base in ruins but Han Solo, Princess Leia and company narrowly escape in the Millennium Falcon. They venture to Cloud City where Lando Calrissian betrays them thus setting a trap for Skywalker. Cliffhanger ending hinders it in standing on its own but director Irwin Kershner explores darker aspects. Mark Hamill returns as Luke who learns endurance, concentration, priorities, friendship, and very hard truths that leave him literally dangling for survival. Harrison Ford as Han learns to put the needs of others ahead of his own particularly when sacrifices arise. Carrie Fisher return as Leia who strengthens her leadership. Billy Dee Williams as Lando realizes his mistakes and hopes correction is possible. David Prowse dons the suit and presents the intimidating presence of Darth Vader who presents those ever famous hard hitting words to Luke. Special effects are just as electrifying with the appearance of Yoda among other creatures and landscapes. The film serves as a follow up to Star Wars with intriguing suspense and imagination. Score: 7 / 10"
22839,True,"STAR WARS:Empire strikes back,The second installment in original trilogy and i must say it is best in the series and perhaps greatest sci-fi flicks ever made . Irvin Kershner and George Lucas comes together to make this iconic film which is shot beautifully,even though it was made nearly 35 years ago the visuals still hold up and will for ages to come.More than visuals it is the depth of the story that makes this a masterpiece.The movie starts off from the end of episode 4,where rebels are pursed by the empire after destruction of death star.Rebels are forced to establish a secret base on ice planet hoth.After the imperial AT-AT walkers attack their secret base,princess Leia,Han solo ,chewbacca and C-3PO escape in millennium falcon while Luke and R2-D2 go to the dagobah system to receive training from master Yoda and become a Jedi.Luke must decide whether to complete his training or go save his friend who are now captured by evil Darth Vader.The final fight between Vader and Luke will surely blow your mind .And finally breathtaking music by john Williams.Empire strikes back is best trilogy even though New hope and return of the Jedi are perfect.Forget the disastrous prequels and go watch the original trilogy when Lucas was at his best."
22840,True,"When this movie came out in 1980, people were unsure of how it can live up to the hype due to the success of the previous film. But it did deliver! This movie went to even darker places this time around, and the characters are left at the lowest point by the end of the film. Great action sequences, great acting and above all the biggest twist of all time! Story: The Rebels have built a new base of operations called Echo Base on the ice planet Hoth after the Empire chased them off Yavin IV in response to the Death Star being destroyed. It's not long before the Empire discovers their new hideout and force the Rebels once again to flee from the invasion of Imperial AT-AT walkers. Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca and C-3PO escape in the Millennium Falcon, but are later captured by Darth Vader on Cloud City with Han Solo being frozen in carbonite and handed over to Boba Fett who takes him back to Jabba the Hutt. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker travels to the swamp planet Dagobah to continue his Jedi training but this time from former Jedi Master Yoda. During his training, he sees visions of Leia, Han and Chewbacca being kidnapped by Vader and sets out to Cloud Cit to rescue them, only get into a confrontation with Darth Vader where he discovers the most shocking secret about Vader.Everything in this film is close to perfect as you can get: The battle of Hoth is one of my favorite movie battle scenes ever, and the music once again makes it awesome. The asteroid field pursuit is entertaining as hell, and the light saber fight between Luke and Darth Vader... it's basically indescribable. The acting once again is fantastic with Mark Hamill once again giving another solid performance as a young impatient Luke Skywalker who fails every task given to him by Yoda, Harrison Ford once again owning the role of Han Solo and his interactions with Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) make for some really entertaining dialogue. I also like seeing how their relationship actually grows from love/hate to a love relationship, especially since Han grows throughout the trilogy. Billy Dee Williams as Lando brings his own brand of charm to brighten the mood up until he is forced to betray Han, but redeems himself by turning against the Empire and helping Leia attempt to save Han. As for Yoda, he is so awesome in this one! Frank Oz's puppetry is so terrific that it's better than anything CGI can do today (not that I despise CGI). I love the scenes where he's training Luke on Dagobah, especially the part where he goes ""Not this crude matter!"" Darth Vader is more evil than he was in the first one. He's killing lieutenants left and right that it makes me go, ""I'll do whatever you want, just please don't choke me!"" As for the big twist where he says ""I am your father"" to Luke, it still gets me every time. I can't remember the first time I heard him say that line because I was like 5 or 6 years old when I first watched ""Empire"" but when he says it and you hear that music playing in the background and the look on Luke's face... you still feel that shock that Luke feels.It goes without saying that this is not only the best Star Wars movie ever, this is one of the best MOVIES ever made. As for sequels surpassing the predecessor, for me it's right up there with ""The Godfather Part 2"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Spider-Man 2"" and ""T2 - Judgement Day"". Even with the foul taste that a lot of people have in their mouths from the prequel trilogy, they need to watch this again to be reminded that George Lucas gave us a great saga. Final grade: A+"
22841,True,"Most of the time, sequels are a bit of a disappointment, because of lame story and poor special effects. The Empire Strikes Back on the other hand is one of the best sequels I've ever seen in my life. Everything in this film is marvelous. The story is great, and the character development is far more dark and gruesome than in the first film. The new characters, such as Yoda and Lando Calrissian really add something to the Star Wars saga.And what would an Empire Strikes Back review be without mentioning one of the most famous lines of all time: No, I am your father.Truly a shocker, perhaps one of the greatest move climaxes of all time. In conclusion, The Empire Strikes Back (Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back) is outstanding, and meets all the standards that movie sequels should. I never get tired of watching it."
22842,True,"For me, The Empire Strikes Back is one of the best films I have seen. It is the best of the five Star Wars films, though perhaps that is down to director Irvin Kershner who tweaked George Lucas's original vision into something darker than the original and infinitely bleaker than the follow-up Return of the Jedi. Lucas reportedly hated 'Empire' upon seeing what Kershner had done to his film and put together another cut that he later conceded was inferior, and Kershner's vision made it to screens around the world.***SPOILERS***The Empire Strikes Back serves as an interesting bridge between A New Hope and 'Jedi', introducing Force masters Yoda and the Emperor (the latter not yet played by the magnificent Ian McDiarmid who took on the role in Return of the Jedi three years later), while at the same time taking the original gang of characters and splitting them up in different directions, a scenario copied to the point of tedium by the Expanded Universe books.Based upon the 'classic trilogy', Darth Vader is one of cinema's greatest villains and perhaps it will take until the release of the sixth film in 2005 to be sure what effect the prequels will have had on that image. In 'A New Hope' we are introduced to a near-merciless killer  and his evil nature seems to have grown by the time of 'Empire'. One by one, incompetent underlings make their way to the Super Star Destroyer morgue as the Sith Lord searches for his prize. It isn't until 'Jedi' that we feel Vader to be human at all, despite the famous cliffhanger end to this film.
It's hard to define what this film means to me, other than alot. Hopefully the DVD is not be lightyears away. 10/10"
22843,True,"Before I get to in depth with this whole review, I will get one thing out of the way. This isn't just possibly the best Star Wars movie. This is just flat out the best Star Wars movie in terms of film making. However, I will say this though. It is my least favorite of the original trilogy in terms of watch value. I can recognize that it is the best, but sill not really think that it is the greatest to watch.I will get the stuff that makes it so great out of the way first. First off, it is very well acted at least for Star Wars standards. It had a lot of talent and effort put into it and it shows with the fact that everybody seemed to be at their top here. It also has one of the best endings in the series as well as nice and long training bit with Yoda at Dagobah and it shows that Luke can be able to at least fight sort of in terms of how he can handle the light saber. And the battle of Hoth was a great way to open the movie and gets you into what is going on with just the first thirty minutes or so.Although one of the reasons on why it is not my favorite one to watch is just that it can be really boring at a lot of times. I will not be sad to admit it since it is true. Such as when Han and Leia are in space with Chewy, it can be a bit of a drag and while it does advance the whole plot line of them falling on love forward, it doesn't mean that it is something that I would be fully invested in. However, the ""I love you"" and the ""I know"" line makes up for it.While I could go on to say something bad about this movie, I don't really feel like I can get myself to do so. And while I could say more positive things about this movie, I don't really know if I actually need to since everybody probably already knows of all the good things that are within this movie. I will say that when you watch Star Wars, you should pay attention to this one since it is one that very much will showcase what good Star Wars is like. Many people love this movie, and it really does make sense why they do. It is a genuinely well made movie, and one that has a story that really gets the series from Point A to Point B."
22844,True,"Best movie of the series, including the latest effort.I love everything about this movie, the music is amazing and I love the settings.The characters are really well developed in this movie. Original and mature film making. It fleshes out the characters and makes you care for them even more.I first saw this movie when I was 9 years old and I thought it was magical then and I still do. I have watched both the remastered edition and the original version and they are both beautiful but I think Bespin looks even better in the remastered copy."
22845,True,"Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, this movie paints itself across your screen. Opening with the famous Hoth battle you gasp in awe as the famous Imperial AT-AT's march to crush the rebellion, and watch as your favorite heroes try desperately to stay 2 steps ahead of the empire. Be introduced for the first time to Yoda, and journey to Bespin where you see Boba Fett, an incredible bounty Hunter. Just when you thought it couldn't get any better Darth Vader faces off with his son, and let me just say it is cinema gold. Jump up and down in your seat and gasp as you hear Vader say, ""No. I am your father."" Mutter the words, ""Never tell me the odds,"" and ""Do... or do not. There is no try,"" as you sadly drag yourself away from the movie as you remembering Han Solos fate and the Lose of Lukes hand. I give this a 10/10. ""Why, you stuck up, half-witted, scruffy-looking Nerf herder."""
22846,True,"I grew up on Star Wars, because my oldest brother made me watch it (and I was never mad at him for that) Episode V starts out so strong it makes you wonder how is the film going to become better and the answer is: everything the film progressively gets better throughout the duration and it has an incredibly amazing beginning and it truly in a spectacle on how the film gets better through out. The entire Star Wars trilogy is amazing as itself and with ionic lines such as ""NO, I am your father"" and Han Solo preparing to be frozen in carbonite, kisses Leia with the lines of dialogue ""I love you"" ""I know"" it truly is an icon in American cinema and I thoroughly recommend that if you have not seen the original trilogy, that you go out and buy it and binge watch them all in one day. in my opinion i believe Episode V is the strongest of the 3 and easily the one that shows the most character development through out. Thank you for reading and I hope i helped you"
22847,True,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" clearly has the feel of the middle episode of a trilogy. The beginning carries on from the original ""Star Wars"" film; although the Death Star has been destroyed, the Empire remains strong and the evil Darth Vader continues to hunt down the rebels on their base on the icy planet of Hoth. There is no really definite ending; the film might just as well have ended with the words, familiar from old Saturday morning serials, ""To Be Continued""- which of course it was in ""Return of the Jedi"". In between, the mix is much the same as it was in the first ""Star Wars""- a science-fiction adventure incorporating elements of other film genres, notably the war film but also the western, the oriental martial arts film, sword-and-sorcery type fantasy and the Robin Hood type of mediaeval adventure, all topped off with a helping of mystical religion.All the major characters from the original film make a return in this one; Obi-Wan Kenobi was killed off in a duel with Darth Vader, but returns here as a ghost. The main developments in the story are a growing romance between Han Solo and Leia and a startling revelation about Luke's origins. (I won't say what that is). In addition to Luke, Leia, Han and the rest there are two new characters, Lando Calrissian, an old but not necessarily reliable friend of Han Solo, and Yoda. Yoda is a senior member of the Jedi Knights, the mysterious brotherhood to which Obi-Wan also belonged, and the Jedi Master to whom Luke is sent to undertake training with a view to initiation into the order. The scenes between Luke and Yoda strengthen the semi-religious tone already apparent in the first film; the philosophy of the Jedi, as expounded by Yoda, seems to have much in common with Far Eastern religions such as Zen Buddhism. Given the seriousness with which these scenes were obviously intended to be treated, it struck me as unfortunate that Yoda was not a human being but rather a strange alien creature looking like a wizened garden gnome with outsize ears. It was difficult to take seriously anything said by such a bizarre-looking character, especially as Yoda, despite his supposed immense wisdom, seemed incapable of mastering the rules of English syntax, coming up with odd sentences such as ""This one a long time have I watched"".There is some good acting, particularly from Harrison Ford as Han Solo, a character who undergoes considerable development from the cynic of the first film to a man prepared to take on responsibilities and take risks for what he believes in. It is perhaps a pity that Alec Guinness's role here is rather limited, as he was easily the best actor in the original film. I am not one of those who regard the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy as great cinematic masterpieces, but there is plenty to enjoy in them if you do not take them too seriously and regard them simply as entertaining science-fiction adventures. This is as true of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as it is of its predecessor. 7/10"
22848,True,"This may contain spoilers.It has amazed me for 25 years or so that people consider Empire to be the best of the Star Wars movies. For me, it was perhaps the biggest disappointment of my youth. I will never forget walking out of the theatre in 1980 and remarking to my best friend: ""we waited 3 years for THAT?!?!?""So what's so wrong with Empire? I could go on at length, but essentially it boils down to 3 major problems. (1) Yoda. Yoda is the single most annoying character in the Star Wars trilogy (yes, that does include the awful Jar Jar Binks), and after a weak start on Hoth, the entire movie goes down the toilet when Yoda appears on screen. Yoda looks like a puppet (big surprise -- he IS a puppet), and sounds like every other Frank Oz character; I kept waiting for him to say ""Whacka Whacka"" like Fozzie Bear (I love Fozzie, in case you're wondering). The entire sequence on Yoda's home turf, which is crucial to the movie, just plain doesn't work. It doesn't look otherworldly, it just looks like a poorly lit set. (2) Lando. If we place Jar Jar as the 2nd most annoying character, then Lando is clearly a very close #3. Billy Dee Williams may be a decent actor, but you'd certainly never know it from watching this ham-fisted performance. I have difficulty believing Lando is a living entity, much less a swashbuckling former-pirate. (3) The movie has no ending; it just sort-of stops and leaves you wondering why it wasn't better. I expected, I don't know, some sort of interesting plot resolution, not just a shot of the characters looking out the window. And, yes, I know ""Luke, I am your father"" was supposed to be the climax. Be honest, is there ANYBODY out there who didn't see this one coming at least an hour before it happens? I was only 14 when I saw the movie, and my reaction was ""yeah, no kidding."" Other low points: the wretched ""ice monster"" effect, the hand-puppet asteroid monster, nearly all of the acting (these are the characters we loved in Star Wars?), and especially the directing. High Points: well, the effects are mostly amazing, particularly the asteroid sequence (other than the hand puppet). The music is great too.I have tried for years to like this movie, convinced that I need to get over my disappointment as a teenager. It never works."
22849,True,"""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" is the second film from the ""Star Wars"" franchise and the fifth in terms of chronology of the contents depicted in there. It was directed by Irvin Kershner over 35 years ago and had some success with the Academy Awards, even if not nearly as much as the first film. And I myself must say that I found it not better than the first (even if the IMDb rating says so), but also not much worse. Once again, it delivers especially on the visual side in terms of sets, cinematography and special effects while coming a bit short in terms of the story. The characters are all fairly memorable though, the human ones and the others. There are many many characters that appeared in the first film already, for example Obi Wan Kenobi is even back for one scene, but there are also some interesting new additions, most of all the uber-famous Yoda. And Darth Vader is the main villain in here while being just one of several villains in the first film. A great light saber sequence is included here too.I said that I was not too overwhelmed by the story and that implies the plot as a whole, but also minor scenes and references. One example would be Calrissian obviously being totally scared of Vader for almost the entire film and then, completely out of nowhere, he suddenly has no fear anymore and joins the resistance fighters. Not very realistic character development. I also did not like the references in terms of mathematical probability early on. This makes it look really unrealistic that Skywalker survived or that Han Solo managed to control the spacecraft some time later.All in all, it was in okay watch at best and the film has several lengths, starts off nicely with the snow planet scenes, gets worse, but gains some momentum again towards the end. However, I believe that they could have done without roughly 20 minutes and kept this movie at 105 minutes instead of over two hours. You have to be very generous to appreciate this film as a whole as there were more than just a few weaknesses to it. Still, the good moments make somewhat up for it, even if the film never reached real greatness. Not once. Nonetheless, I will be generous and give it a cautious thumbs-up, especially for science fiction fans, which I am probably not really."
22850,True,"This is the cream of the crop for not just the original trilogy, but the entire saga. To me, this film even surpasses the original. Everything is finally perfect, for just this one time. The tone is generally dark and somber, something Episode VI tried to live up to. But thanks to things called Ewoks it didn't quite keep the tone steady. The comic relief is given at the right moment and isn't over done.Rather, this film puts all the characters through their own turmoil and emotional battles. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher's love story is more drawn out and ends in a somewhat tragic way you could say. Luke, still played by good ole Mark Hamil, is finally on the road to becoming a Jedi Knight but his crusade against the Empire hits a stop as we find out one little detail left out in the previous one: ""Luke, I am your father.""""Nooooooo!!!! No!!!!!!"" Yes, Hamil could've done a little better here, but it doesn't take away from the moment as the horrible truth comes out. Lucas really outdoes himself here. Now the audiences can't wait for the third, and at the time, final installment. The action here is also well delivered, this film introducing much more environments than the last. The SFX are better than ever, especially on Hoth with the AT-TT Walkers and asteroid scene. The lightsaber duel at the climax is much improved from the rather stiff one in the original and we really see the extent of Vader's power. The music is, as always, superb, one of John William's best ever. Episode V is no less than epic."
22851,True,"Luke, Leia and Han are fighting with the rebels in the hope of defeating the Imperial forces. But Luke gets a calling to to the planet Dagobah, where under the tutelage of Jedi Master, Yoda, he hopes to become a Jedi himself, but that also brings him closer to his, and Leia's, destiny.Lets tell it as it is, The Empire Strikes Back is a better film than Star Wars, not as impacting of course, but most definitely better. Technically, in story telling and in tone, it holds up well today and certainly warrants the amount of times it crops up in best sequels debates. That it's not actually a sequel is irrelevant, it is of course the filler in a wonderful sci-fi sandwich, because as second instalments go, Empire has few peers. With Empire Strikes Back we get all the whizz bang adventure strewn heart of Star Wars, but George Lucas (stepping aside for Irvin Kershner to direct) has also fleshed the story out with a serious dark tone that oddly becomes a bedfellow to the romantic fun on offer, where new and engaging characters (and creatures) add spice to this wonderful fantastical broth.Aided by the considerable writing talent of Leigh Brackett (The Long Goodbye, Rio Bravo, The Big Sleep), Lucas took the bold and ingenious step of giving the bad guys the upper hand, in fact it could be argued that he was taking a considerable risk with his ending. Forcing his viewers to wait for the final chapter (three years later), after tantalisingly setting us up with a corker of plot twist (one which is still to this day as potent as it was back on release), Lucas pulled perhaps one of the cheekiest carrot dangles in cinema history.Tho more famed for its dark undertones, Empire is for sure still a very fun movie, C3PO goes into camp overdrive and Han Solo ups his quip quota by some margin. Then of course there is Yoda, in himself a comedic joy. The action sequences beg for repeat viewings, a battle on the ice laden planet Hoth is a marvel and the choreography for Skywalker's fight with Darth Vader is out of the top draw. But ultimately it's with the dark side that the picture excels. Complex and amazingly posing moral quandary's, The Empire Strikes Back is quite an experience, one that will forever hold up to repeat viewings for this particular viewer. 10/10"
22852,True,"This is the fifth part of my essay on the themes and motifs of Star Wars.The Empire Strikes Back is widely considered the best of the Star Wars movies and is one of the darkest. Released in 1980, it continued the story and contained what was, at the time, the most shocking moment in cinema history in the revelation of Luke Skywalker's parentage.Lucas' use of pairs of things continues to be strong motif. Luke is sent to Dagobah to train one-on-one with Yoda, hearkening back to the master-apprentice relationships of the glory days of the Republic. These scenes contain some of the best dialog in the series as Yoda explains the nature of life and the Force: ""We are luminous beings, not this crude matter."" One of my favorite moments in the entire series also occurs, as Luke beheads the apparition of Darth Vader whose mask disappears to reveal Luke's own face, foreshadowing the twist to come. After Luke abandons his training to save his friends, it is revealed by Yoda that there is in fact another who can save them (ie not one but two).Technology is once again presented as potentially dangerous and above all fallible. The Millennium Falcon is constantly in a state of disrepair and never seems to work properly at the most critical times: a classic motif of science-fiction. Technology is also demonized by the shadowy presence of Boba Fett and especially by the only semi-human Darth Vader.The climactic moment of this movie occurs in Cloud City, as Luke and Vader duel in a hellish chamber of smoke and red lights. Vader severs Luke's right hand (as his had been previously by Count Dooku) and reveals that he is Luke's father. Luke chooses to fall to his death rather than live with this truth but he is saved by deus ex machina. The omnipresent malevolence of technology rears its head thereafter, as Luke's hand is replaced with a mechanical one, making him just slightly more like his father and nemesis and leaving the viewer in doubt as to how the story will conclude.Criminally ignored in its time by the Academy, The Empire Strikes Back is likely the greatest film of the genre ever made and sets the stage for the conclusion of the greatest series of all time.10/10"
22853,True,"The characters, the drama, the comedy between Han & Leia. The special effects and of course the unforgettable introduction of Yoda. The best Star Wars film of them all and deserving of a place within the IMDb top 5. Harrison Ford establishes himself as one of the most masculine action heroes ever, setting a prelude for his amazing turn as Indiana Jones. The ending, which literally leaves the audience hanging made me love the story more and left me wanting to see more of this amazing epic. The unfortunate thing is that a film like Ordinary People, which was good, won the Oscar in 1980, but will not have nearly the impact on our culture or future film-making that both Episodes IV & V have and will continue to have."
22854,True,"Face it. Once you see ""Star Wars"" (or Episode IV, for all you ""Special"" Edition lovers) at least 54 times, everything sort of drags on. Once you see ""Return of the Jedi"", it kind of drags along, but, even though it is the longest, it seems to be the shortest. While ""Empire"" is VERY slow, it is easily the darkest and most enjoyable movie from the Original Trilogy, but for me, the least. As with ""Star Wars"" I'm gonna start the review with the Special Edition stuff. We don't need to see the ""VERY"" interesting approach to the Star Destroyer. The extra Wampa scene builds MUCH more tension than the original. And making Luke scream like a baby was Definitely cool. So, like the original ""Star Wars"" DON'T BUY OR WATCH THE SPECIAL EDITION! Again, I am proud to be the lucky owner of the original 3 movies unwrapped, and in mint condition after my success on ebay. I think it is obvious that The Empire Strikes Back is the darkest, including the fact that it has the stunning (MAJOR spoilers ahead!) ""I am your father!"" by James Earl Jones. As for the acting in this movie, second strongest, (Return of the Jedi has the strongest,in my opinion). Best actor/actress here- Frank Oz as Yoda. Well, he didn't really act, but oh, well. Againg, the effects in the Original Edition don't stick out like a sore thumb like in the Special Edition. The sets have gone a small, almost unnoticeable change: They don't look used! While many may argue that snow and woods can't look used (and I agree with them), Cloud City certainly can, and I think that there wasn't a scuff mark until the Stormtroopers attacked! Again, the music is GREAT! This time, my second favorite track, ""The Imperial March"" is introduced, and my fifth favorite, ""Yoda's Theme"" is introduced. Again, the DVD is fine (Luke doesn't scream), and I recommend it over the ""Special"" Edition. But, I recommend the Original Edition above all. May the Force be with you as you watch this movie!"

22856,True,"Despite having been a pretty big Star Wars fan as a kid and having had my love for the series rekindled to an extent by The Force Awakens, I have to say that this is an overrated movie. There was probably a lot of buzz surrounding it in the early eighties similar to the way The Dark Knight was treated upon its release. But I think that Empire is too flawed to deserve to be ranked as the thirteenth-best movie of all time. It ages okay, but some of the writing and acting are problematic, and it surprises me how forgiving viewers seem to be about these things.The two most glaring problems that I found with it were that 1. Mark Hamill cannot really act and 2. The movie does a rather poor job in how it cuts between the two groups of characters. I suppose Lawrence Kasden and company did not have the advantage of building off of things like Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones, which both do an excellent job in deciding how long to stay with each set of characters. Still, it messes up the pacing in a few spots.Even though this is hardly one of my favorite movies, I really wish I could have seen it without knowing anything about it. The first time I saw this at seven years old, I knew beforehand that Yoda was in it, that Han Solo got frozen in carbonite, and most importantly that Darth Vader was Luke's father. That didn't make it any less enjoyable to watch as a kid, but I would imagine that it would make me view the movie a lot differently if I hadn't grown up playing the Lego video games for it.This last time that I saw it, I found that the most interesting scenes were those in which Yoda trains Luke on the ways of the Force. I watched it with my little seven-year-old sister, and tried to explain to her that the Force is more of a philosophical thing rather than just a means of telekinesis because it took me a long time to realize that as a kid. Looking at it now, I'm realizing that the Force doesn't really have that many rules that it consistently follows.Normally I do recommendations at the end of this review, but that doesn't really seem necessary here so instead I'll use this space to share my feelings about the Last Jedi in the last few hours before it is released. Having just seen the Force Awakens, I'm actually rather excited. Kylo Ren seems like a really interesting villain that could see some good development in his second movie, especially in his dynamic with Rey. I'll be interested to see what old Luke Skywalker will be like. Most of all, I am excited to see what a Rian Johnson Star Wars movie will be like. Considering the way he handled time travel in Looper, I think his take on the Force and the sci-fi world of Star Wars could be really cool. Overall Rating: 7.2/10."
22857,True,"Star Wars instantly became en grained in popular culture when it first premiered. I could imagine the anticipation moviegoers had when the first sequel was released. Sequels rarely match or surpass the originals, but THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is considered the greatest sequels for good reason. Instead of rehashing the plot elements and formula from the first, it builds upon it, with more suspense and unexpected twists. Granted, in this case it was part of a lengthily saga that called for more than one movie to tell the entire story.Of the films from the original trilogy, RETURN OF THE JEDI has always been my personal favorite, but this one has a more compelling story with danger, excitement, solid character development, and the unexpected twists that would leave audiences anticipating more in the next installment.Luke's introduction to and training under Yoda has many iconic scenes and dialog. I was always amused when a swamp monster attempted to eat R2-D2 and then spit him out (""Luckily you don't taste very good""). Harrison Ford's performance as the cynical Han Solo is excellent as always. The romance that builds between him and Leia was entertaining. The best sequences were at the end, when Lando unwillingly sets up our heroes at the cloud city for Darth Vader. I like how C3PO is the first to become aware of it before the others do as well as the audience. I especially thought Lando's revelation to Leia and Han about Vader setting up a trap for Luke was well delivered. Luke's battle with Vader was epic and terrifying along with an iconic and frequently parodied revelation. His timely rescue by Leia and Landa foreshadowed another revelation for the following film.I can see why this has been a favorite among Star Wars fans. What makes this one especially strong is that it ends in a cliffhanger. I can also imagine audiences anticipating the next film to see what happened next."
22858,True,"Empire has long been known as the greatest Star Wars flick. I would say that Return of the Jedi would have beaten it for this title, if it had laid off the overdose of ewoks and buffoonery that populate the middle of the film, and lose sight of the otherwise excellent and violent epic being told. Empire was actually the very first SW film I ever saw as a child. I saw it sitting on a library shelf and Empire looked the best to me for some reason, even on the box. I took it home and was thrilled to see the huge Hoth snow battle right to start with. From there, I already felt immersed in the SW universe, though I hadn't seen the original.( I had played with toys and heard about it from friends.)Great music, great script, great action, and the crazy revelation after a light saber duel of Vader being Luke's father. Plus, Billy Dee Williams!!! Interaction between the silly droids and Chewbacca(but still felt cool, and not as childish as prequel nonsense). I remember Han Solo's line really surprising me, as I was only in about 2nd grade, when he replies to Leah's ""I love you,"" with ""I know"", as I had never heard anyone say this in a movie. I was expecting the usual ""I love you too."" It seems silly now, but for the time, Empire had some witty and sarcastic moments that are way better than other entries in the saga. Landing in a monster's mouth while running from the Empire through an asteroid field? Awesome, and the music and tension with that scenery are forever etched into my brain. John William is awesome. The Hoth scenery and Dagobah meeting with Yoda and Cloud City were all some of the best locations for Star Wars material. Everything about this film screams classic and epic greatness on many levels. Boba Fett and the mercenaries are introduced, and it leaves us with so many cliffhangers that it is utterly more exciting and suspenseful than IV and VI. I also had the old super Nintendo video game for Empire(and Return) and played them constantly."
22859,True,"i wanted to see the star wars trilogy and look at it with a critical eye. so when i watched this movie i expected anything. the movie was pretty fine and definitely an improvement over the previous one. though i don't have too much to say about this movie. i'd mostly say the same that i said about the first (fourth) one. so this review will be more or less minimal 1. the story: what i appreciate is that this is a ,,good'' sequel. it's what a sequel should be: a continuation. this is a pretty good continuation. it's not a rehash of the first one and the story itself is quite decent. also the most iconic star wars moments come from this movie. 2. the characters: the characters are for the most part. just like in the last one (especially the best character Han solo) but in this part Luke's character has actually grown a bit as he was learning to become a Jedi and use the ,,force'' or basically to become an omnipotent space wizard. Darth Vader and Chewbacca got to really shine in this movie and were infinitely better than in the predecessor. also Yoda was introduced and he was fine i guess. 3. the action: thankfully this movie didn't have a lot of storm-trooper shootout scenes. this is probably the biggest improvement over the last movie. the last movie had very boring action with no stakes since the storm-troopers literally miss every shot they take. here we only had one storm-trooper shootout and it was pretty quick. summary: fine movie. better than the last one but still grossly overrated. the biggest problem with these movies is that they are in the middle of kids movies and adult sci-fi"
22860,True,"Star Wars (1977) The first movie came to draw attention to the star wars universe, The Empire Strikes Back sealed the love of fans to the franchise. ""Luke, I am your father"" was one of the most exciting revelations in the cinema. So far, for me, the best film in the franchise."
22861,True,"What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said. Episode V is arguably the best in the series. The acting of Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo), and Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia) is superb. For a film from 1980 it still holds up extremely well. Perhaps this is due to George Lucas' writing, Irvin Kershner's directing, or John William's score. Most likely it's a combination of all three.The Empire Strikes Back is a markedly darker film than its predecessor or its successor. However, this is not a bad thing. The theme of darkness runs though out much of the movie. Any film where the bad guys win could easily have this theme just for that reason alone. The Empire Strikes Back does so much more though.Through the whole movie Han, Leia, and crew are on the run from the evil Empire. This makes the contrasting burgeoning love between Han and Leia so much more powerful. Two people who find a connection in dark times is a common theme, but in this film, it's not overdone. It's subtle and hints at their connection until the end. Luke also has his own darkness. On Dagobah, Luke trains to become a Jedi, like his father before him. However, shortly after finding Yoda, Luke encounters the cave where he sees and does battle with Darth Vader if only in his own mind. It turns out that he is facing the darkness in himself. This is really telling of the dark theme of the movie.Even the lighting of the movie adds to the theme. There aren't many bright scenes in this movie and even when there is, there is a looming sense of doom. In the beginning during the assault on Hoth, the planet may be bright and white, but we quickly find that the Empire has found them and will be attacking soon. Dagobah is a dark and foggy world full of mystery which matches the mystery behind the Jedi well. Cloud City on Bespin is almost lit like twilight and we learn that it is under the control of the Empire.The music and sound also contribute to the dark theme. Who can deny that the ominous sound of Darth Vader's breathing or amazing orchestrated music are responsible for much of the feelings we get in the movie. This film just wouldn't be the same without all of the work done by the sound engineers and music composers. If you still haven't seen this film and are looking at reviews to influence you I can only tell you to stop what you're doing and watch this. It's a masterpiece."
22862,True,"The movie that flipped the cinema world on its head. The most anticipated sequel of all time. Everything about this movie is bigger and better than the first. We go deeper into the galaxy and the characters that live in it. So many memorable scenes and lines that will leave you with a warm and broken heart. Empire proves that a sequel can be better than its predecessor. Although darker in tone, it never loses its sense of adventure and thrill that fans got in the original. And lets not forget the greatest twist in cinema history."
22863,True,"How do you top perfection? Why, you go out and you create the Empire Strikes Back, that's how. If the first Star Wars is merely the introduction, then Empire most certainly is the main course, the special effects were somehow more amazing, the story was far deeper, delving further into the mythology of the Skywalker saga, ""No, I am your father!"" anyone?What separates the first Star Wars from Empire,is the sheer fact that in Empire it seemed the whole cast and crew had more confidence and were far more comfortable with what they were doing. Whereas A New Hope seemed a little more shaky and adventurous, Empire exhumed total confidence, it explained more e.g. Vader being Luke's father, introduced the character of Yoda that had so far been a missing link in the story, it explained more about the great purge that had consumed the galaxy, what the galaxy had been like before the Empire through Obi-Wan and Yoda's eyes......It answered a lot of questions basically.The backdrops e.g. the locations, space itself, were kept in a similar vain to the previous film; dirty, desolate, it gave the impression that our heroes were truly lost out in the farthest reaches of the galaxy. For example, ever notice how the whole film revolved around the outskirts (outer rim) of the galaxy? And that not once in Empire or any of the original films (unlike the prequels) does the action venture into the heart of the galaxy, the heroes and the rebellion are marooned seemingly trying to fight from the outside in.For an outlandish and absurd sci-fi film, the characters are highly relate-able, in that their fight for justice is something we have all experienced in real life.On a visual note, the whole film was ahead of its time, the action in the beginning on planet Hoth was raw and other than the added additions of vehicles e.g. AT-AT walkers and snow speeders, the shield generator, echo base itself, the whole planet looked REAL, like they had landed in Antarctica on planet Earth. This contrasts Cloud City later in the film, this location looked purely CGI, nevertheless it was stunning and so outlandish, a city in the clouds surrounded by a gas mining facility, only in the realms of Sci- fi!The three main characters introduced in Empire that were absent from the previous film: Yoda, Lando and Boba Fett, all three were awesome and fantastic editions to the saga.Alas The Empire Strikes Back stands as my favourite ever film and for good reason, to find put why though you seriously need to invest some time in watching it, I implore you to do so."
22864,True,"I genuinely believe that Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes back is the greatest movie of all time. Besides it being superior to all other instalments of the Star Wars saga, it is superior to all other movies ever created. An amazing sequel to the film that kicked off the best entertainment franchise ever created, making an empire of its own.The acting is spot on, developing powerful characters such as Han, Leia and Vader. The film also introduced two amazing supporting characters to the universe, Yoda and Lando Calrissian. The story is one that can not be beaten. The biggest plot twist in cinema history was included, by Darth Vader revealing that he is Luke's father with the universally recognised quote ""No, I am your father"". The special effects are way ahead of the films time of release, earning Lucasfilm endless respect for their masterpiece. Overall, the movie, in my opinion, is absolutely class and no other film can beat it (well, no film that has been made yet).Fun fact: Only true fans of the saga would know this, but C-3PO is not all gold. The bottom half of his right leg is sliver."
22865,True,"An amazing film! truly carries Lucas's vision in a much realer light, everything i loved about the first ans more! a much darker and more gritty feel than the first but a great choice in tone following previous events. its a great display of Good versus evil and a great depiction of how the good guys don't always come out on top. as far as sequels go, it is by far one of the best, by carrying the intensity and story into a deeper and more rich environment. this is my favorite movie of all time and it's most definitely a 10/10!"
22866,True,"Star Wars: Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back is the second film in the episode Star wars original Trilogy and this one doesn't slow down the action or excitement, just like the original classic. This is a important film cause it shows the beginning romance between Han Solo and Princess Leia and you find out that Darth Vader is Luke's Father. This is an amazing film that all Star Wars geeks should see.I give 'Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back' a 9/10"
22867,True,"Yes this is the best that I believe Star Wars has to offer and this has to be the best movie sequel ever made as well, improving whereto original had already knocked it out of the park. Irvin Kershner at the time was an interesting choice as the director to the sequel of on of the biggest movies ever made, but what a fantastic choice is was. The reason why choosing Kershner as director was so brilliant was because of his background in film making. His films were much character driven with lots of emotion and heart to them, nothing that twas at the scale of Star Wars . Characters are ultimately what make Star Wars so great, its the attention to detail, wit, charm and interactions that make them so enjoyable to watch. Irvin not only delivers on this he excels and produces a Star Wars film that no one could have predicted. This film has such a good contrast between the shots in this film, however neither one carries the film more than the other. From the huge opening on Hoth to the more intimate moments between Han and Leia this never misses a beat. Next the story which is much much darker than the original film, and doesn't it work brilliantly with the subject matter at hand. The story has the rebellion on the run from there victory against the death star and they have been chased across the galaxy, the desolate world shows how desperate the rebels are. The story does has a lot of these small things that add up to one big overall theme of desperation and fear that holds you throughout the film. Which adds to the tension that know of the characters are safe form danger and that any one of them could killed any minute, fantastic tension builder. More broadly this film is dark,complex,interesting and rich. Not only does this film hit its infamous special effect action scenes but also knocks out of the park its emotion story line as well, a truly iconic film and story. If you thought that the groundbreaking special effects in Star Wars were amazing the sequel to that film somehow managed to better it. The opening battle on Hoth is one of cinemas greatest openings to a film and never lets down. The effects still to this day hold up and are a thrill to watch, it really shows the scope of this film. Ever single effect in this film doesn't look out of this place and adds an element of wonder at times and also horror, which is extremely effective in the scenes.There are two final positives of the film, firstly the performances in the film are brilliant. Needless to say that all of the returning cast are really good and also build on their characters from the first film. Not surprising there are two characters that have more of an impact in this film than others and those characters are Luke and Vader. From the training with Yoda to the showdown with Vader at the end of the film, Mark Hamill delivers a more mature aspect to the character who is ready to make the transition from rebel to Jedi. He also shows the physicality to match the change as well never showing physical weakness throughout the film. Vader, in the first film he was just the villain of the film and not much more. This film however elevates Vader to a new level and shows much more depth to the character that he was missing in the first film. He is everything he is in the first and more much much more. Oh yeah and he is Luke's father.......Oh spoiler alert for If you've been living under a rock, to be fair if you watch films 1 to 6 you already know that anyway before you reach 5. The film positive is once again the score by John Williams which is perfection, the score in this film adds so much in every scene no matter how small or big the scene is there is always a memorable theme to it through the score. Finally this film is the best Star Wars film and in my opinion wouldn't ever be beaten, 90 out of 100% a true icon of cinema and the best sequel in history. Director,story actors,effects and score are all at there top of their game none of them fault at once, true greatness!"
22868,True,"When talking about sequels that improved ten fold over their originals The Empire Strikes Back will always rightfully be mentioned because this is a film that takes its characters to whole new levels of intrigue and development and places them in a vulnerable position and is a masterpiece. For one this films opening is possibly the best of the entire franchise, we are perfectly re introduced to these characters and understand were they all are, we see exactly how they are dealing with the events of the first film and they brilliantly spend this first act building up to the Empires attack in Hoth which gives the battle itself a whole new level of intensity. This first battle is incredible, we feel the scale and power of the empire from all perspectives making you realise just how powerful they really are and how much the Rebel Alliance are up against. When we get past this battle the film is split into two separate arcs that are cut together and told perfectly, there's never a moment we're the audience is bored with either story as the characters along with the storytelling make both of them just as entertaining and satisfying as each other. Luke's time on Dagobah is incredibly intriguing, the way this film talks about the Jedi and The Force is extremely well done it makes them seem more deeper than mere warriors and the inclusion of Jedi Master Yoda was a very good way of emphasising this as it shows the enlightenment The Force can bring. The other arc of this movie cantering around Han Solo and Princess Leia on the run from the empire is extremely entertaining with seamless special effects and a much more intimate and character driven story than the previous instalment, the romance that eventually develops is done just right it feels natural as well as not forced and the chemistry between the two is impeccable. When we finally get to the last act of this film it's all come together perfectly to create for a nail baiting final show down. The fight between Darth Vader and Luke is absolutely incredible, not only the mental but physical war that goes on between the two is so satisfying, the famous reveal doesn't see out of field but plausible and the ending was not entirely satisfactory as it left the characters in a questionable position that sets up for a better place for a sequel. The Empire Strikes Back is not only one of the greatest sequels ever made but one of the greatest movies ever made, the characters are all given their own arcs, it's incredibly entertaining with seamless special effects and action sequences. This sequel builds on everything from the original and improves upon it making for a sci-fi masterpiece. 100%/A+"
22869,True,"It is my best film ever, it tops of course the the two first Madonna movies (Seeking Susan and Who is that girl in 1985/1987). Where to begin, the actors play well, they are charismatic, they assume what they are doing. It is a mixture of drama,love, passion, adventure and Darth Vador. He is the main antagonist of this episode of Star wars. The empire strikes back is a good title for this movie, as the rebels are in deep trouble. Luke is training to become a Jedi. I can spoil only one thing, that there is going to so much emotion in Bespin City (the cloud city). There is a two minute scenes which captures really well the spirit of the movie. So I would give it a rate of twenty out of ten. Eventough it is not possible."
22870,True,"Directed by Irvin Kershner, The Empire Strikes Back, like the original movie came out with mixed reviews with a difficult production, it's since then became considered one of the greatest film ever made. The film is set three years after the events of Star Wars IV: A New Hope where Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has studying the Force under exile Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz). Mid while, Darth Vader (voice by James Earl Jones), is in pursuit of him and the rest of the Rebel Alliance. When his friends are capture, Luke Skywalker must confront the man that kill his mentor, and save his comrades. This gritty movie was once criticize for its darker tone, and cliffhanger ending, but I love it, it really put all the characters to their limits both physically and emotionally, dealing with deceptive allies and make you want to watch the next movie. That's great filmmaking. Like its predecessor, The Empire Strikes Back draw from mythologist Joseph Campbell's book The Hero with a Thousand Faces, directly in it's tales that is taken right off from several mythological like Arthurian, classical Greco-Roman and others. There are similar motifs taken from other films and television shows like 1936's Flash Gordon, 1975's Dersu Uzala, and others worth noticing in the film. The movie even took influence from historic events like Nazism, the Wild West, and Samurai culture. It even dig into world religions. Some people might seeing the teaching of Yoda as boring scenes, but I love them. The movie really makes good on explaining more about what the Force is. The Force remind me of a new age amalgam of various eastern religious and western philosophical sources. A sense of Manichaeism, mixed with elements of Ralph Waldo Emerson's Romantic nature worship, Pantheism and Western-influenced Buddhism. Luke is not as annoying as the previous movie, as the film is mostly about his growth to maturation and self-discovery, but he does have some awful whining in this movie that makes you want to slap his face. Yoda in this movie works with the puppetry. The way Frank Oz performed and voiced him, made this character stand out. Not once, did I think it was a puppet. I would say, this was way better than the CGI Yoda or the puppet from Episode 1, big time! Industrial Light and Magic really pull it off, the action scenes in this film. This movie really make the Hoth Battle look real and intense. Another big prop to them is how great, Cloud City looks. As the technology has improved, Lucas has continued to tinker with the films, adding more creatures and more detail to the backgrounds and even reshooting certain scenes to get them closer to his ideal vision. In my opinion, this is one of the film that didn't get ruin by the 1997's Special Edition with pointless added scenes or badly done 1990's CGI. Glad, they didn't add the bad delete Wampa scenes. The Special Edition in my opinion, honestly, made it better. A good example of this is Cloud City. You really see more of the city than the original. It's beautiful. The 2004 version hurt the film a bit, changing Boba Fett's voice, but at less they add the real Emperor. The music by John Williams is great. I love the Imperial march introduced in The Empire Strikes Back as the theme music for Vader's pursuit of Han and Leia. The march's rhythm is driving and relentless, capturing Vader's own relentless progress through the story. For action, it's not as epic as 1977's Star Wars, but the story is way better than that movie. The love story in this film seem more realistic than the fairy tale love affair in Episode 2. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fischer) are just amazing in their roles, and give the movie, it's really needed humor. You know that they kinda dislike each other, but slowly they found caring for each other. That's realistic. The love affair had a shade of grey to it. One memorable exchange of dialogue was partially ad-libbed in which the character professed their love with Han Solo given a badass reply. That was amazing! Without spoiling it, the whole cliffhanger about Han Solo was at least in part due to the fact that they were not sure that Harrison Ford would return for a third film. I glad he did. Another thing, good about the writing is that there isn't a lot of dumb things that question logic in this film, like the other films. I did find a few. I don't like the whole Leia kissing Luke thing. It makes no sense even if Episode VI wasn't made at the time. It's still gross. Another one is how Ben Obi Won Kenobi (Alec Guinness) hide the truth from Luke, throughout the film for no good reason. Why!? You would have thought that information would help Luke deeply before heading to Cloud City! It doesn't make any sense. Once again, without spoiling it. During production, there was great secrecy surrounded the truth about Darth Vader & Luke Skywalker's relationship, to the point that most of the crew didn't know about it. I like how George Lucas fought for this movie. To preserve the dramatic opening sequences of his films, Lucas put the screen credits in the end. Even though this is more common now, this was a highly unusual choice at the time as the Writers and Directors Guilds felt that the credits should be shown first. They fined him and attempted to pull the movie out of theaters. Due to the controversy, he left the Guilds, and the Motion Picture Association. He also left 20th Century Fox over controversy when the President Alan Ladd Jr. got fired for helping fund the sequel, which cause Fox to lose Raiders of the Lost Ark's film rights. Overall: George Lucas change movie history with this film and the world is better because of it."
22871,True,"Many people think that 'The Empire Strikes Back' is the best of the original three, but I still vote the original higher. Still, for a film without a real beginning, middle, or end, this one is darn good.Frank Oz' puppetry really reached an apex in the early 1980s, with films like 'Dark Crystal' and 'Empire.' No wonder Yoda made the cover of Time magazine (as Star Wars did several times). The original Yoda is much more whimsical and playful than the 'earlier' Yoda of Episodes I-III. He toys with Luke while dispensing vaguely Confucian wisdom. The facial articulation is very good, and there is a certain palpable reality in physical special effects and good puppetry that the later digital Yoda just did not quite reach; besides the fact that Oz was obviously instructed by Lucas to keep it more serious.Then there is the Oedipal turn the story takes: ""Luke, I am your father."" I was actually surprised in 1980 when I saw this, and over the years I have gone from judging it corny to a masterstroke. It's probably both. For those who saw Star Wars pre-1980, it's clear that this was not the original plan. Interestingly, George Lucas has done some cleaning up of older movies to conform to the later canon (all but cutting a Luke-Leia kiss in the original that was just not quite brotherly-sisterly enough), but left a lot of it alone, like Obi Wan providing minimal explanation for his 'subterfuge' in the original Star Wars movie. Like in a good Charles Dickens novel, everyone turns out to be related to everyone or have met the person who did the thing who helped the other who...Other than Yoda and that revelation, the story that takes Luke from ice planet Hoth to be trained by Yoda and finally confront his Dark Side in the form of his father for the first time, does not have too many exciting turns or characters. Calrissian was planted in it for political correctness as a Han Solo scoundrel duplicate (I'm grateful though because Billie Dee was a pretty good scoundrel). Han literally gets frozen while Lando takes over for a while, as though there's not room for two of them.Still, I have to give it an 8. It is skillfully crafted for a middle piece, and Lucas really honed his special effects magic some more since the first installment. It's as enjoyable to see now as in the 80s, and its lower density special effects are almost prophetic of what is to come again: special effects that serve the film, not the other way around."
22872,True,"""The Empire Strikes Back'' is the best of three Star Wars films, and the most thought-provoking. After the space opera cheerfulness of the original film, this one plunges into darkness and even despair, and surrenders more completely to the underlying mystery of the story. It is because of the emotions stirred in ""Empire'' that the entire series takes on a mythic quality that resonates back to the first and ahead to the third. This is the heart of the original Star Wars trilogy.Entirely apart from the story and the plot, the film is worth seeing simply for its sights. Not for the scenes of space battle; but watch it for such sights as the lumbering, elephant-like Imperial Walkers. Or for the Cloud City, on its spire high in the sky. Or for the face of a creature named Yoda, whose expressions are as convincing as a human's, and as subtle. Or for the vertiginous heights that Luke Skywalker dangles over, after nearly plunging to his death.There are a couple of amusing subplots, one involving Han's easily wounded male ego, another about Vader's knack of issuing sudden and fatal demotions. Then comes the defining moment of the series. Can there be a person alive who does not know (read no further if you are that person) that Luke discovers Darth Vader is his father? But that is not the moment. It comes after their light saber duel, when Luke chooses to fall to his death rather than live to be the son of Vader.In the glory days of science fiction, critics wrote about the ""sense of wonder.'' That's what ""The Empire Strikes Back'' creates in us. Like a lot of traditional science fiction, it isn't psychologically complex or even very interested in personalities (aside from some obvious character traits). That's because the characters are not themselves  they are us. We are looking out through their eyes, instead of into them, as we would in more serious drama. We are on a quest, on a journey, on a mythological expedition. The story elements in the ""Star Wars'' trilogy are as deep and universal as storytelling itself. Watching these movies, we're in a receptive state like that of a child--our eyes and ears are open, we're paying attention, and we are amazed."
22873,True,"After Star Wars was a smash hit in 1977, a sequel was put into the works. The Empire Strikes Back is one of those sequels that is equal to the original, while still being its own film. While I can't personally say it's the best film of the Saga, it comes pretty darn close.As with any second film in a trilogy, we begin after an unspecified amount of time following the Battle of Yavin. The rebels are discovered on the ice planet Hoth, and are promptly defeated by the Imperial Walkers. Our main group is split up into separate teams. Luke, following advice from the force ghost of Obi Wan, seeks out the wise teacher Yoda (a puppet played in a stunningly real performance by puppeteer Frank Oz) who teaches him the true power and meaning of the Force. Leia and Han, along with Chewie, Threepio and R2, are pursued by the Empire for use as bait in a trap by Darth Vader.For a film that has no real beginning or end story-wise, this film has more emotion and character study, exactly what George Lucas and director Irvin Kershner wanted. During his experiences with Yoda, Luke develops an inner conflict about Darth Vader and the Dark Side, and that he must confront this evil in a duel. We as an audience also learn the power of the Force, which is further strengthened as a religious idea, such as Yoda's line, ""You must FEEL the force AROUND you."" Such material is what makes Empire great, is that we move deeper and deeper into darker and more thoughtful thematic material. The real interesting part of this film is the big reveal in the third act, where Vader reveals Luke's true parentage. It is simply one of the greatest scenes to ever grace the movie screens, and such an emotional pull that we still get lost in the moment even though we all know who he is now.On the opposite side, the stuff on Leia and Han's side of the film is good, but not great. Let me explain. The love story is actually very well done. There's not a lot of smooching and sappy sentiment, but it happens very naturally, along with some banter. Harrison Ford also delivers one of the best improvised lines when Leia says ""I Love You."" he simply says, ""I know."" Those are actors who really know their characters. But the rest it seems just to be ""funny"" or unnecessary annoyance. Chewie and Threepio fit into this category, though Threepio is far more interesting than Chewie so... I guess I give him a pass.The rest of the movie is pretty good. The effects are unbelievable, the music is perfect, with John Williams giving us the universally loved ""Imperial March,"" and the terrifying lightsaber duel between Vader and Luke being the highlight of the entire film.Its one of the best of the Saga. I say ""one of the best"" because, for me, this ties with two of the other films, Episodes VI and III. All three of these films are on the top of the game and great films to watch. Onto the first in the sort of ""lackluster films the fans love to rip to shreds..."
22874,True,"This is it my favorite movie of all time, now I'm not saying it's the best, because that honor belongs to The Godfather, this is more my opinion than anything else. So why do I like it so much, well nostalgia is a key factor, I was 8 when this came out, and it was even better than the first one, the stakes were higher, it was darker, and it had one of the greatest twists ever (beaten only by The Usual Suspects, and The Sixth Sense). It was just great, like the first one, while adding great new things to the tables. It is my favorite movie of all time, and it is without a doubt a timeless classic.it is a 10/10."
22875,True,"You've gotta admire George Lucas' moxie. It was bold enough that he sought out to self-finance ""The Empire Strikes Back"", but the movie has to be a downer on top of it. Make matters worse, he ends on one humdinger of a cliffhanger that people had to wait 3 years for resolution. That's sheer balls. But what a terrific movie it is. For one, it surpasses the original, which is rare in the sequel department. But it also takes its time to let the story unfold, characters get fleshed out, and the whole thing's a stirring mix of humor, drama and action. Yoda's scenes are some of my favorite of the trilogy. Frank Oz was able to lend that puppet such a personality that it simply becomes a wizened old Jedi master and not a special effect. And Darth Vader's presence in this movie makes him one of the all0time great movie villains. He's unhinged, choking out underlings left and right, and pursuing Luke with reckless abandon. Badass seems kind of trite, but it fits here. ""The Empires Strikes Back"" is a movie that just fires on every last cylinder. Great dialogue, suspense, set pieces and production values. For my money, it's John Williams' finest score, and the movie continues to be one of my absolute favorites (not to mention the best of the trilogy). 10/10"
22876,True,"The fifth installment to one of the greatest film franchises on the planet. Not only just an all around great movie but home to one of the greatest moments in film history when Darth Vader, after battling Luke, informs him that he is his father. The film has many classic moments people know by heart some who haven't even seen the full saga. It's amazing how certain moments are known by people worldwide without even seeing the full movie. Just another look at George Lucas's brilliance in film making. Although he is no longer in the making of the next few films set to come out over the next few years, after seeing the great remakes of star trek i'm confident J.J. Abrams will do a good job in keeping not only the classic feeling there but also adding more to an already fantastic franchise."
22877,True,"I think this movie is the best Star Wars movie ever.The story of the movie and character selection is very good.The effects of the movie is good for this years.There are some errors in the film, but they can be ignored.The musics in the movie is great.I think Imperial March is the best movie music.It reflects dark side very well.Also I love the sound of light-saber.Need to be tied to violate the laws of physics in order to facilitate expression. Because the planet of the Star Wars like The Arabian Nights tale. Lucas doesn't conform to the realities of his own creation universe, but it is sinking me this moments.You absolutely watch this film."
22878,True,"This brilliant film wastes no time telling it's elaborate story. I was 9 years young when my father took me to see this in the theater. Back then you had to stand in line to see the soonest showing because it only showed once at a time, but boy was it ever worth it. What can possibly be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? How many other movies can you think of where the sequel is just as good, if not better, than the first? I can think of only three; The Godfather Part II, Terminator 2 and Superman 2. It's hard to believe that this film wasn't even nominated, considering The Return Of The King was not only nominated but won best picture; different times I guess. At the time there were a few scenes that shocked me; Han's freezing and the look of him, Luke losing half his arm and right after that learning that Vader is his father. Wow! I recall the scene where Luke goes into that tunnel and light sabers Vader's head off to reveal his own face, scaring the crap out of me. Another thing that was big back then was the merchandising. Lucas got a ton of money from my parents because of this franchise. I had everything that ever came out from trading cards, action figures to even bed sheets. God I wish I had it all still and in it's original packaging. And having just watched this, probably for the 2nd dozenth time, I can tell you that it still holds the test of time. So watch it again, preferably the original version in surround sound at a good loud level for the 2 hours and 4 minutes of it's running time and enjoy and American sci-fi classic."
22879,True,"After being abruptly evicted from his Death Star digs, Darth Vader seeks out the young rebel warrior responsible, Luke Skywalker. He has plans for the boy. Skywalker, meanwhile, leaves his friends in the middle of an Imperial invasion for a crash course in Jedi Knighthood amid a desolate swamp world with only a faultfinding green gnome for company. Can Luke complete his training before Darth reels him in?Well, no, actually. That's not the only way this middle installment of the ""Star Wars"" trilogy leaves things on a decidedly more discordant note than the previous, joyous ""Star Wars."" People call this the darkest of the original three films because it is, but ""Empire"" is the only one with an adult orientation. The characters are deepened, and our investment in them from the first film challenged by events that leave them exposed to the sort of cruelties we wrongly assumed them safe from.George Lucas deserves major praise for putting such a film together, using his well-earned profits from the first film. In essence, he was literally giving the fans back some dividends for their box office proceeds. He also took chances in terms of leaving them less happy this time, knowing the emotional payoff would have to come a film later.""Empire Strikes Back"" is thus a richer film than ""Star Wars"" emotionally, and in other ways, too. Instead of confining most of the action to the desert planet Tatoonie, the action bounces around from an ice planet to a swamp planet to the most marvelous creation of all, a city hovering high in the clouds of a gas giant, where the action culminates.Lucas adds some interesting new characters, particularly Yoda, the swamp creature Luke goes to for help, who articulates much of the philosophy and provides much of the fun in this film as voiced by Frank Oz, the guy behind (or under) Miss Piggy and later, a talented director in his own right.There's also Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian, the operator of Cloud City who provides much of the needed moral shading in the film as the stars from the previous movie are all full-blown heroes now. Williams has fun schmoozing up Leia and trying to find his feet as his slick machinations leave him in ever-hotter water.The best performance in this film is Mark Hamill's as Luke. Hamill had to work harder here than he did in ""Star Wars,"" sharing all his big scenes with a Muppet and a guy with a bucket on his head. But Hamill finds the essence of a character more interesting than the naive farm boy we saw in the first film, playing Luke as confused, fearful, impetuous, and flawed in a way that makes him more likable, rather than less so. How Hamill never hit it big after his great work here is an injustice on par with Cleavon Little's lack of work after ""Blazing Saddles.""What else about this is great? The score by John Williams, introducing the recognizable ""Imperial March"" theme music as well as some rousing material during the final confrontation between Luke and Darth. The interaction between Vader and his subordinates is chokingly funny, in a way that only adds to the suspense and dread. The opening battle around the ice planet is marvelously intense, especially as witnessed from the cockpits of Rebel fighters taking on thickly-armored Imperial walkers.The returning cast except for Hamill doesn't seem as sharp this time, especially Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia, so charming in ""Star Wars,"" gaunt and miserable here. Much of the whole middle section of the film is draggy and woolly, like the various silly ways the Millennium Falcon escapes Imperial pursuit and the scene in the ""cave"" that goes on much longer than it should. Even Luke's scenes with Yoda become slow and tedious with multiple viewings.The enthusiasm that makes ""Empire Strikes Back"" so beloved today is understandable. It turned ""Star Wars"" from a great film into an enjoyable franchise. But it doesn't really have the same stand-alone quality ""Star Wars"" has, needing both that earlier film and the later ""Return Of The Jedi"" to make it as great as it is."
22880,True,"I, like so many others of my generation, grew up with this movie. I remember watching it on a scruffy VHS and being in awe the whole time. There are so many magical moments - how Luke escapes from the lair of the hairy beast, how Han realizes he flew inside a space monster's maw, how Darth Vader suffocates the admirals who keep failing him, how Yoda raises the X-Wing from the bog, how Han is frozen in carbonite, and of course the ending's Big Reveal of cinema history.Though I love all the old Star Wars movies, this one really takes the cake. It has a perfect balance of whimsical adventure and darker moments (battles, betrayals, even torture). The dialog is really iconic, featuring the famous Yoda-speech and the quips between Han and Leia.The remastered edition is absolutely gorgeous. The film is colorful and sharp and the special effects look fine, never really distracting you from the experience. I wish they used more of these practical effects (models, animatronics, costumes) nowadays."
22881,True,"This movie was awesome! I loved the characters (Vader was my favourite).I loved the story (Including the plot twist with Darth Vader the father of Luke Skywalker).And I loved the visuals (For a 1980 movie, the effects are brilliant).And it's kinda funny this movie wasn't directed by George Lucas (Instead it's directed by Irvin Kershner while George was the executive producer).My favourite scene in this movie would have to be The Battle of Hoth because the soundtrack, visuals and acting were all spot on.Speaking of the soundtrack, John Williams must've had a wonderful time creating the pieces of music in this film.I would highly recommend you see this movie (Either on TV or a DVD), you'll have a wonderful time."
22882,True,"This movie is so amazing for so many reasons but the one thing I have to say is the greatest is that the bad guys are winning the entire time. Lucas had to capture his audience in the first film and no one likes a film where the bad guys wins. However once he had established the rebellion and set up the characters he was free to do some good guy bashing.You know who the good guys and bad guys are, you know how these types of stories typically end (with the good guys winning) so you know that no matter what happens in the middle movie, it has to end well. With that in mind, why not make the rebels lose, cut off Luke's hand, and freeze Han in carbonite. It keeps the watching at the edge of his seat wanting to know whats going to happen."
22883,True,"I would argue, as would many others, that this is the best of all six Star Wars films. I mean, it's just got so many awesome components to it. Firstly, there's the change in Leia and Han's relationship. Their previous banter throughout Episode IV, and the first half of this film, almost begs for the two of them to end up together. And I'm really glad that they did at the moment when they did, because to be honest, their constant jibes at each other were getting a bit annoying. Thanks to that carbon-freezing chamber, they stop bickering and eventually end up together. Next, there's Yoda. I'm pretty sure Star Wars would not be nearly as successful as it is without this little green creature. He's completely insane at first (a stark contrast with the prequel trilogy), and it really works in this light. He's the crazy master that Luke has to follow because Obi-Wan trusts him, and despite all of the crazy, he's very lovable and quite awesome.There are so many other things in this film that I could mention, because there is so much of merit here. I could talk in great detail about Hoth, AT-ATs, Cloud City, Obi-Wan visions and of course Lando Calrissian. However, there is one major plot point which I want to talk about, which is the famous ""I am your father"" twist. (I would say SPOILER, but please!) I have previously commented on the extensive use of twists in the plot of Star Wars, and the fact that you can't be sure what was decided on originally, and what was a late addition. I do believe, however, that this twist was thought up in the original story, when Episode IV was being written. Having watched ""A New Hope"" knowing about it, there are a lot of things said which hint at the fact that Vader is Luke's real father. It is also completely spoiled if you've seen any of the prequels Despite the fact that it's now become a complete cliché, it still works well in the film, and later becomes a useful plot point in the climax of Episode VI."
22884,True,"Star Wars has always and will always be my favorite movie saga of all time. Not only does it capture my imagination like no other series but it also has one of the greatest story lines of all time. Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back is one of my favorites of the six. It seriously emphasizes the idea of the archetypal hero with Luke meeting the great Yoda who trains him to be able to fulfill his destiny by confronting Vader. Another Favorite aspect is the legendary scene when Vader tells Luke he is his father. Episode V has many legendary movie moments that are known by pretty much everyone. It also greatly shows the connection between both Vader and Luke the many differences and similarities. Anakin was mainly full of anger and fear, both characteristics appear in Luke, but the feelings of knowing what is right and the discipline that Luke shows when he confronts his father is definitely a characteristic of his mother. We never really were able to put that together until the 3 prequels were made. Episode V will always be in the top numbers of legendary movies in America full of unforgettable classic movie moments and fun."
22885,True,"released in 1980, the sequel to George Lucas's mega-hit Star Wars. The Empire Strikes back is the penultimate science fiction experience, aside from flying a space ship and shooting aliens out of the sky yourself!The rebellion is in full swing and trouble brews for Luke, Leia and Han. Luke is called to Dagobah to train under the mysterious Yoda and parts ways with Leia and Han (temporarily). Han and Leia make their way to Hans old mate, Lando Calrissian in Cloud City.soon enough, Luke sense his friends in danger and makes his way to Cloud City, much to Master Yoda protests. Leading Luke into a face to face encounter with an old nemesis, and a dramatic reveal known as the biggest twist in history!so much happens in this magnificent film, enough to make it my favourite of the original saga.a must watch for Sci-Fi fans, or even movie fans."
22886,True,"Just as cutting edge as the first instalment of this classic and innovative sci-fi series, and just as cinematically compelling. Some would argue that 'Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back' is even better than its predecessor, but in most aspects it is merely a strong, steady and solid 'part two' to an epic three-part story.George Lucas still does a powerful job in the sequel, along with the famous addition of Frank Oz's Yoda and a fantastic screenplay/story basis; this is excellent in all marks of what makes a movie great. The regulars are still there, the protagonists and antagonists, making this just as lovable as 'A New Hope', along with the debut of Lando Calrissian and the story-arc and exploration of Hans and Leia.While the entire story is a great work, the film is perhaps most notable for the big scene where it is revealed that Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father, a scene which has gone on to become both memorable and quotable, along with the awesome moment when the reveal is said by Darth Vader and 'The Imperial March' starts playing.Time has shown that most movie franchises don't produce particularly great sequels, let alone trilogies, but hats off to George Lucas for doing it right with 'Empire', what a classic!"
22887,True,"Not only is 'Empire' as good as the original 'Star Wars', it surpasses it by light years.Taking place a couple of years after the first movie, the rebellion have made their headquarters on the remote ice planet of Hoth. The Empire find them and after an epic battle, our heroes go their separate ways. Luke and R2-D2 go to the swamp planet of Dagobah in search for a powerful warrior known as Yoda who will complete Luke's Jedi training and Han, Leia, Chewie and C-3PO are being pursued by the Empire across space.All the actors playing the main characters in the original make a return in this and have all improved over time, especially Mark Hamill who I personally felt was the weakest actor in the original (Not saying that his acting was bad, just not as good as it is here.) The budget was much higher for this movie than the last, allowing for even greater special effects and more lavish and highly detailed sets. For example, The interior of the Millennium Falcon is expanded upon and we get to see all the intricacies of the ship, it's great stuff.John Williams also returns as composer. We hear some of the classic music from the first movie as well as some new stuff which is just as good as you would expect.Overall, one of the greatest sequels in movie history, with more production value, more action, a more mature and darker storyline and having probably the most famous twist in movie history. If you enjoyed the first 'Star Wars' and have not seen this yet, then there is something wrong with you. Seriously."
22888,True,"I'll admit to not being one of the ""cool"" people (as in cool nerds) who like this installment of Star Wars better than the first because it's darker and takes itself more seriously. Escapist movies such as Star Wars and Raiders shouldn't take themselves too seriously, and it hurts Empire a bit..but just a bit. This is still a fun ride. That said, it does take Empire a lot longer to get out of the gate than the the first one did. After a long slow buildup, there's that great battle scene on the ice planet Hoth (where we first see the Imperial walkers). After getting driven from Hoth, two stories emerge: While Han Solo, Princess Leia, C3PO and Chewbacca are hiding from Darth Vader in an asteroid field, Luke Skywalker(with R2D2) is off on this rat hole of a planet in the Degaba system to learn about the Force (he gets a vision from Obi Wan early in the movie telling him to go there). This brings us to a character beloved by a majority of Star Wars fans yet reviled by me. I'm of course talking about the sanctimonious muppet (later CGI image) Yoda. Despite the fact that I found his character so annoying, the detail with regard to Yoda's facial expressions (his eyes in particular) was amazing back in a time long before CGI. Luke starts to learn about the Force (in what must be a crash course when you compare it to the ""prequels""), but leaves when he sees visions of his friends in trouble, and despite Yoda's admonishments, goes to help them. This is where Luke starts getting irritating. He knows Vader is setting a trap for him, yet lets his emotions totally get the best of him and goes anyway. Makes you wonder if you want to leave the future of the galaxy in the hands of someone this flaky.Luke isn't quite as much fun as he was in the first one, but the other characters make up for it. The back and forth between Han and Leia is even funnier than in the previous movie. In fact, this movie is Solo's finest hour (good thing, because the subsequent carbon freeze he went through apparently softened his brain). If you wanted to take the essence of everything I love about Solo and bottle it, it would come down to two words: I know. Speaking of which, the love story between Han and Leia (which culminated in those two words) was handled just right..the movie didn't dwell on it, though the sexual tension was evident in the way the two of them sniped at each other early on.Darth Vader was his bad self..even more in this movie than the first one (and even less patient with fools, as a couple of imperial officers found out the hard way). The fight between Luke and Vader in the 2nd half was where the movie started to degenerate into taking itself too seriously. Star Wars doesn't do as well when it gets too dramatic. The visuals are great though.Rounding out rest of the characters, Billy Dee Williams is fine as Han's old pirate buddy Lando, though his character and Solo's were pretty similar. Then there was the single most over-hyped character in Star Wars, Boba Fett (I think he had all of two lines). C3PO and R2D2 were great, but they were separated for much of this movie..they work better together. Chewbacca's best moment was early in the movie when he was laughing at Solo after Leia insulted him..It bugged me for a long time that this movie didn't really end..that it left you hanging for three years until the next one came out (as in leaving Han Solo in carbon freeze). I finally got past that, realizing that in a sense it does ""end""..our heroes live to fight another day, but only after taking a serious beating for most of the movie. Though I didn't like it as much as the first, Empire was still a worthy effort. 8.5"
22889,True,"After the classic Star Wars (as it was originally called in 1977) he knew that there would be a chance of a sequel that could outmatch it,but the Empire Strikes Back did just that with skill and the intensity of the suspense that was put into the audience and even the greatest turn of events in movie history ever,just the plot of this film put me onto the edge of my seat for most of the film. I still imagine putting myself in the action at the Battle of Hoth and meeting the cool and lovable Yoda that many even non star wars fans have come to adore and just the intensity when Luke fought Darth Vader and found out he was his father changed the way I looked at films made me want more and I still find this better than the first and will ever praise this film."
22890,True,"After I watched Episode IV, I had high hopes for this movie and thankfully it did not disappoint me at all. The very first scene once again got me into the movie with Luke Skywalker patrolling the Hoth base. Immediately, we are thrown into mystery and suspense. Slowly, Lucas reveals certain things and Luke is attacked. We are then told of a hidden Rebel base on the snowy mountain of Hoth. After a probe droid investigates the area, its destroyed and this gives the Empire a chance to get revenge on the destruction of the Death Star.Han Solo continues to be a mystery. He seems like he may just leave, but turns back to save the day. That scene with Luke using all the power he had to get the lightsaber off the snow was one legendary scene as the music build up just steals it! The Battle of Hoth then ensues. Again, it doesn't focus on SPECIAL EFFECTS. And we see some AT-AT's and some Rebel ships led by Luke Skywalker. We see a new Imperial leader by the name of Veers. The tension is in the air for some really special film.After Han, Leia and Chewie along with the two droids escape Hoth from Vader, we are immediately into the story. Vader pursues the Millennium Falcon and hires bounty hunters to bring Han to him in order to get Luke to the dark side (that's after they figure out he's strong with the force). Luke goes to Dagobah and every scene there had something very special. The scene with Yoda lifting up Luke's TIE fighter was one legendary scene. This WAS the Yoda. A mystery to all. His quote ""size matters not"" has now being destroyed in the prequels where he jumps around to make up for his size.Eventually, Luke falls for Vader's trap and gets himself to Bespin. Han is betrayed by his friend Lando to Vader. Vader prepares to carbonate him and test it to see if it will kill or not. After Han is frozen, Luke arrives and sets for the most legendary lightsaber duel of all time (Not that prequel crap).This scene between Luke and Vader has so much tension and emotion that the prequels lacked. The scenes with Lando, Leia and Chewie getting off Bespin was also cool. I mean, how much cooler could Lando be? He's the second best SW character to me now! Eventually the film ends on a cliff hanger setting the events of Episode VI. This worked well and ends my review of one of the all time best films."
22891,True,"Along with the first Star Wars movie ever made, I absolutely love this movie very, very much! It reunites all your favorite characters from Star Wars and the people who played them. What is this movie about this time? Let's take a look...It is the time of crisis for the Rebel Alliance after the Battle of Hoth. After Luke Skywalker and his friends escape from the clutches of the evil Imperial Empire, Luke meets the mysterious Jedi master Yoda, and must battle against Darth Vader at Cloud City. Also, Darth Vader reveals a terrible secret to Luke that will even leave Star Wars fans speechless? What is the secret? The Battle of Hoth is absolutely epic, the special effects are amazing, the music is extravagant, and all the characters are very, very wonderful! Starring Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fischer as Princess Leia, Billy Dee Williams as Lando, Harrison Ford as Han Solo, Frank Oz as Yoda, and James Earl Jones as Darth Vader."
22892,True,"Star Wars Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back is a masterpiece in film, easily one of the best science fiction movies, and one of the best films of all-time. Better than The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith, A New Hope, and Return of the Jedi combined. Simply incredible. It introduces some of my favorite Star Warscharacters, including Boba Fett and Lando Calrissian. It has classic scenes like Han Solo getting frozen in carbonite, the Battle Of Hoth, the fight between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker which includes the classic line, 'I am your father'. This film is perfect for Star Wars fans, science fiction fans, fans of film, and fans of great stories in general."
22893,True,"Out of the original Star Wars movies(Episodes IV,V,VI) this is by far the best of them. George Lucas had more of a hands off approach with this movie then he did with A New Hope. The movie has a much darker tone to it then ANH or Return of the Jedi were.This movie is the first movie to see the introduction of 2 significant characters in the Star Wars pantheon with Yoda and Emperor Palpatine.The movie has multiple different locations with the Hoth system(ice planet), Dagobah(tropical planet), asteroid and cloud city.The movie ends with a few gigantic cliffhangers like Darth Vader telling Luke that he's his father and Han Solo being frozen in carbonite."
22894,True,"The second entry in George Lucas' Star Wars trilogy entitled,Star Wars: Episode V:The Empire Strikes Back finds Luke Skywalker, the green-as- grass hero from the first film,Star Wars:A New Hope,now a seasoned space warrior.This epic space opera film directed by Irvin Kershner. The screenplay, based on a story by George Lucas, was written by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan. Of the six main Star Wars films, it was the second to be released and the fifth in terms of internal chronology.The film is set three years after Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. The Galactic Empire, under the leadership of the villainous Darth Vader, is in pursuit of Luke Skywalker and the rest of the Rebel Alliance. While Vader chases a small band of Luke's friendsHan Solo, Princess Leia Organa, and othersacross the galaxy, Luke studies the Force under Jedi Master Yoda. But when Vader captures Luke's friends, Luke must decide whether to complete his training and become a full Jedi Knight or to confront Vader and save his comrades.Luke's Star Wars cohorts Han Solo and Princess Leia are likewise more experienced in the ways and means of battling the insidious Empire, as represented by the brooding Darth Vader. And, of course, ""The Force,"" personified by the ghost of Luke's mentor Ben Kenobi, is with them all. Retreating from Vader's minions, Luke ends up, at first, on the Ice Planet Hoth, and then the tropical Dagobah. Here he makes the acquaintance of the gnomish Yoda, whose all- encompassing wisdom comes in handy during the serial-like perils of the rest of the film. Before the film's open-ended climax, we are introduced to the apparently duplicitous Lando Calrissian and are let in on a secret that profoundly affects both Luke and his arch-enemy, Vader.Dark, sinister, but ultimately even more involving than A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back defies viewer expectations and takes the series to heightened emotional levels.A more mature installment than its predecessor,it is loaded with spectacular special effects and efficiently written, this may well be the pinnacle of the saga.It is very strong, cutting back and forth between Luke training with Yoda and Han, Leia, Chewie and C-3P0 fighting the Empire. And it's paced leisurely enough that you get to know the characters a little bit.Aside from that,it is visually more exciting, more artful and meticulous in detail.Obviously,it is a worthy sequel to Star Wars, equal in both technical mastery and characterization which makes it the best Star Wars film."
22895,True,"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back has to be easily one of my favorite movies of all time. The movie has a strong cast, a great director, and a really awesome sound track. This movie is the second one in a three part trilogy that revolves around a group of heroes and how they help save the galaxy from the tyranny of the Empire. The main characters are Luke Skywalker (Played by Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Played by Harrison Ford), and Princess Leia (Played by Carrie Fisher). George Lucas, the director and maker of Star Wars, does a fantastic job telling the story about Luke and his friends and the challenges they face. And John Williams wrote the music that, which in my opinion, helps make the movie a true epic."
22896,True,"The Empire Strikes Back is the first sequel to Star Wars (1977), a thrilling and lively action/adventure movie, but Empire is actually a different kind of movie. It's darker, more thoughtful and slower. There's less action.At the end of the first one, which is confusingly called Episode IV, Luke had joined the rebellion against the evil Galactic Empire and had destroyed its most powerful weapon, the Death Star. With Empire (aka Episode V), the imperial forces pursue the rebels through space, and Luke travels to a swampy world to learn from a Jedi master named Yoda. He receives visions from the future that his friends will get into trouble, and leaves his training, against the advice of Yoda and the ghost of Obi Wan, to rescue them. Luke confronts Darth Vader, who informs him that he is Luke's father.For a movie about a war, this is pretty low on violence, with little action happening between the fight on the ice world and the climax where Luke faces Vader. That's because The Empire Strikes Back tries to be a different kind of movie. It is not so much light entertainment. It instead features thoughts on the Force, in scenes where Yoda instructs Luke, which basically means a discussion of the nature of good and evil. Evil is strong and tempting, and anger leads to it; but goodness is stronger. The Empire Strikes Back is thus a heavier work, though it's not exactly high art. Still, one should not get the wrong impression from the AFI lists counting Episode IV but not Episode V as one of the 100 greatest American movies. Episode V is as good (or better!)- much of it, including Yoda who is not in Episode IV, is iconic. By the way, Yoda is, from a special effects point of view, passable puppetry.What else can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? It's got a score that has become legendary in its own right. The plot twist of Vader being Luke's father is also famous and weighty. Altogether, an effective portrait of the struggle between good and evil."
22897,True,"I love this film, I think it is mainly because of the sexual tension Leia and Han have which started in the first film and spilled over into this one. I love their relationship where they argue and you can see they care for one another but they won't tell the other and it is like a battle of wills between two strong people who won't admit they have deep feelings for one another. There are some tender scenes especially when Han is put into carbon freeze and Leia finally admits to Han that she loves him.In this film, Luke has developed from the first one, he has changed from the boy who was protected by his family and not allowed to help fight in the war with the empire. Now, he has had adventures and learnt about his powers and is starting to master them with the help of Yoda. I find it hard to understand Yoda at times because he adds a lot of ""am I"" at the end of his sentences and can be very annoying.Lucas also allows the audience to see another side of Vader where we see that he is not all machine that he once was a person.This film is interesting because it ends on a cliffhanger and I didn't know that the reason for this was they didn't know if Harrison Ford was coming back as Han. I just thought Lucas had written it that way so we are left to wonder what will happen in the next one and if Harrison Ford will be back for the last film. The film also ends on a shocking note because Luke finds out that Vader is his father. In the first film, Obi-wan told him his father was destroyed by Vader and the audience is left to wonder what will happen in the next film, if Luke with have to kill his father."
22898,True,"Is it possible that this is even better than Star Wars: Episode IV? This chapter of the Star Wars saga is unique in that it is neither directed, nor written by Luca$. Irvin Kershner directs and Leigh Brackett & Lawrence Kasdan are the credited writers of this screenplay. I consider that is why it is widely thought of as the best of the OT: Luca$ neither directed, nor wrote it. This is perhaps one of the most successful sequels of all time. While it rates an 8.7/10 at the Internet Movie Database, and IV rated an 8.8/10, there is a large school of thought whereby the idea is expressed that this installment of the Luca$ Money Machine is superior to the original. I must say that I subscribe to this notion. The story featured is darker, while maintaining the same charm and enjoyability as Episode IV. There is less action and more story, and that is fine by me. I was as enchanted by the plot as I was roused by the action. There are no obvious plot holes (at least, not yet. Episode III has not yet been released); no contrivances. Everything fits nicely into its place and feels properly nestled within. There has been much speculation as to the meaning of Yoda's words to Obi-Wan concerning ""the other."" ""That boy is our last hope."" Obi-Wan ""No. There is another."" Yoda Most casual fans of this franchise, affectionately known as the Luca$ $tar War$ $aga or the Luca$ Money Machine, tend to believe that Yoda refers to Leia in that statement, and indeed, Obi-Wan does confirm that it was Leia about whom Yoda spoke. But I have always had another thought about that. Since there are further Star Wars stories, not to mention countless novels produced in the genre of ""fan fiction,"" and an enormous Expanded Universe, I am a bit timid to discuss my feelings here, but will force myself to expound upon my thoughts as a means of catharsis, if for no other reason. I believe Yoda referred to Han Solo. I have two reasons. There are more, to be sure, but I will detail only two; the most poignant, in my opinion. First, to activate the light saber, one must possess the proper mindset; that of a Jedi. Whether it is because of metichlorine-filled blood, a state of heart, or a Gods-given gift, that ability belongs to a Jedi alone. Joe-Blow from down the road couldn't activate a light saber. But Han did, in this Episode, when cutting open the Ton-Ton to save Captain Solo's life in the frozen wastelands of Hoth.Second. Han Solo has the ability to navigate a rather large freighter through an asteroid belt, with the controls set to ""manual."" This type of ability was demonstrated in Episode IV to effectively demonstrate Luke's growing abilities as a Jedi.Han and Leia's relationship deepens, Chewy has a few pivotal scenes (his part is much more vocal and present in this chapter), and our favorite Droids are given the full star treatment. As I mentioned earlier, the theme here is much darker than was Episode IV. Lord Vader's copious presence goes a long way towards furthering that goal, as does the lighting, tone and mood of the musical score. The stormtroopers somehow seem more menacing, and Carrie Fisher's performance abilities seem to have doubled from her first Star Wars attempt. Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker finally earns that battle scene with Vader which was promised in the first installment (or fourth, whatever), and we see the return of Obi-Wan (kind of).It is amusing to see Yoda play the part of a troublesome creature while testing Skywalker's demeanor and potential. Once he makes his determinations surrounding Skywlaker's training, his changes in tone and behavior back to that of the Jedi Master he is, were obvious. It was quite endearing to see him that way: Apparently made feral by the wild swampy jungle in which he dwells. And then to discover it was all just an act. Beautifully done. While this chapter appears at first viewing to depend completely upon the fourth and sixth Episodes for support, Episode V does have a noticeable beginning, climax, and ending. The elements of that beginning, climax, and ending; however, do depend upon those other Episodes to explain it and uplift it. You must subscribe to the mindset of the fourth chapter in order to comprehend the subtle meanings of what takes place. Without knowledge of Episode IV, this is just another popcorn movie. An incredibly done popcorn movie, but a popcorn movie, nonetheless. But with that knowledge, this movie is instantly elevated to that of the ""Superior Sequel"" in that the story is far richer, the execution feels much more natural, and the conclusion is an excellent cliffhanger even though there is an obvious end.While it is superior, it lacks the level of newness the original possessed. It receives a well-earned 9.8/10 from... the Fiend :."
22899,True,"Arguably the best of the Star Wars trilogy, Empire Strikes Back continues the trend of Star Wars: A New Hope with more of the same hit specials and story.  Without wanting to give away spoilers, this film simply has all the twists and turns one would never expect. However, make SURE you have seen the original before you get to Empire Strikes Back, or you won't have any clue as to whats going on."
22900,True,"(spoilers ahead) Even if you don't like war movies with violence, don't miss this film. It deserves to be in the top 10 films of all time in my opinion. Unlike most Star Wars films, this one doesn't all focus on shooting and killing. Much of it is centered on Luke training to be a Jedi and Han and Leia's romance.One of the first scenes in the movie is the best war scene that'll probably ever be made. The empire deploys ""Imperial Walkers"" to lumber slowly towards the Rebel base to destroy the shield generator so that the Imperial fleet can invade the Rebel base. Luke and company try to bring down the walkers in ""snowspeeders"", in one of the most enjoyable battle scenes to watch in the trilogy.The scene directly after that one is probably one of the best as well. Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and C-3P0 are attempting to escape from the Rebel base in the Falcon, but run into two problems: the Falcon's hyperdrive is damaged, making it impossible to go into lightspeed. Secondly, the Imperial fleet is right on top of them. In a brilliantly-thought-of scene, Han escapes the TIE fighters in an asteroid field and finds ""shelter"" in a big asteroid.Those two scenes alone make this movie one of the best made ever. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher return from the original film to play their parts even better (Ford had a dramatic improvement from the first one) and Billy Dee Williams played well as Lando Calrissian.
A must see for anybody, even those who weren't huge fans of the series. My highest recommendations: ***** out of *****"
22901,True,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Whenever my friends and I discuss Star Wars, I always say that Empire Strikes Back is the best of them.  Why?  Because it added not only emotion and conflict into the series, it asserted that the Empire and Dark Side of the force have tremendous power despite the Death Star getting blown up. It also made the Empire seem as hated as ever.  No one could have ever expected that Darth Vader was Luke's father, and the big question mark left at the end of the movie made everyone want to come back for more."
22902,True,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" is brilliant. Never has a sequel so elaborately outbeaten an original in quality! I rank this one up there with the greatest films of all time. Original version: 10/10. Special Edition: 10/10. I shall never forget this one.Of the original trilogy, I think this one was the best. Of the Special Editions, I now think ""Star Wars"" is the best. This is only because it was such as elaborate update. I truly think Lucas wanted to outdo this one, because Irvin Kershner had made the better film. Lucas succeeded. He didn't need to do much to ""Empire"", though. This is such a complete film, with such a complete feel to it. However, I did love the update!It's hard to describe this one. It is a dark, melodramatic fantasy told in the most detailed way. This has not got the all-round enveloping feeling that the original film has. It has a feeling that the world it is bringing us back to is a more convincing one. One that tells us it is possible more than it could be possible. It has all the elements of the original, but has a more mature, adult level.I think I can honestly say that there is more subtext in the ""Star Wars"" movies than any others. It is not a cunning and biting satire or an overly offensive rip-off. It is basically a general feeling that there is more to the story than what is seen and heard. You can snese it in your nerves. Of all the ""Star Wars"" movies, I think ""Empire"" realises it the best.I would not dream of spoiling this movie, nor to any movie. I like to think I just praise them and encourage people to see them. Just let me tell you one thing(POSSIBLE SPOILER): Don't expect a happy ending!""The Empire Strikes Back"" is an imaginative, intelligent masterpiece. Entertaining and enlightening. The scariest and yet the best of the ""Star Wars"" movies. Not your classic fairy-tale. I guess that's what I liked about it!"
22903,False,"`It avoids having the standard shoot-'em-up ending,' says a friend of mine, `by not having an ending.'  I suppose this is what most people think, but all the same the film manages to form a satisfying whole; or at least, a whole that satisfies me.  I'm therefore inclined to think it DOES have an ending.  Obviously, I can't discuss this without giving things away to those few who don't know what happens.  If you're one of those few, then believe me: your ignorance is precious enough to be worth guarding until you see the film.  Stop reading now.After the surprise attack on the rebel base, Luke Skywalker splits with Han, Leia, et al.  Han's party gets away first (is it just me, or is the shot of Luke watching the Falcon flying off while he stands stranded on the ground, a poignant one?), but thereafter they face one narrow escape after another, while Luke slinks off quietly and safely to train with Yoda.The training scenes are many and Yoda talks a great deal of rubbish.  But somehow it doesn't matter.  The film is ambivalent in its attitude towards Yoda, anyway.  Our sympathy clearly lies with the entirely non-spiritual concerns of Han, Leia and the adolescent Luke.  The main story concerns the understanding that builds between Han and Leia.  In the end they are honest with one another; and if Han's being frozen and shipped back to Tatooine is the price to pay for this, well, it's the price to pay.  It was very important NOT to end with the dashing rescue that opens `Return of the Jedi', which would be dramatically beside the point.  Instead we end with the promise that the rescue will some day occur.  That's enough.As for Luke: he abandons Yoda to rescue Han and Leia, and achieves NOTHING WHATEVER.  This was my favourite touch.  All five Jedis - Luke, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Vader, and the Emperor - find that their conflicting instincts are all entirely wrong.  The film is really about the temporary triumph of human impulses over the mystical Force.  Luke's human idealism is vindicated, but his supernatural powers, just this once, are not.When George Lucas gave his Star Wars trilogy a fresh coat of varnish in 1997 he felt he had to justify the expense by making needless changes.  You'll notice he made precious few changes to episode V.  There just wasn't room. He added a few extra shots of the ice monster, which of course weakened that one scene; but even with those changes in place the Special Edition is virtually identical to the original edition.  Since Lucas was so keen on making changes wherever he could this is obviously a tribute to the tightness of the story and the direction.  It's also a tribute to the perfection of the original special effects, more innovative than the effects in the first Star Wars movie and better than the effects in any subsequent one."
22904,False,"In a film like The Empire Strikes Back, especially a few years on the heels of such a mind-bogglingly great film like the original Star Wars, there is something that comes immediately to mind that would at first seem to count against the film, but instead only winds up increasing the respect that it commands. In the 1977 Star Wars, there is a clear reliance on simplicity in some parts. Obviously, it is much more than a simply made science fiction film, but like I said in my review of it, there was a lot of highly effective reliance on things that were not put on screen, such as Obi Wan's description of The Force to Luke. In The Empire Strike Back, the first thing that we are treated to is the traditional scrolling text along a background of stars, depicting what has happened between the last film and this one, and reminding us of the things that were mentioned in the last film but never explained.At first, this would almost seem to be a way to save money to get more information across to the audience without having to actually put it on screen, but this is really an ingenious way of furthering the story. The very fact that we are so willing to read all this information and forgive our inability to actually see it is a testament to the quality of the series, even at this early stage in its presentation, and we know the story so well from the first film that we are glad to see such a large change in what's happening in the films, not for a second lamenting the fact that we have obviously missed so much action. And besides that, if and when George Lucas runs out of new prequels to release, and maybe if he someday begins to run low on how many hundreds of millions of dollars he has, he could go right back and make these in-between scenes into full length films. What would he call these, if he did that? Introquels? Who cares! The names themselves would be interesting enough, and if you go back and read the stuff that introduces this film, it's obvious that there's an entire film there just waiting to be made. I guess the question of actors would be a formidable one, though.The Empire Strikes Back is the film where we are first introduced to the great Jedi master Yoda (`Away put your weapon!'), as well as some of the most thrilling battle sequences of the entire Star Wars series, and that includes the prequels. The battle scene where the rebels fight the Imperial Walkers on the ice planet is an incredibly well-made battle scene, not only in the way that it was put together so convincingly using models, but that the machines themselves are so creatively made. Indeed, the Imperial Walkers are some of the most recognizable machines from the entire Star Wars saga, right up there with the Millennium Falcon and the Death Star.
I have just watched this film again, having already seen Episode I and Episode II, and not having seen any of the original Star Wars films for maybe 10 years (except for the original 1977 Star Wars, which I saw and reviewed a few days ago - and these aren't even the Special Edition versions!). When I first saw Yoda when watching The Empire Strikes Back again, I was really struck by how different he looked from in the newer movies. Obviously, he's completely computer generated in the new films, but here in Episode V he looks like a muppet! Even so, I would like to express my opinion that Yoda is more realistic and more interesting here as a puppet than in the newer films as a computer generated image. At least here in the older films you know that he's actually THERE, and that he's not just added into the film later.Oh yeah, speaking of Yoda, can I just complain for a minute? What the hell was up with the Jedi training? Yes, I realize that I'm just a lowly IMDb reviewer, while The Empire Strikes Back is a part of the greatest science fiction series of all time, but would it have killed George Lucas to write in a little more creative training for Luke? The thing that struck me first about the Star Wars films when I first started watching them was how incredibly imaginative they were, but then Luke started his training. You know, when I was in high school I played football. I was a wide receiver/tight end and I hardly ever got to play because I was too tall and too skinny, but part of my workout was to carry the linemen up and down the stairs to the weight room. Some of these guys weighed 100 pounds more than me, and I still almost never saw the field, and here's Luke Skywalker. He carries Yoda around this boggy swamp and he gets to be a Jedi! What the hell!There is also the addition of a surprisingly fitting love story. First of all, anyone who has ever read my review of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie will know that I am not the biggest fan of cramming a love story into a movie where it doesn't belong. I can't seem to write anything about Bruckheimer movies without complaining about the idiot love story, and now it's even worse because here's this movie that was made so long before, from which Bruckheimer could obviously have at least learned a LITTLE bit about how to do it right. Han Solo and Princess Leia maintain the personalities that they developed in the first Star Wars film and there is now a sort of love/hate relationship between the two of them, where neither one of them wants to admit their feelings for the other. This romantic subplot is characterized perfectly in the scene just before Solo is carbon frozen, when Leia risks approaching a cheesy romantic moment by saying `I love you' just before Han is lowered into the freezing chamber, and he saves the moment by responding, `I know.' Han Solo. Smart-ass to the last drop.Before I end I would like to point out that the goofs that can be found on the IMDb for this film are some of the most blatant that I've ever seen in a film. The scene where you can see someone giving a woman at the tactical maps a cue to deliver her lines is amazingly obvious, and some of the other ones, such as the stage hand swinging the light saber prop briefly into view as he switches it for an `off' prop with Luke just after he knocks Darth Vader over backwards, are just as much fun to look for. I have one question about the goofs, though. There's one where Luke looks off into the fog just after R2-D2 is eaten by the sea monster, and you can CLEARLY see a person running to the right a little ways off in the fog. Is that meant to be Luke? It seems that it's supposed to be him running in his search for R2, because you can even hear the FOOTSTEPS of the person running. I can't even IMAGINE how they could have missed THAT!!It is, however, a testament to the quality of a film when such tremendous oversights in editing do nothing to take away from the overall quality of the film. The Empire Strikes Back remains an extremely powerful and well-made installment in the Star Wars series, not taking even a single step backwards in the sheer breathtaking adventure of the original film. It's not often that a film as good as Star Wars can be released and then followed up with a sequel that is just as great, as is clearly the case here. Star Wars was a gigantic film upon its release, and with The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas has begun the formation of one of the greatest film series' in cinematic history."
22905,False,"An excellent sequel to Star Wars, this is easily the darkest and most serious out of all the Star Wars films, at least until Revenge of the Sith comes out. This movie benefits from the introduction of Yoda, a diminutive yet wise Jedi master who helps Luke prepare for his showdown with Darth Vader. It also introduces Lando Calrissian, Han's old gambling and smuggling buddy played very well by Billy Dee Williams. Empire is more character driven than the original and relies more on comic relief to help lighten the mood, but it doesn't go overboard with the humor. The story is more refined and the acting is better as well. Despite all of this I can't really say that I enjoyed Empire more than the original. The original Star Wars has a certain charm to it that none of the sequels (or prequels) have captured. I'd say that it is at least on par with the original though and is a fitting follow up in what is probably the greatest series of movies in the history of cinema."
22906,False,"I cannot believe some people out there didn't like this film, yet claim to have enjoyed Episode One. No comparison whatsoever. ""The Empire Strike Back"" is George Lucas' best contribution to human history, and it will be remembered long after most other science fiction films have gone the way of the Do-Do Bird. The optical effects still stand the test of time, and the acting is superb. Harrison Ford, Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher are all better than they we in the original Star Wars, having fully developed and grown into their characters, and the story just keeps going and going, from asteroid fields to swamp planets to cities in the sky, everything in this film works. So ignore anyone who claims to dislike it, and see it for yourself if you haven't already done so. 20 out of 10!!Oh, and Han Solo shot first! =)"
22907,False,"The sequel to Star Wars is argueably the best of all the Star Wars films.This is much darker than the 1st one.Look for the Super Star Destroyer,it is a awesome ship.Boba Fett makes his fist appearence here.The chase scene the M.Falcon is being chased down by the Star Destroyers and Tie Fighters is really a cool scene.I f you like the 1st Star Wars then you will love this one!Note: The special edition has added scenes,special effects,sounds,and creatures. To ME the highlight of this special edition is seeing the Wampa monster!"
22908,False,"I literally watched this movie about twenty times when I first got it, VHS , a box-set of the original three. But this one is best! It was the most exciting, it kept you on the edge of your seat and your mind the whole way through. Although, I have to say, Lucas has become very lazy in the Star Wars saga since the Phantom Menace, which was quite poor. This is vintage Lucas and this your vintage space movie. Star Wars (any of the original 3 and Episode 3) is a must see! It includes many household names. Some, though, hate Star Wars with a vengeance. Those people lack in creativity and are subject to boring, lack-luster films. All I can say is have fun because I know you won't for missing out on this 5-star, one of a kind classic. Must see, it's too great for a 10 out of 10 rating. It was way ahead of its time. It's a film of the ages and has caliber modern films dream to re-create!"
22909,False,"Congratulations have to go to line producer Gary Kurtz and director Irvin Kershner in pushing the production to out-perform A New Hope, even though the consequence was a film that came in massively over budget, and almost cost Lucas his hard fought independence from the Hollywood system.The plot moves quickly, from an interesting script by Leigh Bracket and Larry Kasdan, focusing on exploring two key relationships. The first is the relationship between Han Solo and Leia Organa, which is touched upon in a New Hope, but is fleshed out more in this film. The other is the more central relationship between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. This relationship is also linked in to the main supporting character in this film, Yoda, who is fantastically well realised by the film crew and performed brilliantly by Frank Oz. There are other characters, but whereas C3P0 and R2D2 were a central part of the story in the previous film, they are more on the sidelines.What makes this film so great though is the involving and effective way the relationships operate within the broader story. The banter between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher is highly effective and amusing, operating through the classical love-hate relationship. One senses that Kershner, as a director of character driven films, worked very effectively with the actors and gave them the space to develop their characters which meant plenty of choices for the director in terms of their performances. The same goes for Mark Hamill's interaction with Yoda(Frank Oz). This is totally convincing and builds up the confrontation with Darth Vader very well. It was time well spent in getting these performances right. Kershner is very good at keeping the performance naturalistic, but reduces the level of broadness in the characters, making them more complex and interesting. Darth Vader benefits from this with scenes in the film that add to the mystique of the character. The confrontation with Luke Skywalker is riveting and dramatic and elevates the film above the level of its predecessor. Technically the film is even more impressive than its predecessor. Credit has to go the Oscar nominated Art Direction team. John Barry, who had worked on the previous film, passed away during the production, but Norman Reynolds led the team superbly, with the excellent creations of Dagobah and Hoth, albeit Bespin in the original does feel a bit like a set, and the digital embellishments in the special edition were helpful in creating a bigger feel to those scenes. However, I was disappointed in the reworked scene with Palpatine in the special edition - while putting the excellent Ian McDiarmid was supporting continuity, to show him face on was, in my view an error and the reworked scene would have played much better with his face shrouded, or at the least partially obscured. The whole point of the scene was that the dialogue as strong enough without the need to ram an unsubtle visual at the audience. Editing is excellent, led by Star Wars veteran Paul Hirsch, but it is known that both George Lucas, and his then wife Marcia were also heavily involved in putting the film together. Peter Suschitzky's photography is more conventional and low key in approach than A New Hope, but is particularly effective on the Dagobah scenes in Elstree Studios, and the location scenes in Norway. ILM's visual effects were outstanding, and rightly won an Academy Award. The crew consisted of the following: Oscar winning A New Hope veteran Richard Edlund, working with British effects supervisor Brian Johnson (who had just won an Oscar for Alien), effects photographer Dennis Muren (who would become an award winning and digital effects pioneer for ILM for ET, Return of the Jedi, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Innerspace, The Abyss, T2 and Jurassic Park) and compositor Bruce Nicholson, who would go on to win an Oscar for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, and work on a wide variety of films in Hollywood. George Lucas took a strong interest and influence in the special effects and also has to take credit for some of the excellent sequences in the film, which also work because they help drive the story along. Again, like a New Hope, sound work was first rate and Oscar winning. In most cases the sound has to be recorded in a studio and added many months after filming has been completed. Sound re-recordist Bill Varney would win another Oscar for Raiders of the Lost Ark. Steve Maslow and Gregg Landaker also worked as sound-recordists and are both prolific contributors to many high profile movies. They would also win Oscars for their work on Raiders and then some fourteen years later win again for their work on the Keanu Reeves hit movie Speed. Peter Sutton won for his onset work and has a large body of work in film since this movie. Also credit has to go the Ben Burtt's sound design work, which creates a fabulous sound-scape for the film.However, despite the above outstanding technical contributions, which serve to enhance and exciting and interesting story, it is composer John Williams who, yet again, takes this film to another level with another astounding musical score. Working with the director and producers, Williams develops and expands original themes. He creates a new and unforgettable theme for Darth Vader, with strong militaristic overtones, and clever themes for Leia and Han, and for Yoda. He weaves the score into the film expertly, giving moments of tension, excitement, thoughtfulness, mystery and tragedy with aplomb. The score feels more operatic than a New Hope, and helps cement this as one of the best adventure/fantasy films ever made. Congratulations to Mr Lucas for delivering a remarkable sequel, but also to Gary Kurtz and Irvin Kershner for having the courage to push everyone out of their comfort zones so as to reach this level of excellence."

During the investigation of a meteor crash, Luke is wounded and captured by a creature but succeeds to escape. While dying on the snow, he has a vision of Obi-Wan Kenobi telling him to go to the Dagobah system to be trained by the Jedi Master Yoda. Later he is saved by Han and they are rescued in the morning by the rebels. Meanwhile Darth Vader (David Prowse) sends probe droids through the galaxy to find the location of the base.

""The Empire Strikes Back"", later retitled ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" is a fantastic sequel of Star Wars, with a great story. The plot has adventure, romance, comedy and betrayal and is engaging until the very end. The characters now are more experienced and bonded. The mannerisms of C-3PO recalls Dr. Smith, from ""Lost in Space"". This is the type of sequel that keeps the high quality of the original film. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""O Império Contra-Ataca"" (""The Empire Strikes Back"")"
22912,False,"Although called ""Episode V,"" this was second movie in the Star Wars 6-part installment and I've always thought one of the better entries in the series.If you watch the first Star Wars and then this one, you'll immediately see a vast improvement in the special-effects department. There is a much more polished look to this one, and improved sound In fact, the DVD transfer is outstanding considering the age of this film.While the first Star Wars was a bit subdued, this one picks up the action right from the start, although lulls are really appreciated because the first 40 minutes are pretty hectic. The most notable of those scenes are the gigantic robots which were awesome when this film first came out, and are still pretty good. The movie calms down after that opening land war but retains the viewer's interest with other things.The second half of the movie features two stories going on at once: the battle in space with most of the cast involved, and ""Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in a swampland involved in his training sessions with the Master Yoda.Some of the movie's dialog is still corny, especially between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) with their love-hate relationship, but it's not overdone. What is overdone is constant bleating noises emanating from ""Chewbacca,"" the wookie. That sheep-in-heat noise can get annoying after awhile. The ""Rambo"" action continues as it did in the first film, with the villains firing everything at our heroes and never hitting them. Ludicrous, but part of the deal. Those things you just put up with as the film, overall, delivers another interesting adventure, far more than the first Star Wars and leading up to the next one, which was even better."
22913,False,"The second installment of the original Star Wars trilogy benefits from coming from a time when there were very few films that could be called that. If it was made and released now it would be lost in a sea of big budget battles of good and evil aimed at making big money for a week or two and then disappearing.Thankfully it's from a time when it became one of the biggest films of the year or even the decade and it went on to inspire what the film industry is today. Without Star Wars and its army of nerds leading the way, there is no Marvel attempt to take over films and no comic-con and you would be looking at a very different world.This film has great moment and legendary quotes or misquotes and of course it has its flaws but what blockbuster doesn't and in the end it is a Star Wars film so it's worth watching.Featured on Episode 69 of The Emerald Reprobates Podcast."
22914,False,"This film is the continuation of the story of the first. The war between the rebels and the Empire continues, while Darth Vader Luke demand throughout the galaxy. Directed by Irvin Kershner and written by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan, this film has the participation of the same actors from the first film.The film inherits most of the qualities of his predecessor. It has a carefully chosen cast and consistent performances, with some emphasis on the work of Harrison Ford, actor who was already highlighted in the first film and now consolidates his success. Action scenes are excellent, thought of meticulous way and the fight scenes with lightsaber remind us some great duels of piracy and swashbuckling films. The special visual and sound effects are the best that existed at the time and fulfill their role with great merit. The only difference between this film and the latest films of the saga is, in fact, this technical issue, given the huge advance that, in a few decades, the techniques and special effects achieved. The soundtrack was again in charge of John Williams, which continues the excellent work started in the first film of the saga. In fact, the first main theme of the chords of the saga became one of the songs that instinctively comes to mind of people when they think of film music, the same way as the ""March of Darth Vader"" has become one of most songs instinctively associated with the image of any movie villain. The point of greatest merit of this movie is the script. It is a deeper script, more psychological and intense than the script of the first film, and this contributed decisively to the success of it, and the franchise itself. Oscar winner for Best Sound, is one of the most popular films of the saga in the present day."
22915,False,"I really loved all star wars movies. I must say that music is excellent and that Dart wader theme is just great. The Cloud City, the most awesome of any of the Star Wars arenas, is a beautiful exterior with a dark heart. The film culminates in a whirl of emotional intensity and the infernal machine of the carbon freezing chamber. With John Williams' breathtaking score and the dark red hellish lighting, the whole feel is of a Wagnerian opera: dark and epic.Magnificently visualized, the dizzying vertiginous terror of the moment encapsulating Luke's disorientation and horror at Vader's revelation of paternalism."
22916,False,"The first Star Wars movie, is a Sci-fi and cinematic masterpiece. But where Star Wars capitalized, Empire Strikes Back took it to the next level.Here's what I think of the movie: Story - I'm pretty sure we all know the story of Star Wars. A Galactic Empire is empowering the galaxy, and a Rebel Alliance tries to stop it. Today, it's sort of a cliché plot but back then, it was imagination skyrocketing into the heavens. Now, thats the plot of Star Wars. The story spans from a battle on the frigid planet of Hoth, to a space dogfight in an asteroid field, to Cloud City where the greatest plot twist in the history of cinema, is reveled. The film ends on a cliffhanger which leads to Return of the Jedi. I'm not going to spoil it, but I don't think I would need to because I'm willing to bet that about 99.99% of people have already seen this movie anyway(to that .01%, where the hell have you been?).-Rating 10/10 Characters - The characters from the original movie are back, including Luke, Han, Leia, C3P0 and R2D2, and of course, Darth Vader. But the films also introduces some new characters as well, including Lando, The Emperor, Boba Fett, and Yoda. The Emperor doesn't really play a big part in the movie(I think he only has like, 10 lines) and Boba's name is never really mentioned. However, Yoda plays a big part by teaching Luke the ways of the force, and Lando, who is Han's old pal, plays a big part by betraying our heroes and giving them to Vader. Of course, he's still a good guy, he had to hand them over. Overall, I'd say the characters are still great.Rating 10/10 Visuals - This was back when Star Wars movies didn't rape the fabric of CGI. So what you see in the movie were real things. The Walkers, asteroids, X-Wings, Tie Fighters, everything. The original Star Wars set the standards for Special Effects with the light sabers, Death Stars blowing up and everything. Empire Strikes Back isn't any different. The Effects are still awesome and look great.-Rating 10/10Music - The Star Wars theme is (of course) still here and it's one of the most recognized themes in cinema. You only need to hear a second of the Star Wars theme, and you'll know what it is. Like any other Star Wars film, the music is composed by John Williams, so everything is played by an orchestra. Even though it's great the here the Star Wars theme in all it's nostalgic glory, the music thats played is still just as great.-Rating 10/10 Overall - Empire Strikes back is my favorite Star Wars film and is one of my favorite movies. If I had to make a Top 10 list of my favorite movies, about 15 movies would be tied for the #1 spot, and this would be one of them. Everything about it is just perfect.Final rating : 10/10 -PeterPPK"
22917,False,"Star wars is a Saturday morning breakfast serial, with the upbeat 'let's have an Olympic medal ceremony' ending...Empire discards the fluffiness and moves away from its simplistic predecessor's obvious appeal to the child fanbase, without scaring everybody away in the process. The 2nd Star Wars film takes the original cast and subjects them to 2 hours of major discomfort...A forbidding icy planet replete with nasty creatures. There are ugly bounty hunters, monsters hiding out in the depths of asteroid fields, and Luke's foray into the black swamp of the Degobah system. It's a more taut, curiously downbeat film that slows almost to a halt in places, as Luke meets the Jedi Master who will teach him the ways of the force. The set pieces more than make up for the lack of pace...The opening battle on the Ice planet is a visually effective affair, and the stormtroopers have never looked as cool when they don their winter outfits. The asteroid chase and cloud city sequence are visual treats, that take you into the mysterious heart of the Star Wars Universe. The character development glues everything together. Luke's maturing process in the darkness of Degobah..Han and Leia's romantic chemistry, the droids comic relief and interplay with Chewbacca solidifies the group together and establishes a team spirit that was coming together at the end of Episode IV. The centrepiece of the film is the epic showdown between Luke and Vader,with that massive revelation, which inevitably ranks as one of Cinema's all time memorable moments. And it's a great sequence, from Vader's sobering welcome 'The force is with you young Skywalker, but you are not a Jedi yet' to the almost surreal climax. The forces of darkness loom large at every turn of the film...you get the feeling that the rebels are just slightly out of their depth. There is an underlying menace at work that heightens the dramatic tension..Vader is never as beautifully evil as he is in Empire. We finally see just why he is (Emperor aside) the top dog in the galaxy, as he lays waste to his own generals in ruthless fashion. We get some great new characters...Han's old buddy Lando Calrissien (sp?) is the slimy administrator of cloud city, who finds himself in a no-win situation, and there's the legendary Boba Fett..bounty hunter with balls of steel, and an outfit so cool it instantly establishes him as a Star Wars icon. And of course, the emperor rears his ugly head, and we get a taster of his malevolance. Any faults? It's hard to find much complaint. Some of the dialogue strays into cheeseland, the pace is interrupted with the curious but necessary Degobah scenes, but all in all, the sum of the parts adds up to a supremely effective, tightly woven sci-fi drama, the most deliciously dark of all Star Wars movies, and the most mature. Classic entertainment, stuck in a time capsule of its own, with enough memorable moments to ensure its place in the higher echelons of cinema history."
22918,False,"Call me blasphemous, but cinematically, The Empire Strikes back is far superior to the original Star Wars. We pick up shortly after the destruction of the Death Star. The Empire has dispatched probe droids to find the rebels. One probot finds a base on the remote world of Hoth. Frustrated, the rebels must bug out. Commander Luke Skywalker and his flight team make their stand against giant AT-AT Walkers and Imperial Snow Stormtroopers. Meanwhile, Leia cannot get to her transport, so Han Solo must get her out on the Millennium Falcon. Darth Vader is obsessed with finding Skywalker so he wants the Falcon. He will stop at nothing--even asteroids. Vader tracks them to Bespin where Han hopes an old friend, Lando can help out. However, Vader beat them there and force Lando to turn them over. Luke ventures to Dagobah to meet Yoda, the Jedi Master. There he undergoes training to be a Jedi. As he learns to focus the Force, he has a vision of Han and Leia suffering in a city in the clouds. He leaves training prematurely to face Vader. He is not ready. And he learns of Vader's secret. Star Wars was an introduction and The Empire Strikes Back goes deeper. At the outset, we learn more about the Force and how it can help. It was only vaguely touched on in the first one. We also learn more of Vader's sinister side. In the first one, his presence and appearance exuded evil. In this one, he demonstrates it through dispatching the Empire officers who fail him. We also get to see Leia and Han grow closer. Their love blossoms and grows. They had real chemistry. Finally, Luke really grows. He is the impatient, naive, and adventurous boy. He suffers for his decision. This forces him to mature. While some people found Chewabaca's incessant howling over the fate of Han Solo, I found it touching, giving the great side-kick alien depth and soul. The magic of Star Wars is unmeasurable. It was great swashbuckling fun with age old themes of good triumphing over evil. It allowed us to escape and be struck with wonder and awe. Empire, though, is thoughtful, deep, analytical, and fun. The audience will identify with Luke, Han, Leia and Chewie all the more because of their suffering. At this point, they were no longer larger than life, but human. I compare this to falling in love. With Star Wars, the infatuation and lust begins. With Empire, the love deepens and becomes solid. If it never happened, the love would not mature. This is Lucas truly at his best. I hope he recaptures this someday."
22919,False,"Many feel The Empire Strikes Back is even better than Star Wars. Is this true? I really don't know, as Star Wars is probably the greatest film ever made, but many say ESB is as well.In many ways, Empire does surpass Star Wars as we get to know the characters even better and see their further adventures unfold. And the special effects - incredible. Much better than today's computer images. It is hard to believe scenes such as the Hoth Battle and the asteroid chase were filmed almost thirty years ago! Empire, if it is or isn't better than Star Wars, has to be one of the most perfect films ever made, to say the least. A timeless classic."
22920,False,"This, is one of those times where it's great when the bad guys win. I had grown up watching old westerns and kiddie movies, where it was all good guys win at the end. And when I first saw this when the Original (Best) Trilogy reopened in theaters, my parents rushed me to the nearest cinema. I was astounded. Great acting. Even better directing, it's the greatest space movie pretty much ever made.It's only better because ""Star Wars"" set this one up perfectly. And it allowed a suspenseful ""Return of the Jedi"", which needed all it could get, because it was the worst of the Original's, but still pretty darn good. Overall even though it was made in the 80's it was still captivating to a boy used to computer graphics. The absolute best part was the final lightsaber battle between Vader and Luke where... well, I won't spoil it for those who haven't heard the line."
22921,False,"After being abruptly evicted from his Death Star digs, Darth Vader seeks out the young rebel warrior responsible, Luke Skywalker. He has plans for the boy. Skywalker, meanwhile, leaves his friends in the middle of an Imperial invasion for a crash course in Jedi Knighthood amid a desolate swampworld with only a faultfinding green gnome for company. Can Luke complete his training before Darth reels him in?Well, no, actually. That's not the only way this middle installment of the ""Star Wars"" trilogy leaves things on a decidedly more discordant note than the previous, joyous ""Star Wars."" People call this the darkest of the original three films because it is, but ""Empire"" is the only one with an adult orientation. The characters are deepened, and our investment in them from the first film challenged by events that leave them exposed to the sort of cruelties we wrongly assumed them safe from.George Lucas deserves major praise for putting such a film together, using his well-earned profits from the first film. In essence, he was literally giving the fans back some dividends for their box office proceeds. He also took chances in terms of leaving them less happy this time, knowing the emotional payoff would have to come a film later.""Empire Strikes Back"" is thus a richer film than ""Star Wars"" emotionally, and in other ways, too. Instead of confining most of the action to the desert planet Tatoonie, the action bounces around from an ice planet to a swamp planet to the most marvelous creation of all, a city hovering high in the clouds of a gas giant, where the action culminates.Lucas adds some interesting new characters, particularly Yoda, the swamp creature Luke goes to for help, who articulates much of the philosophy and provides much of the fun in this film as voiced by Frank Oz, the guy behind (or under) Miss Piggy and later, a talented director in his own right.There's also Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian, the operator of Cloud City who provides much of the needed moral shading in the film as the stars from the previous movie are all full-blown heroes now. Williams has fun schmoozing up Leia and trying to find his feet as his slick machinations leave him in ever-hotter water.The best performance in this film is Mark Hamill's as Luke. Hamill had to work harder here than he did in ""Star Wars,"" sharing all his big scenes with a Muppet and a guy with a bucket on his head. But Hamill finds the essence of a character more interesting than the naive farmboy we saw in the first film, playing Luke as confused, fearful, impetuous, and flawed in a way that makes him more likable, rather than less so. How Hamill never hit it big after his great work here is an injustice on par with Cleavon Little's lack of work after ""Blazing Saddles.""What else about this is great? The score by John Williams, introducing the recognizable ""Imperial March"" theme music as well as some rousing material during the final confrontation between Luke and Darth. The interaction between Vader and his subordinates is chokingly funny, in a way that only adds to the suspense and dread. The opening battle around the ice planet is marvelously intense, especially as witnessed from the cockpits of Rebel fighters taking on thickly-armored Imperial walkers.The returning cast except for Hamill doesn't seem as sharp this time, especially Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia, so charming in ""Star Wars,"" gaunt and miserable here. Much of the whole middle section of the film is draggy and woolly, like the various silly ways the Millennium Falcon escapes Imperial pursuit and the scene in the ""cave"" that goes on much longer than it should. Even Luke's scenes with Yoda become slow and tedious with multiple viewings.The enthusiasm that makes ""Empire Strikes Back"" so beloved today is understandable. It turned ""Star Wars"" from a great film into an enjoyable franchise. But it doesn't really have the same stand-alone quality ""Star Wars"" has, needing both that earlier film and the later ""Return Of The Jedi"" to make it as great as it is."
22922,False,"Unexpectedly thought provoking, as adventurous as the first one - an immersive journey into the star wars universe -- escapism at its finest!It's a visually beautiful movie, the more I analysed it, the more surprised I was to find out how good the directing and cinematography this masterpiece of a movie has. When cinematography and directing wasn't in my vocabulary, I wasn't focusing on those aspects of movies, unconsciously, I, as a kid, was still mesmerized over how visually pleasing the movie's cinematography and directing was, without even being aware of it.Empire's score composed by John Williams: Williams has perfectly written the music for this movie, it's powerful when they show the empire's greatness with ''the imperial march'', it's mysterious in unclear, foggy locations. In my opinion, the only Star Wars score that surpasses Empire's score is Return of the Jedi's score.Not really any standout performances, but the actors and the writing gives the characters charm. We see the characters exchanging banter, and other well written interaction, developing the characters well, we also see them being a bit more developed since the previous installment.Practical effects' durability is shown here; it still holds up, it even looks better than most modern movies, and most of my favourite movies are even modern movies.It's the most well written Star Wars movie to-date, it's original and can't really be compared to many other movies. It's memorable, mysterious, shocking. Some may find the dialogue cheesy, some find it witty. It even brings a puppet to life, making him one of the best movie characters of all time. The universe expands from each scene, the universe feels grand. The movie's twists works, it's difficult to predict what will happen next.It's a journey like nothing else, fun from beginning to its end. Fast paced adventure, exploring the Star Wars universe. Highly recommended for audience of all sorts, the movie has it all for people with all kinds of taste in movies."
22923,False,"I always loved watching Star-wars and all kinds of Fantasy, Fiction and Sci-Fi genres TV-shows and Movies.Well, coming to Empire Strikes Back, it sure did gave me goosebumps while watching. cant ignore rest of the parts! they are much Awesome and most entertaining as always.Loved how the Plot twists and turns, always leaving Fans in suspense. Also, conflict between the brave but out-gunned Rebel Alliance and the mighty Galactic Empire Spices things up. it all comes back to the myth of the hero's destiny.""Star Wars will do very nicely for those lucky enough to be children or unlucky enough never to have grown up"" You all know what i mean. :)"
22924,False,"This film is incredible. I am so thankful for George Lucas and his boldness in writing it. I have watched quite a few documentaries on the Star Wars series and each documentary gives me more and more appreciation for the three films that came out in the 70's. Lucas took quite a risk with the Star Wars franchise and it (obviously) paid off for him. If you haven't, I would definitely suggest looking up some of these documentaries in order to see what the project was actually like when it was first made. The crew and cast describes it as a lot of chaos and self-doubt until its first debut when it gained its cult following. The way that Lucas wrote and directed these films is a tribute to his true genius and success."
22925,False,"The Empire Strikes Back is one of the few movies I call pitch perfect. Everything is flawless- the action? Edge of your seat! The drama? Heart-wrenching and powerful! The comedy? Frequently clever and hysterical! The special effects? Better than A New Hope, and then some! As for the 2004 DVD version, it still has the original flavor of the theatrical cut, the touches are few, and still has most shots from the original version. Also, may I add that all of the characters are perfectly developed and lovable, villain or hero. Han Solo is a great character in this, all because of his charming and awesome performance by Harrison Ford. My favorite character from Star Wars is Chewbacca, and there is no exception here. The stop motion animation done with the AT-ATs and the Taun-Tauns still are amazing today, and the wonders of the ship battles are just as beautiful. Overall, Empire is my favorite Star Wars, and one of my favorite movies. It has everything- heart, humor, action, drama, suspense. I highly recommend you see this one(if you haven't seen it already)."
22926,False,"The Empire Strikes back is the best of the original trilogy, as well as being the best of the entire series. Its so good that it is on my top ten films of all time. It manages to switch between the cheery space opera tone of the original film with added darkness and despair.The characters this time around are given much more screen time to grow and develop, being ever more three-dimensional. This depth of character is what adds to the first film and makes it so much better than the rest of the series. It shows the good and the evil, the greed and corruption and the tyranny that grows within the corners of the of the Star Wars universe.The cinematography, score and special effects remain quite consistent, moving on from those that were present in the first film. The only exception of this is the special effects, which have been slightly spruced up since the first film.The story itself has become a lot more brutal and unforgiving, without moving into spoilers, it fully embraces the dark side of the force and fully explores the darkest corners of its plot.It is because of the emotions stirred in Empire that the entire series takes on a mythic quality that resonates back to the first and ahead to the third.This is the heart of the franchise, this is the peak. Everything that has been added and built upon from the first film is fantastic, there are no conceivable downsides to this space epic.More Reviews at: http://12yearsacinephile.tumblr.com/"
22927,False,I remember to see this movie with my father(R.I.P)in theaters and in that time you don't know nothing about the movie is not like this times that you have magazinez and web to know everything about the movie so i was in 0 when i got to see it.Of course i see STAR WARS about 7 u 8 times and i was amazing when i see this movie i was open mouth..so dark so mysterius so thriller so tragic i mean everything in this movie was perfect.I can't believe that is almost 35 years of this movie and still looks great with new effects o not look's great!!!.That's why all the fans of SW knows that this is the best movie of the saga and simply one of the best sequels ever make in movie story!!!.
22928,False,"It took many years and many viewings before I could say that I liked this film better than A New Hope. But careful examination tells all - by every conceivable measure this is a better picture. The characters are more fully developed, Vader is even more evil, the score gives us the chilling Vader theme and the story is more interesting. Now that the six films are complete, The Empire Strikes Back is even more compelling and interesting than it was before we knew its Big Secret.All great heroes are flawed, and Luke Skywalker is no exception. Empire reveals to us in full that the inner battle he will have to fight is worse than any enemy he will face. As we meet for the first time Yoda, the wise Jedi master (we find out in Sith why he is on this jungle planet), we learn what a Jedi is, what his responsibility is and just how difficult that life will be. Luke, however, wants immediate gratification - he wants to help and wants revenge.The film cuts back and forth between Han Solo and Leia's pursuit by Vader and Luke's training and ultimately leads to the greatest scene of the six films, the epic light saber battle between Luke and Vader. And, if you are one of the 12 people on the planet who do not know the outcome, the less said the better.Empire rightly holds a place in the IMDb top 10, combining Action-Adventure, space opera and even the best elements of a super-hero film, into an infinitely watchable, entertaining movie. **** out of ****."
22929,False,"ESB is one of the best science fiction movies of all time. In most circles, there tend to be a division between 'regular' movies and science fiction ones, but the Empire Strikes Back not only wrote the importance of the previously establish Star Wars saga into history, but borough the Joneses and Kims and N'Danou's and Guptas and everyone else from all over the world a re-lived curiosity about a genre that often is exclusively reserved to geeks, gamers, and goblins. The first star wars movie was a feat in special effects and something quite new. The Empire Strikes back, however, drew us into a new world with an amazing conviction. We were all so very much standing next to Luke and Han, so that they have almost helped share their world with us, but also influence popular culture today in a somewhat surrealistic concept, where the actors/actresses step out of the TV/silver screen and dictate the 'real' world, using their 'fantasy' world to justify for their candor - in an almost 'emperor's new clothes' fashion. Only the greatest movies have the ability to enmesh reality and the fiction on the screen. Lord of the Rings did it, Hitchcock did it, and Lucas did it! Lucas made us believe in a world far away, long long time ago, which any other creator would have made seem like another Star Trek or Stargate episode (like the prequels)."
22930,False,"As great as the original Star Wars may be, The Empire Strikes Back remains the best film in the series. As the years pass, the real achievement of Empire only grows. While the original film has grown somewhat dated in appearance, and Return of the Jedi feels a bit silly now, Empire has maintained remarkable staying power. The effects in the film feel as fresh now as they did in 1980, and as importantly the story and tone of the film still hold an ominous feel and lend the series the grandeur that made it so lasting. Without Empire, Star Wars would have been remembered but not nearly in the same way. Everything that was begun in Star Wars was expanded and improved upon here, right down to the score Remember, this was the movie that introduced the now-famous and ridiculously overplayed Imperial March composed by John Williams. And virtually every scene is now iconic--the Imperial Walkers in the snow, Luke's training in the swamp, the asteroid field chase of the Millennium Falcon, the Cloud City, Luke's lightsaber battle with Vader. When I think of ""Star Wars"", most of the images that come to mind first are from Empire. The colors and textures of the film are so sharp and rich.A truly majestic film. One of the great visual statements in the history of movies, and one of the most successful realizations of a movie vision we will ever see."
22931,False,"It's very rare when a sequel outshines the film that came before it,""The Empire Strikes Back"" manages to do that in many ways. ""Star Wars"" always will be considered an all time classic,but ""Empire"" is a great follow up.According to George Lucas,It's ""Episode V"" in his space opera. In my opinion it's the best in the series.The characters are more fleshed out this time,and the plot is more complex and darker then the previous installment. The F/X is outstanding.The film stands on it's own as a great cinematic achievement and should be recognized as more than a sequel,It's a continuation of great epic and all around excellent film."
22932,False,"Back in the 80's, people were very excited for the release of The Empire Strikes Back, the much-awaited sequel to the phenomenal Star Wars. But, I can imagine, they were also wondering if it would be as good as Star Wars. No, it's not. It's much better. There's more action, the characters become richer and we are introduced to new ones. Thankfully, Lucas backed down in directing and/or writing the film. Considered as the best film among the Trilogy, The Empire Strikes Back starts with the whole gang staying at a Rebel base in the ice planet of Hoth. After almost getting mauled by a Wampa Beast, Luke gets a message from Obi-Wan Kenobi to go to the Planet of Dagobah and look for a Jedi Master named Yoda. The Imperial Army arrives and tries to destroy the base, but the Rebels have already escaped, with Luke accompanied by R2-D2 goes to Dagobah. The Battle of Hoth is easily my favorite action scene in the whole Trilogy.While Han, Leia and Chewbacca are hiding from the Imperial army that's chasing them, Luke meets the 800 year-old Jedi Master Yoda. Full of wisdom and a funny way of talking, Yoda trains Luke to be a real Jedi and teaches him the ways of a Jedi. Almost nothing happens in the middle of the film, except for great character development and lots of intelligent dialogue. It manages to keep us interested and excited without having too many action scenes. We get to know more about all the characters, including the villains and new characters that we are introduced to.We then meet Lando Calrissian who lives in Bespin, a city that floats among the clouds. Lucas hardly touched this masterpiece, but he still added some more striking visuals, most of which aren't unnecessary. More windows are added to the buildings in Bespin, adding lot more light and life to the settings. The visuals added aren't a bother anymore, and for once probably made a scene look better. Han and Leia don't trust Lando, to which we soon find out that they were right about their feelings toward him. Luke forsees that they're in trouble and goes to make sure that they're all right. As Han Solo is about to be frozen, Leia finally admits to Han that she loves her. To which Han replies with, ""I know."" It's an incredibly touching and emotional scene, where things are just about to get worse.As Luke arrives at Bespin, he encounters Darth Vader, to which father and son fight. Quite possibly the best Lightsaber fight in all the Star Wars films, the scene is filled with so much emotion and a shocking revelation. Luke sacrifices his own life rather than join the dark side, and is saved by Leia and Chewbacca, along with Lando, after much threats from Chewy. The film ends on such a downbeat note, keeping a cliffhanger for the final movie in the Trilogy. The characters have yet to face another adventure, and learn more from each other as the Imperial is yet to be beaten and Solo to be rescued. It's not a happy ending, or should I say, a beginning for the characters as what the future holds from them is yet to be known. It shouldn't be a suprrise from anyone that The Empire Strikes Back is considered by many as the best of the Trilogy, because the film is a great stepping-stone for the characters we've grown to love in the first film and introduces us to new ones that we easily grow to love and care for. That's what makes Star Wars a great Trilogy in the first place: it's the characters we remember. Not the visuals.10"
22933,False,"I have to admit, I never read the novel this is based on. But I'm guessing the people who don't like the movie at all (which is fine), either haven't read the book or don't like the book. I'm saying this, because what you are getting here, is very close to adult films. Something people in Germany (censors that is), do not have a problem with (the movie is rated 16+).I can only guess the movie will be NC-17 (if they rate it) in America. There are explicit images of male genitalia, a lot bare breasts (though mostly of our main female lead). With all that said, I went into the movie with the impression I wouldn't like it at all."
22934,False,"From it's opening scenes on the bleak ice-ball that is the planet Hoth, to its exciting finale on the cloud city of Bespin, The Empire Strikes back is a worthy sequel to the magnificent Star Wars. Taking over the directorial reins from George Lucas, Irvin Kershner steers the movie into darker territory to deliver a more mature movie than its predecessor.The Empire is still licking its wounds after the destruction of the Death Star, and evil Darth Vader is intent on finding the rebels responsible for destroying his new toy. Luke's aim, meanwhile, is to become a fully fledged Jedi knight, whilst Han sets himself a more difficult target: he plans on getting into Leia's knickers.With more incredible FX packed action scenes than you can shake a light-sabre at (highlights include the fantastic battle on Hoth, a chase scene through an asteroid field, and the Luke/Darth light-sabre duel), and THAT moment where we learn the truth about Luke's father, it's no surprise to find that this episode is often said to be the best of the series. Personally, A New Hope will always be my favourite (for sentimental reasons), but The Empire Strikes Back is a very close second."
22935,False,"This is one of my favorite movies, and one of the best movies that has ever been made.Star Wars was a great movie, and a sequel being better then it seemed impossible, but empire strikes back is a better movie with a lot of good stuff.The special effects are still good today and the story is pretty good, i love a lot things that this movie has that star wars didn't.Like a lot better fight scenes, and they show a lot more of places and planets then the 1st one.I was very pleased with this movie and think it is a great film for a true movie fan to watch, i disagree with a lot of people who say it is the best star wars movie.But i can understand why they say it, empire has a lot of things to it that are just well done and impressive.I think this movie is worth owning and is a movie you can watch many times."
22936,False,"If the first Star Wars (1977) was groundbreaking, this one is breathtaking! According to me at least - the best picture in film history! A culminated crown-jewel after a decade of excellent drama productions, such as The Godfather I & II, one flew over the cuckoo's nest etc, etc. Everything is there.. skillful focus on the character-arch.. a relaxed and charming love story.. fantastic action and heroism.. and above all- George Lucas story! What is going on inside that man.. ""A modern age Genius"". How does he come up with all that weird but super-cool stuff! And John Williams music..!! The themes and their crafted development to the story context.. wow.. Why he didn't get the academy award, still remains one of the biggest mysteries to me, up to this day.. If you find yourself crying, getting goosebumps and laughing at the same time when viewing this piece, don't worry- You're not alone...The force is strong with this one!!"
22937,False,"And damn if it didn't deliver the goods and a helluvalot more. It is so dark in theme it almost enters horror flick territory and that is brilliance in and of itself to go from one extreme to the other so fluidly and poetically. It worked in a way that The Temple of Doom just didn't with moviegoers. I suppose that was due in part to the cool suspenseful plot developments, particularly Yoda, Han and Leia's budding romance, but largely due to the Earth-shattering ""the world is not flat it's round"" surprise ending. I would bet when George Lucas wrote that scene down on paper he must have been either laughing maniacally and saying ""Nobody could ever have seen that coming in two billion light years!"" or crying with joy all the while with the one idea that ""This will be so golden that it will be remembered til the end of time and even after that."" As Hamill said so eloquently, ""In the Empire Strikes Back, everyone has problems. Luke has problems, Leia has problems, they turned Han into a coffee table!"" I must also include Silent Bob's quote ""She says 'I love you.' and like a pimp he says 'I know'."" It was the equivalent of dropping burning napalm on the audience. They must have been more stunned than people leaving the theaters after seeing the Exorcist for the first time. It was pure 100% movie magic and worthy of the original in every aspect."
22938,False,"One of the rare sequels which manages to surpass the original, The Empire Strikes Back is an all-time classic. A much more personal tale, this film is really all about the journey of young Luke Skywalker. A New Hope followed Skywalker as he became involved in the rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Here the rebellion is put on the back burner. This is less the story of a grand rebellion and more the story of one young man's growth as he continues to fulfill his destiny.We pick up with the rebels in hiding on a secret base on the remote ice world of Hoth. All the familiar figures from last time around are here, including Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca and the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO. And Luke Skywalker is here as well and it is Skywalker whom Darth Vader seems most interested in finding. Last time out Vader and the Empire were simply interested in wiping out the mostly anonymous rebels. Now, Vader has taken a personal interest in young Skywalker. The movie kicks into high gear as the Empire locates the rebel base and a great battle ensues. The rebels are forced to flee their base and here our heroes go off in different directions.Guided by the spirit of former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness in what is basically a cameo role) Luke Skywalker heads for the distant swampy planet of Dagobah where he is to be trained by the old Jedi master Yoda. Soon to be one of the most beloved characters in the series, Yoda is a 900-year old, two feet tall, green alien creature. The performances of puppeteer Frank Oz as Yoda and Mark Hamill as Skywalker are crucial here. Were the performances lacking audiences might have found it hard to believe these scenes where the young Jedi trainee converses and interacts with the rather odd little creature. But Hamill and Oz pull it off well. On Dagobah Luke (and the audience) learn much about the Force and the ways of the Jedi. In the original film the only Jedi we saw, Obi-Wan Kenobi was a rather mysterious figure. Now some light is shed on exactly who the Jedi are and what is required to become one.While Luke trains on Dagobah, Han Solo and Princess Leia are sidetracked on their journey to meet up with the rest of the rebels. Harrison Ford is terrific again playing Solo as he has the ultra-confident wiseguy role down pat. Carrie Fisher is again strong in the role of Leia, who drops some of the pretense of the last film and begins to give in to her rather obvious feelings for the swashbuckling Solo. Eventually Han and Leia make their way to Cloud City where we are introduced to another new character in the saga, Han's old friend Lando Calrissian. Han and Leia don't quite trust Lando and it soon becomes apparent that things in Cloud City are not quite what they seem. Sensing his friends are in danger Luke Skywalker leaves Dagobah to attempt to rescue them.Skywalker arrives in Cloud City to meet his destiny. Han, Leia and the rest of the characters fade into the background as the climax, much as the entire film, will be all about Luke Skywalker. Where the original Star Wars ended with an epic space battle, here everything leads up to a thrilling one-on-one showdown capped by one of the most jaw-dropping revelations ever seen in film.Some will say the ending of The Empire Strikes Back leaves the audience hanging. It is true there is not a clearly defined traditional ending as in the original film. But the ending here is powerful in its own way. It leaves you in great suspense, eagerly awaiting the inevitable conclusion to the saga. The film is not truly self-contained, it requires the knowledge of what has come before and the expectation of what will come after. It is by not going for the easy Hollywood ending that The Empire Strikes Back truly triumphs.Taken on its own merits The Empire Strikes Back can be said to even surpass the original Star Wars. The acting performances are again first-rate. Yoda is a fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable new character. In playing Lando Calrissian, Billy Dee Williams gives us someone well worth rooting for. Or against, we're not quite sure. The John Williams score, including the famed spine-chilling Imperial March, is magnificent. The visuals are dazzling, as would be expected. And most importantly we have a truly great story. The Empire Strikes Back, much more so than A New Hope, is Luke Skywalker's movie. It is fascinating to watch his journey as he moves towards fulfilling his ultimate destiny."
22939,False,"George Lucas' 'Star Wars' trilogy is the greatest fantasy story in all of film history. Yes, even better than the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. 'Lord of the Rings' is fine work but the characters aren't as well developed as in 'Star Wars' and they are too long. Also, each 'Star Wars' film stands out better than each 'Lord of the Rings' film. Three chapters in 'Lord of the Rings' is one big movie while 'Star Wars' is a space western, 'The Empire Strikes Back' is a dark, attractive and Gothic work of art and 'Return of the Jedi' is like a Disney film. Each has their own personality. As far as trilogies go altogether, 'The Godfather' films will always be the greatest in movie history'.I love 'The Empire Strikes Back' but I can't go along with the assertion that it is better than 'Star Wars'. I was one of those people that saw 'Star Wars' every weekend for a year when I was 11 and 12 years when a child's admission was only 50 cents to a dollar. There was such a magnificent freshness to 'Star Wars' that audiences couldn't get enough and when adjusted for inflation, 'Star Wars' is the second biggest box office film is history, second only to 1939's 'Gone with the Wind'. Meaning that these two films sold the most tickets in motion picture history.'Star Wars' even created the entire concept of the modern day blockbuster and influenced hundreds of films after it, is the biggest movie in the history of popular culture and created a new religion. A recent poll in Britain asked people to identify their religion and a substantial portion of them wrote in ""Jedi Knight"".'The Empire Strikes Back' does advance the story line forward greatly, has a convincing and blossoming love story between Han Solo and Pricess Leia and gives us the showdown we want. It also introduces us to the legendary Yoda and a new key player in Lando Calrissian and has some breath taking special effects. But 'The Empire Strikes Back' owes its success to 'Star Wars' but has to be given credit for the fact that it teaches people, especially the young, that the good guys don't always win and that the fight for what's right sometimes seems impossible."
22940,False,"Outstanding follow up to the original ""Star Wars,""with Luke Skywalker learning the ways of a Jedi Knight, while Darth Vader awaits a battle with Luke as he sets up Han Solo and Princess Leia. Amazing in the technical department once again. Unmatched. Unforgettable."
22941,False,"This film is bad in the sense that it is hardly a film at all. It has no structure, no dialogue, no screenplay, a threadbare story, but one that is not told because of non-existent direction, etc. It continues where the original left off, and just notches off plot elements one by one without any urge to tell a story, or develop characters, relationships, etc. The makers probably conceived this as a filler between numbers one and three and didn't bother with it. Of course, that's all right. I don't have any problem with that. But what really does disturb me is the high praise meted out to this ""film"" from almost every quarter  from viewers and critics alike. On this board it's being rated as the 17th best movie of all time. I've consulted quite a few film guides, and they all tag maximum, or near maximum, stars to this film. Even more bizarrely, they consider it to be the best of the series, and in my mind it's clearly the worst. What is going on? Of course, it's not difficult to see why this film is idolized. The first film was both good and a milestone. Not great, but it was the perfect statement for an age. It was a fairy tale that was confused as science fiction. The ""Force"" embodied morality, even religion, for the space age. It is set in the distant past and therefore pertains to origins rather than where technology is going. Spaceships and laser guns are just the backdrop, and have nothing to do with the story or the subject matter. When this film appeared in the middle of the crisis-ridden seventies, it really must have been a beacon of ""new hope"". And to put the ground-breaking special effects into its proper context, they symbolized optimism. There is no doubt that the effects served the story well, but they served even better the mood of the age. And with all this going, Star Wars rightly became a tremendous hit, and the focus of fanatic devotion. It was to be expected that any sequel would have been gobbled up by the fan base, as long as it didn't spoil the original. Empire doesn't spoil the original. It not only continues the war between good and evil, it does so with more spectacle, more aplomb, more special effects.When people say they like Empire, what I think they really mean is that thy like Star Wars so much that they are thrilled that it has a new and glossy wrapping. Because Empire is nothing but embellishment. They're not judging the film itself. The ideal situation would have been if Star Wars remained as a standalone fairy tale. Fairy tales end, and they leave us with the aura of ""happily ever after"". They don't go on and on and become sagas, and if they did that would totally destroy the aura. Empire is the first mistaken step towards saga, and that is why it quickly finds itself out of its depth. There is nothing else to be told, and that's why the film is so bad. One boring battle joined to another boring battle, and in between we have cardboard characters mouthing atrocious dialogue that serves no purpose whatsoever. The strain tells. Everybody is straining to do something when there is nothing to do. The third film, The Return of the Jedi, redeems itself by trying to finish a story. The prequels are interesting because they are filling in the background. But Empire is caught in no man's land. It is bad, and it should be exposed as such. All this pretending isn't healthy, I don't think."
22942,False,"I decided to watch this trilogy with a completely open mind to see what the fuss was all about. I was rather embarrassed by the fact that I had never seen any of these movies which were heralded as great cinematic classics. Instead of the masterpiece I was promised however , I was left with a great mediocrity. The characters were barely 2 dimensional , the plot was riddled with holes and horribly rushed and the dialogue was cheesy . Episode V was perhaps the least painful to watch but still isn't close to being good. I don't know if it's a case of a movie aging very badly but I can't for the life of me understand the allure of it. To each their own , I guess."
22943,False,"The only reason this film has such high marks is because people have grown up on 'Star Wars'. A simple story and impressive special effects for its time seems to have had an amazing impact in its day (which is long before mine) but should in hindsight be seen in a new light. It is no coincidence that the new Star Wars films receive such low marks (even though much of the acting and special effects are better) because they can't live up to those old childhood memories. Lucas wasn't even that original, given that Star Trek (and many other science fiction films) came before this. The Star Wars films pass for their special effects and level of entertainment but are clearly over-hyped and definitely overrated.."
22944,False,"This film is for SciFi fans. The film is for everyone 7 and older who love SciFi. The film has plenty of action to keep you in your seats. Luke Skywalker undergoes both Jedi training and we see his character develop from the rash young man he was in Star Wars IV. We also begin to see a hint into Darth Vader. I fell in love with Yoda in this movie. All the main characters from Star Wars IV are here. However, it is Luke and Yoda who steal the show. However, the movie did make me feel like I was between episodes and want more. I also felt that it really didn't have a true ending, just a closing of a chapter. However, it is very enjoyable and keeps the Star Wars saga going. Not only do I want more, a continuing story; but I want a beginning. Little did I know that all I had to do was wait a few years. If your are a Star Wars fan, be sure to include this one in your collection."
22945,False,"The Empire Strikes Back is an example of how well done a sequel can be, it takes the series to a whole new level and is an improvement over A New Hope. The amazing thing is that this time Lucas wasn't the director. That doesn't change anything, he guided Irvin and ESB is still his creation. This time everything is on a larger scale. The battles aren't puny and meaningless, they are actual battles. The movie starts with the battle for the icy world Hoth. From there the plot splits in 2, one being with Luke and one with the rest: Leia, Han, Chewie, 3PO and R2.We are explained in more detail how the Force works and we see how truly powerful the Empire is. Thanks to the money Lucas earned from A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back has better special effects and some splendid locations, including Hoth and Bespin.But it's not all about battles, the love story part of the series is also developed, Luke's struggle to understand the Force and use it continues, while Vader is more determined than ever.Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is a remarkable chapter of the Star Wars saga.Final Score: 5/5 or 10/10"
22946,False,"I'm not sure which part I liked more - this one or the original. But this part sure is better in some terms. Like special effects, which were really better than in the first part (probobly because of the bigger budged). It's also better in terms of action. The sword fights were much more impressive than in first part. The starship battles were also very impressive and pretty realistic. Many new colorful and very important characters appeared in this part. What else did I liked was Darth Vader's position in this part. Here he looked more dangerous and independent than in the first part. It's a really entertaining movie and it's worth watching."
22947,False,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning After George Lucas's Star Wars had wowed the world in 1977, the same world eagerly waited the big sequel that followed three years later, that was loved just as much, in some cases slightly more so, than the first film. It no doubt took twice as much effort to make, and drew in a huger box office crowd, and in doing so The Empire Strikes Back established itself as the film that rivalled the film it followed on from.All the main characters from the first film are back, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness) and lovable non humans Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-3PO, along with new addition Lando (a charismatic turn by Billy Dee Williams) a rogue pal of Han's who's now the head of his own establishment, as well of course as Yoda, the tiny green martian with wisdom who guides Luke on his way. The story's a bit too lost in names of special planets, spaceships and character names that only the most ardent sci-fi nerd is going to follow intently, but once again, the sheer spectacle and grandeur of Lucas's work over-shadows everything, a remarkable vision that still hasn't dated or staled over 25 years on.So sit back, relax and prepare to witness the sheer scale of escapist entertainment. *****"
22948,False,"Star Wars - Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back, rather suffers from 'middle child' syndrome.  Being the second of the original trilogy it has neither the fresh appeal of originality that marked its predecessor, nor is it required to reach any conclusions.  The result is a film with decidedly minimalist plot development.  The Empire is still hunting down the Rebel Alliance, Luke Skywalker is still training to be a Jedi knight, and. . . . .. . . . . well, that's pretty much it.  Instead of a solid storyline, the viewer is treated to 122 minutes of cobbled-together battle sequences (although watch for the impressive Imperial walker troop carriers, which resemble out-sized armoured elephants). The characters however, have developed considerably since the first film - it's nice to see loyal Chewbacca show a sense of humour.  The sexual tension between Princess Leia and Han Solo is palpable. . . . . . . . . . until they kiss (which looks about as exciting as snogging a shoe).  In a clever twist, Yoda the Jedi Master is not a Hercules-type warrior, but a wizened green dwarf; the characterisation would have worked even better had he not had a voice a-la-Sesame Street. In the Special Edition of Episode IV, A New Hope, there is an obvious and uncomfortable chasm between those scenes which have been unaltered since they were shot in 1977 and those that were digitally re-mastered and altered 20 years later.  Fortunately the same is not the case in Episode V.  But why was it necessary to darken the picture contrast so drastically? For fanatics The Empire Strikes Back is of course an integral component of the Star Wars dynasty.  Viewers with a more casual interest in the story could probably get away with skipping this installment altogether."
22949,False,"The Empire Strikes Back is the most suspenseful, well-paced and most emotional entry of the Star Wars saga. It's the greatest of movie sequels and as far as it goes, it is everything a sequel to a great movie is supposed to be: a darker tone, more development with the characters, universe expanding with some new and greater additions and features.The perfect adventure telling story that continues from where it left off from and delved deeper into the characters we all know and love today and introduced bigger places in the galaxy far far away that George Lucas originally introduced to us. The action is stunning, the visuals still look ground-breaking today. Empire overall, is just the best movie sequel ever and I don't know if I can call it the best of the original trilogy because its a tough choice between the three of them, to me.But I still love The Empire Strikes Back so 10/10."
22950,False,"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is arguably the best Star Wars film ever made, and one of the best films ever made. The film immortalized the already iconic characters that George Lucas created in Star Wars, while making a very dense and entertaining film. The Empire Strikes Back is so great because of the improvements made to Darth Vader, the ambitious tonal change, and the fact that it still contains one of the best twists ever. With enough analysis the most impressive thing about The Empire Strikes Back is how hard it is to find flaws in the film.Darth Vader still stands, and probably always will stand as one of the best villains ever brought to the screen, second on my list only to The Dark Knight's Joker. However, in Vader's first appearance Vader is slightly inconsistent in that he's a temperamental villain often yelling, which isn't nearly as scary as a villain who remains calm. I would contest that the best villains act like they are always in control, whether they are not, it is in The Empire Strikes Back that Vader develops into this villain, while also systematically murdering his failing accomplices. It could be argued that Vader's development helped the tonal change that Empire Strikes Back brought.It's another testament to the villain, when they are so chilling that the tone of the film seemingly dives with them. As Vader develops into the more controlled, systematic villain the tone of the film dives into a darker world. With Star Wars being considered, at least partially, a kids film it seems extremely ambitious of Lucas and Kershner to make a film directed at kids dark, something many filmmakers are unwilling to do today. The dark tone helps accentuate the character development as the characters hit their all time lows, and the film's tone represents that the world isn't always nice.The story for Empire Strikes Back, being the middle film in the trilogy, had the most freedom, and used it accordingly. The story of Empire Strikes back is arguably, the strongest in the series, as the film was one of the earliest to say the bad guy can win, in a giant blockbuster, another very ambitious move. However, the best element of the story is the unpredictable turns it makes, in particular it's iconic twist. The twist remains one of the most famous of all time, for a reason, and the film benefits from it.In the end Empire Strikes Back has the best story in the trilogy, the best character development, is very ambitious, and immortalizes it's iconic villain. On top of all of that it has been copied numerous times over the years, and remains one of the best films ever made. Empire Strikes Back still stands as the embodiment of what makes Star Wars so great."
22951,False,"Many people will give kudos to George Lucas for this movie but I won't. It isn't really his movie and you can tell which movies George Lucas did vs. the ones he didn't because the ones he had too much control over sucked. This movie did not suck.OK. I'm not a fan boy. I saw this movie like a billion times back in 1980. I own the original copies of the VHS and refuse to own the DVD or Blueray copies. George Lucas is brain dead for making the changes that he did and Han Solo shot first.This movie is a great classic. It goes down and one of my top ten movies of all time. It has all the aspects of a great story even if there are a ton of bugs through out the script and special effects. I don't care, it rocks.Rebels vs. Goliath. Outerspace. The Force. Lightsabers. Aliens. Cool stuff!Why can't they make more movies like this? Because directors are constantly trying to please those who want profit over art.10/10 stars is not enough for this movie."
22952,False,"For the 1977 film, see Star Wars (film). For other uses, see Star Wars (disambiguation). Star Wars is an American epic space opera franchise centered on a film series created by George Lucas. The film series, consisting of two trilogies (and an upcoming third), has spawned an extensive media franchise called the Expanded Universe including books, television series, computer and video games, and comic books. These supplements to the franchise resulted in significant development of the series' fictional universe, keeping the franchise active in the 16- year interim between the two film trilogies. The franchise depicts a galaxy described as ""far, far away"" in the distant past, and commonly portrays Jedi as a representation of good, in conflict with the Sith, their evil counterpart. Their weapon of choice, the lightsaber, is commonly recognized in popular culture. The franchise's story lines contain many themes, with strong influences from philosophy and religion. author: http://www.internetvietnam.net/Have a nice day."
22953,False,"In my opinion this is not only better than the first film or the fourth whatever but it is the best in the entire franchise. I loved it from the first minute until the last, I love star wars even since I was about 4 years old and I used to hate this movie but when I watch it now it's just amazing. Also in this film great Star Wars characters make their debut with the likes of Yoda and Orlnado Calrizion (if that is how you spell it and I can't remember if it is Orlando and Lando so excuse me if I got it wrong.)This film starred Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford & Carrie FisherI highly recommend this film to all you sci-fi fans****/***** not outstanding but very good"
22954,False,"Top of the line for a majority of Star Wars geeks, and for good reason. It's the ideal melting pot of George Lucas's vast, quirky imagination, his influences' knack for dark, large-scale epics, and his key contributors' determined efforts to retain a central humanism amidst all the creatures, effects and operatic indulgences. A wildly ambitious picture, it's genuinely amazing just how much territory is covered over the course of two hours. Lucas and company manage to leap from the Hoth battle to Yoda on Dagobah, the asteroid field to Lando and Cloud City, before finally climaxing with the classic Luke / Vader showdown and revelation. That's an awful lot of set pieces, not to mention some seriously powerful plot points, but smooth talking and a few outstanding performances keep the film from feeling over-stuffed or under-explored. The cast, too, grows on an individual basis almost universally, with Luke wrapping himself in the wisdom of the Jedi, Han and Leia developing genuine chemistry and Darth Vader, in a surprise twist that should never have been so effective, actually showing some signs of humanity. Although it can be hammy from time to time, those moments are balanced expertly by a wonderful series of mountains and valleys, to the point that they stop being seen as negatives and instead contribute to the picture's eccentricity. A legendary effort that's just as monumental, entrancing and electric thirty years later, it's damn near perfect."
22955,False,"It is not always possible for a sequel to re-capture the peculiar magic of an original film. 'The Empire Strikes Back' manages to do so by being less of a sequel than it is a new film on its own. The story begun in 'Star Wars' is advanced, the characters & their relationships with one another are deepened and the film itself abandons much of the easy spirit of the first film in favour of a darker and more uncertain tone. If the first film was largely about heroism, the second is largely concerned with struggle. The main characters are soundly tested in this film and for the most part, they come up short.This is also the film that transforms Darth Vader into one of the screen's great villains. Vader was interesting in 'Star Wars,' but he is iconic in 'The Empire Strikes Back' and he rightfully takes his place as not only a great villain, but a great character. In spite of the despair that runs through the film, the visuals and imagination so apparent in 'Star Wars' returns here, as well. The film is littered with awesome action sequences and more than enough 'coolness' to measure up to its predecessor.Again, the original (1980) version is the one to see - if given the option - although the enhancements made to this film are somewhat less invasive than those applied to 'Star Wars.' Still, the film is more charming and more polished its original release. It is considerably less delightful than its predecessor, but it is every bit as good of a film, if not even slightly superior to 'Star Wars.'"
22956,False,"I saw this movie in the theater in 1980 multiple times and many times since. It is a great film and tasty ""meat between the sandwich"" sitting in between A New Hope and Return of the Jedi. This film has it all from a battle in the snow with mechanical walking beasts, a trip to a swamp planet to introduce the legendary Jedi master, a beautiful city in the clouds that houses the climatic end to the film. This film is darker and more menacing than the other 2 films including a more evil Darth Vader and introductions to the mysterious Bounty Hunters including Boba Fett. Excellent effects, beautiful locations, top character development and Masterful directing. Go rent it out, you wont be disappointed."
22957,False,"When talking about The Empire Strikes Back many people have commented on how dark it is in comparison to the other two films from the original trilogy. However as was expected by Star Wars fans, Revenge of the Sith without a doubt took the title of Darkest Star Wars movie from Empire's mantle. Given the galactic scale of tragedy in the final prequel, Empire's personal tragedy reveals itself to be a little self-absorbed. In the post-prequel Star Wars paradigm, we should be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel in the final revelations of Empire.With the issue of darkness settled, the Star Wars audience and the movie-going public should now be able to see The Empire Strikes Back for what it is. The best Star Wars movie. And not only is it a great Star Wars movie, but it is a great movie. The direction, the writing, and even the performances come together to make it a complete movie.Watching the movies that George Lucas has directed, specifically Star Wars: Episodes I-IV, you can tell he is not a student of the craft of acting. The result is that actors are left developing the emotional life of the characters on their own. Some actors are able to survive and even thrive in this environment. Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness give inspired performances in the original Star Wars that make some of the other performances in the movie appear worse than they actually were.George Lucas responsibly tapped his professor from film school, Irvin Kershner, to direct The Empire Strikes Back, and the difference is palpable. Star Wars is without a doubt the most revolutionary in terms of Special Effects of the original trilogy. But in terms of quality movie-making, editing, cinematography, etc., Emipire takes the cake. And all the while putting together great shot after great shot, he managed to pull good performances out of most the cast. Not a single one of the primaries are flat or perform an unbelievable moment. Hamill's performance is so good you actually believe for at least a few minutes that he might stand a chance against Darth Vader.But the quality of film-making and the emotional life of the characters would not have mattered, nor could they have possibly existed without brilliant writing. In Empire Lucas is at his myth-making best (Han's metaphoric descent into hell and Luke's journey into the Dark Cave are brilliant), and the screenplay by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasden is sharp, well-paced, and energetic. As a result of this three-part collaboration, you have the rough and romantic flirtations of Han Solo and Princess Leia (in which you can hear the voice of both Brackett's earlier work, The Big Sleep and El Dorado, and Kasden's later work, The Big Chill and The Accidental Tourist). Also you have Yoda-speech when it was genuinely profound in a Confucian way, before it devolved into the gimmicky and painful form it takes in the prequels.On the whole there is no denying that Star Wars: A New Hope is the most influential movie of the series, quite possibly of the last quarter of the twentieth century (although it would have to fight with Jaws for that title). And with the fall of Anakin Skywalker in Revenge of the Sith, it no longer can be called the darkest of the Star Wars saga. But it is, with little doubt the best movie of the series."
22958,False,"One of my seven 10s (of my about 200 rated movies) are given to this movie. And when I first wanted to vote for it, I had just seen it, yet again experienced the class, the acts, the dialogue, the action, the characters, the amazing adventures of Han, Luke and the rest. And let's just say that I hadn't seen it in years just before I voted. And a 10 sounded so, well, unreal, especially when you should actually presume that it's the original Star Wars which deserves a 10. If one of the movies should have one. But it was this one I found right. I still do. I am sure that this is the absolutely greatest adventure movie of all time. Of all Star Wars movies. Of the Indiana Jones movies. And of the Lord Of The Rings movies. Of every adventure movie I have seen, this one is the very best. Why, you will probably ask. Most people I know either prefer Star Wars IV or VI to this one. But I think they forget to take acquintance to the amazing chemistry there is between all the cast in this movie. And the classic scenes, there are many more than in the other movies. Luke meeting Yoda, and Yoda's amazing wisdom for such a small, little green alien. Vader confronts Luke. The truth revealed. Han and Leia's first kiss, and C-3POs interference. The introduction of Lando. Boba Fett. Admiral Piett's absurd rise to great Imperial stature. The battle of Hoth. Han frozen into carbonite. Just about everything of the dialogue, acting, everything of it is so classic, so climatic, so absolutely real. The Empire Strikes Back is the absolutely finest film in the entire Star Wars series. It's so intense, its plot and subplots are perfectly intertwined, just about everything in the film is perfectly fit for its genre. This is why this movie deserves a 10."
22959,False,"Empire Strikes Back is not only a great sequel to one of the best science Fiction movies ever made but its probably one of the best sequels ever made. A movie that not only blows away the first film in terms of scoop and magnitude but in story telling as well. This is the second of the entire Star Wars series of movies and in no doubt, the best. Not even the movies that come after were able to capture the landscape of this great cinematic achievement.Don't dare call yourself a Star Wars fan if you have not seen it."
22960,False,"This is how sequels should always be done.  Higher budget.  Preplanned story arc.  And memorable dialogue.  The best sequel ever made hands down.  In many ways this film is even better than its predecessor.  But, unfortunately, because it doesn't stand so well on its own, it will always be considered the second best Star Wars movie."
22961,False,"When I first saw The Empire Strikes Back I didn't really care for it. I wasn't really into the darkness that covered the movie. Now, I'm a little older and can appreciate this movie. This is the best Star Wars movie hands down. Not my favorite, but the greatest. This takes the Star Wars saga to a whole new level with the introduction of Yoda and the fleshing out of Darth Vader. Every returning character from A New Hope is given so much more to work with and it shows. We learn more about Han's past, Luke's past, and Luke's future. The visual feel of the movie is incredible. From Bespin, the cloud city to Dagobah, the lonely hideout for Master Yoda, each one of the locations presented support the turmoiled, chill of space feel that dominates the movie.The climax of the movie is the most memorable climax of all time. It's been alluded to more times than can be counted. It also takes the battle between good and evil from a back and white area to a shade of gray. The fact that the innocence of Luke can come from the pure evil of Darth Vader is perhaps the biggest revelation. This is one of the best sequels of all time. Check it out.**** out of ****"
22962,False,"When The Empire Strikes Back was released for the first time, I didn't think it would be as good as the very first Star Wars that was released because usually a sequel isn't as good as a prequel. But boy was I ever wrong!!! In my opinion, I think that this is not only the best sequel, but the best movie ever made.Everthing about this movie is excellent, from the battle that's taken place on Hoth, to the climatic battle between Darth Vader and Luke Skwalker, where Luke finds out about his secret destiny.....This movie also introduces a new character named Yoda {who is about the size of a dachshund when it stands on 2 legs}. If you were to see Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of The Clones, you would find out why people in the Star Wars universe call him ""master"". I like the way he sounds like say fozzie bear from the muppet babies and his backwards spelling like, ""Powerful jedi, was he.""As I said with another review about ""Return Of The Jedi"", I owe it all to George Lucas. Without him, Star Wars wouldn't have been created. Thanks George Lucas!"
22963,False,"So, I was almost 1 when this movie dropped and, well, it started the opening night tradition.OK, well, how to do this? I guess we will start with the hate. I like to address the hate in movies, especially ones that are well regarded and loved.Now, I'll excuse it for the people that just don't like Star Wars. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.But then there are the people that really hate Empire because of...reasons. And those reasons are Revenge of the Sith.I'm sorry, panning Empire because of loyalty to the prequels--misplaced as it is--doesn't make I-III any better. It just makes you petty.Now, why its loved and, I'll admit, I am one of those fanboys that really do love this movie.For starters, Empire went dark. It was the really the episode that the good guys lost and, that made it unique among, well, among just about every movie not made in the 1970s. I guess that is what made the 70s such a wonderful time for movies.We could use a little more of that. We could use a lot more of that. We use a lot more gritty in cinema. And, we could use a lot more ""lived in"" Everything looks too clean.Empire had that.And then it had that big, legendary, reveal that made all those kisses between Luke and Leia utterly wrong once the second big reveal hit in 1983...which explained that look Han gave Leia when she told him in the next installment.Moving on...We have the Battle of Hoth, which, yeah, nerd awesomeness with kind of a WWI trench warfare v tanks feel and a WWII Evacuation of Dunkirk feel with the rebels on the run and the Empire forcing its way across the galaxy with brute strength.And that prolonged time on the Falcon, well, that was just brilliant for character development and, incest blocking.So, really, honestly, there was way too much to love not to put Empire on the throne."
22964,False,"This movie is a flawless masterpiece.The Empire Strikes Back is not only the best of the Original Trilogy but one of the best sequels ever made(with The Godfather Part II and The Dark Knight).The Empire is darker than its predecessor,it develops our beloved characters from A New Hope and makes them more relate-able and complex.It also introduces new characters that became fan favorites.This movie has a complex,dark plot with depth and shocking twists.The film is full of incredible dialogue with memorable and quotable lines.It goes without saying that the visuals are mind blowing and the music score by John Williams is iconic.In a nutshell Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes back is a dark, mature sequel that exceeded the original and it is considered one of the best films of all time that you totally have to see(but you probably saw a million times)"
22965,False,"The Empire Strikes Back is the best film in the original Star Wars trilogy. It has all the great qualities that the original Star Wars has: great effects (at the time of its release), appealing characters, and lots of spellbinding action. It also has eliminated some of the problems that plagued the first: the storyline is tighter, and goes much deeper into character development. The performances are terrific, especially by Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. George Lucas has also remembered to include a spellbinding battle sequence with the snowspeeder sequence near the beginning of the film. The conclusion, with a lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire series. This is a truly wondrous film, and serves as a constant reminder that just because a movie is expensive and a blockbuster doesn't mean that it has to be shallow and two dimensional. This film will undoubtedly entertain viewers of all ages from start to finish."
22966,False,"I am a chain si-fi movie watcher. What ever I can remember, Stars Wars is the base of all science Fiction movie from Hollywood. All of these things come into play in my position, but I'm mostly analyzing my picks on the effect they had on me, both when I actually formerly viewed them and today. As always, I actually appreciate your feedback in the section below, but most of all, would want to see your rating of the films. With out further delay, on to the list"
22967,False,"Star Wars Episode 5 The Empire Strikes Back tells the story of the evil galactic empire attacking the hopeless rebellion after the destruction of the Death Star. One thing that I feel is worth noting right off the bat is that I don't think this film surpasses A New Hope but is ratter on the same level in terms of substance as well as quality.What makes this film good is that it is able to keep its focus on the characters in a universe that is so interesting as well as vast. That is something that makes the original trilogy better in my opinion because in the prequels it was focused on showing us heavily C.G.I. visuals ratter then on the characters. This is one of many factors that make the original trilogy by far the superior films. The plot is also more complex then the first of this trilogy which shows that the people involved with this project were taking risks. The characters were all likable and interesting. And the fact that they filmed at real locations shows dedication from the director Irvin Kershner.The cons of this picture though are not minimal which leads me to feeling as though it is grossly overrated. The acting and dialogue is still hooky, the effects are showing age, the action is underwhelming, and unfortunately the fan base that surrounds Star Wars has made it difficult to watch Empire as it was intended. The story although complex is occasionally driven forward by plot convinces. And although I did not see this infamous twist coming, I also was not all that wowed.In conclusion The Empire Strikes Back is complex and has relatable characters which is able to drive this picture forward as well as be entertaining. And I'm giving this one a 6/10."
22968,False,"By far my favorite Star Wars movie. Contains the iconic parts of the saga, for example the reveal of Darth Vader. The settings for the entire movie are outstanding from Hoth to Cloud City. As always the score from John Williams was on point more so than ever in my opinion. The movie is set between episodes 4 and 6 doing a perfect job of not only carrying through the success of the first movie and surpassing it in my opinion but also does an amazing job of setting up episode 6 to conclude the trilogy without leaving an annoying cliffhanger at the last minute. The characters really establish themselves with more famous moments such as Han Solo's ""I know"" line towards the end of the movie and we get to see Luke's agony as he hangs from cloud city."
22969,False,"The Empire Strikes Back is a 1980 epic space opera/space fantasy film directed by George Lucas and direct sequel to Star Wars. As a brief summary, The Empire Strikes Back is a classic example of a movie that the critics of the time got very wrong. Initially receiving mixed reviews and being slammed by some is nowadays considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time and the best Star Wars film overall...and its not hard to see why! The Empire Strikes Back continues on from the events of Star Wars revisiting the characters of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo. The Empire Strikes Back is known to be the much darker sequel, with much more character depth, vulnerability and emotion. Lucas continues to develop his beloved characters in all the right ways with the Han-Leia relationship, the more powerful feeling of friendship and of course the biggest, most shocking twist in cinematic history with Vader and Luke in the final act of the film. The Empire Strikes Back also continues to evolve the world introducing us to new places, new characters such as the legendary Jedi master, Yoda, improving the special effects and an even more beautiful soundtrack, provided by John Williams. The Empire Strikes Back is a perfect example of a sequel done right, equal and at times even better than the original. Epic battles, intense space chases, powerful emotional character development, shocking twists, thought-provoking ideas, themes and messages and finally groundbreaking sequences and special effects. In terms of flaws The Empire Strikes Back virtually has none whatsoever, other than an unfortunate twist which has had a negative response later on in the franchise, a few unnecessarily long scenes of Luke's training, and in my opinion a slightly weaker general plot than the original story. These however barely affect this near perfect masterpiece of a movie. 9/10"
22970,False,"What a Shocker...I think this one is everyone's favourite as nearly every single fan will say ""This is the Best Star Wars Movie of All Time"" and I agree with them, but that's not the main reason why I love it.It's always hard to make a sequel better than the first installment, and this was more successful. Unlike the first one, they made it darker and they explored the series.We got to see more worlds and we got to know more about the Jedi and how the Force works, the Lightsaber duel in this is really intense, much quicker and precise.Another reason why I love this one is because the Bad Guys win, which is surprisingly rare, we get Han Solo captured by Boba Fett the Bounty Hunter, Vader wins the fight and the heroes still don't want to give up. And also this was the film that gave us the greatest plot twist of all.Also, Yoda is awesome."
22971,False,This movie was a true film making classic. Any story that can take place in 3 unique environments and space while telling thee classic good versus evil (with a twist Vader as the dad)is worthy of a movie this good. It is a reminder on an era of movie making when film makers took a risk with using more elaborate special effects in their shots. This movie started a flood of great 80's films that allowed you to get lost in a new world of far away people. Empire Strikes Back stands out as the best of the stories in the original trilogy as there is simply more story and more characters involved. This movie is a great family as well and is a great way to spend a family night in.
22972,False,"Good lord, what spell does George Lucas have everyone under? This is one of the highest ranked films on the website; it's regarded as one of the greatest sequels of all time; it's on most lists entitled the 'greatest motions pictures' of the respective genre; it's a film nearly everyone likes - and yet it failed, for me, to do any of these things justice upon recently seeing it for the first time. Perhaps you had to be there; to see it on opening night at a time when there was no such thing as the Internet on which you could download and/or watch special teasers or trailers; at a time when the studio were not able to give you the first five minutes as an appetiser to get you to see it; at a time when the only manner in which you could discuss the up and coming franchise episodes were face-to-face and not on message boards. Although it's too bad it isn't more like that nowadays.Maybe it's futile criticising it now, but at the end of the day, it's still just a film. Perhaps you really did have to be there on opening night with no knowledge of what awaited you, preparing yourself to be propelled into a world of monsters, space travel and aliens as you left your brain at the door. But I do think most people rate the film based on childhood experiences more than the film itself  they don't ask themselves the question 'How good was the film?', they ask themselves 'How happy was I as a kid when I first saw this?'.For the record, I liked the previous episode. I thought it was good fun and relatively light-hearted with a sense of vision going for it throughout. You really believed Lucas had an idea and desperately wanted to follow through on his vision. This twinned with the scope of ideas to do with space travel and the structuring of space stations, look of attire and general mise-en-scene enforces the evidence Lucas loved an idea to the point it was an obsession, an obsession he let everyone else into and love in equal measure.Alas, Episode V entitled 'The Empire Strikes Back' from 1980 is actually quite silly and removes any feeling or excitement the prior episode may have instilled into one. Its overall idea is that the young and upcoming hero in Luke Skywalker (Hamill) is to go off and train to take his skills to the next level and become a Jedi whilst friends Han Solo (Ford) and co. are chased down by the evil forces led by Darth Vader (Prowse/Jones).'Fine' you think, this may well be more interesting now that the introductions and general establishment of good versus evil has been dealt with; there also seems to be a self discovery journey going on. But if anything, the film is less interesting than the first one, particularly after about an hour after which it transcends into a bunch of slightly interesting scenes set on space ships and odd jungle infested planets. Once all that has happened, Vader gets some hired guns to find the rebels and more stuff happens that just has you passively sit there and watch it all unfold.Maybe it's that I cannot just let myself go, but I had no problem with the 1st and 4th episodes in terms of narrative, which were actually quite interesting as this broad and quite epic setting was used to transfer good and evil across a galaxy. In this one, there doesn't feel like anything at stake. The film's protagonist Luke is safe and sound on a jungle planet with Yoda, being taught what he needs to know, so he's fine, whereas Solo and co. are hopping around trying to dodge the forces of evil and the problem is you never feel any connection to them. Why should you feel any towards an annoying, big, hairy creature; daft comic relief robots and an underdeveloped, expressionless and somewhat empty headed woman who goes by the name Leia (Fisher).But these things are the bigger picture. The film has all number of frustrations going on at spaced intervals. Of course, Solo and co. never get hit by any of the laser beams and they can hide in that meteor storm nice and easily but again, criticising it seems futile. One thing I noticed on several occasions was that everyone in the Millennium Falcon kept talking over each other, which also annoyed me and the heavy handed catalyst which pushes Luke off into his training with Yoda is a near death experience on ice planet Hoth, during which he nearly freezes to death amongst being eaten.Towards the end of the film, Luke will be having a showdown with Vader after which a famous line is uttered. All well and good but Luke doesn't go down into the bowels to fight Vader because it's the realistic choice, he goes down there because we want him to  we want him to fight and the story demands he put his new Jedi skills into practice so that all can see how much he's really learnt. This is after the film goes needlessly 'dark' for one scene involving the freezing/supposed death of a main character and no, the film is 'dark' for that one scene; not from the start and throughout, it's still that laser dodging, fast talking, monster eliminating 'fun' the prior film was. All in all, The Empire Strikes Back is underwhelming and viewing it now makes it seems quite silly more than anything. Perhaps proof 'event cinema' can and never will withstand the true test of time."
22973,False,This is my favorite movie of all time. I grew up watching the original trilogy and I have been into Star Wars and movies ever since. This movie and King Kong are really important to me because if it was'nt for them I would'nt be the same. Anyway the plot summary. The plot is great and original. I love how this was one of the first movies where the baddies win. Come on the bad guys gotta win sometime. It is'nt fair that the goodie tooshoo's always win. The effects are some of the best I've ever seen. They were the best in their time and the best today. The acting is great as well. The actors take great passion and empathy in their roles and it helps make the movie so great. Overall this is the best movie ever made and if you have'nt seen it you are missing out.
22974,False,"The second ""Star Wars"" film to be released has non-stop action, but the problem is that there is no compelling plot to make the action interesting. Endless shots of star ships gliding through space soon become tedious. The last third of the movie does generate some interest but it's too little, too late to save this from being more than a mediocre entry in the series. The other problem is that it just stops abruptly, relying too much on the sequel to clean up the loose ends. The dialog is amateurish and there is too much emphasis on special effects. Yoda is cute but Chewbacca and R2-D2 become increasingly annoying with the silly noises they make."
22975,False,"After the indescribable success of the first amazing Star Wars film, people were hungry for more, so George Lucas decided to go ahead and make a sequel.You think it would be hard to live up to the film of the century, yet George Lucas does it again effortlessly, and an even better job.Almost everything about this film is perfect; the format of the story, the classic sword fight, the story itself, the special effects, everything was just unbelievable, I could go on for days.It is very hard to describe how epic this movie is. I love the Dagobah scenes, they were spectacular, and I liked Yoda even better than good old Obi-Wan Kenobi. The city in the clouds is fantastic, and when you first see Darth Vader there you could kiss George Lucas for doing such a good job. The sword fight in this film is faster and cooler, and the dramatic lines at the end is great. Han Solo and Princess Leia were made for each other, and Han Solo's last scene in the film shows how much he has matured as an actor.There were two things that bothered me about this film, though. The first is the first 15 minutes of the film. It's just a very weak opening, and it seems longer than it actually it is. However, that is made up for by the amazing battle scene on Hoth. Another is when Luke and Leia kiss; it just doesn't seem right.Other than that, the movie hit perfection on technically every level. Darth Vader is as creepy as ever (especially when you see the back of his actual head and you wonder what's on the other side), and his theme music is great, along with the rest of John William's grand score.The Empire Strikes Back, overall, is a masterpiece, and should be #5 on the Top 250 list. It's one of my favorite movies, and it is definitely one of the greatest movies of ALL time (as in all the movies in history). 9.9/10 (almost a 10, that's how good it is)."
22976,False,"VOTE USCWANNABE My name is Tom Costabile and I am currently the lead runner up in the Presidency contest at Hyperspace.com, known on that site as USCWANNABE. I have been intently working on trying to win this election and have come to the conclusion that I can't win this with just friends and family...I'm going to need the help of the millions of fans Star Wars has adopted for itself to win this contest so I've decided to write this letter to introduce myself and my ideas for the fan club presidency. I went back to school and got my GED. I went to college for Media Arts and Animation (because I wanted to be GL) and got my bachelors. I moved to Studio City, Ca to go to USC and started my real life, the one I envisioned when I was 5, and within 3 years I own multiple corporations, my dream houses, my dream cars, I don't do drugs or drink In essence, I have everything I have ever wanted for myself and I have Star Wars and George Lucas to thank for it, and my way of giving back is to take my place in the SW world and be the best damn Fan Club president anyone can. I have a few ideas for how I can make it better for us as fans : I feel that we are entering a very scary time in terms of our beloved Star Wars. For the first time in SW history we are in a realm of uncertainty as to what's going to happen next. For the entire time SW has been in our lives we knew there was going to be more, it was just a matter of time, and now, according to Lucas there will never be another film. Of course we're going to have the video games, the board games and the television shows and so on, but nothing, absolutely nothing can compare to watching the midnight showing of a new Star Wars film. It's probably the greatest experiences of my life and I don't want it to end! I feel that there is a way around this though. If there were more conventions than SW would stay alive forever. If we as fans can come together more frequently I believe SW would never leave us and its that simple. We need to urge LucasFilm to produce more functions in more cities all over the world in order to satisfy the needs of the true fans and as president this will be my number one priority. Not just every 3 years, but every year. Not in just one city but multiple cities. One of the things I found to be disturbing was that because it was in Indianapolis, and only in Indianapolis, it was extremely hard for a lot of people to come there. They would have to get time off work, save up money, and make room for this in their personal lives. These reasons deterred a lot of people away and that I feel is not fair to them. It should not cost an extrordinary amount of money and time to celebrate these films and now that there won't be any movies its all we have to look forward to as a group. If LucasFilm will not cooperate with this I feel that we should come together as a group and make it happen ourselves and as President of the fan club I would be more than happy to make all of the arrangements and make this happen! I also feel that SW fans are probably the most enlightened and creative people on the planet. We at an early age saw the talent that went into making these films and have been trying to find that talent within ourselves ever since, and the best part about it is many of us have but we don't know what to do with it!! Especially in a day and age where there are more film students than law students and a time where the world is the smallest its ever been in the history of the Earth. We as a society are watching films from England, France, Japan and so on and seeing the impact that SW has had on not just the USA, but the world!! I propose that if I become president I begin an organization where people from all over the planet can submit their artworks (not just SW stuff) and gain the assistance of people in the entertainment industry. From writing to storyboarding to CGI to film and all that has to do with it. An organization by SW fans for SW fans!! A way to come up and not need no one but ourselves to make it happen. If we took all the talent that is in the group of people that will read this letter and put it together in a serious way your talking American Zoetrope to the tenth power. Your talking about possibly the next wave of great filmmakers. A way for me to give back.I felt an obligation to do this. If I don't win this contest I want everyone who reads this to know how I feel about everything that has been going on around us in the SW society as an extremely concerned fan. I think that everyone I have ever met at the conventions and the midnight showings and the Weekends at Disney have been the greatest, greatest group of people this world has to offer, and I am so greateful that I'm a part of it. May the force be with you all. Thomas Costabile USCWANNABE"
22977,False,"Easily the best star wars film of the set! However, if you're reading this comment, then you will have most probably seen ""a new hope"" (first film) and therefore wont need much persuading........You will not be disappointed in any way!!! Without giving anything away, just imagine more of the first film but in a bigger, faster and therefore, better fashion.....As usual, the special FX are amazing considering date of production. To be honest, if you're reading this having not seen the film, you should be ashamed and My advice would be,to buy the trilogy boxset - it will soon become a prized possession, one of them that you WILL watch over and over again...If you have seen it, then you know what I'm talking about and no doubt love the film as much as i do!!!!"
22978,False,"Again, the magic of Star Wars will not be forgotten. This is one of those films you just have to see in your life. And some of the most memorable lines in movie history are in here, so I would strongly reccommend for movie freaks.8/10"
22979,False,It really does seem that over time some movies do tend to take on an aura that is not worthy of them. The fact that the Empire Strikes back has gained such a following is evidence to this. The film has holes in its story the size of its budget and many of the roles are painfully one dimensional. If this movie was released today it would receive the same rubbishing that the two newer installments received and it would be well deserved.
22980,False,"Another Lucas masterpiece. This film is just a little bit weaker than the first, or perhaps the impact of some of the SFX was lessened by the fact that they were pretty much the same as the Episode IV. While they were novel in the first film, they were expected in this film. Still, a great film. This entire series is destined to become ""Classic"", et al. I think that people went into this film with high expectations and were not disappointed. I wasn't, not really - it's a great film. Still, as I said, just a LITTLE bit less great than the first one."
22981,False,"In a saga that is full of great stories, Empire shines. There wasn't as much at stake as there was in A New Hope, but there was still a lot to unpack. You cared about every storyline and the reveal at the end changes the entire universe."
22982,False,"Empire Strikes Back starts with a bumpy plot, dialogue, cinematography, and acting. But as the movie progresses, you start to feel that it's a masterpiece. From the beginning of the Battle of Hoth, the movie elevates as it goes on. Every scene feels more mature than what comes before it. The music is perfect in every sense; in fact, it makes the stakes feel more elevated. Darth Vader proves to be the best villain in cinema history, while our protagonists feel much more mature and developed than in 'A New Hope'. For an 80's film, Empire Strikes Back is shot magnificently, and some shots look and feel as modern as most blockbusters today. The performances are a big improvement; every actor or actress plays his or her part extraordinarily, mainly because the characters are put through challenging obstacles. The film drags at some moments, such as the asteroid worm scene, which takes you out of the movie for moments. Everything else earns the movie a deserved ""Movie of the decade"" award (at least from fans)."
22983,False,"The Empire Strikes Back is more than just a sequel to one of the most successful movies ever made; it redefined what a sequel could be. You could take a pre-existing story, expand upon it greatly and STILL make it a well-rounded and debatably self-contained movie. Empire reprises the stars of the original Star Wars movie and makes them all shine; Mark Hamill is great as a self-doubting yet well-meaning hero, Harrison Ford again gives a great take on cinema's most loveable scoundrel Han Solo, and the late Carrie Fisher gives Princess Leia a post-Alien sci-fi feminist makeover in that she's no longer anyone's damsel, but her own strong-hearted woman.Need I say more as to why The Empire Strikes Back is considered the best sequel ever made? It's become the go-to film when comparing film sequels in general. Though it's become an overused cliche to compare sequels to Empire, it's true. You can't really argue with the best of the best. A story of heroes on the run and the baddies closing in is still great especially when it's a space-opera that explores aspects on human spirituality.I could go on about why the film's great, why George Lucas made the least changes to this film in The Original Trilogy's Special Editions and why Empire was for a time the most successful independent movie ever made. But why should I? The film speaks for itself. The music, the writing, the direction and the acting all add up to the very best film in the Star Wars saga.This is a sequel that can easily be recognised, appreciated and seen as its own movie. Though it does help watching this back-to-back with the original. It's something few sequels can be: medium-art."
22984,False,"One of those rare moments in cinematic history when the stars aligned in an axis of perfection.
Everything is right, plot,writng, environments, characters, character development, visualisation and musical score......all sublime.
Not just the greatest Star Wars film but also one of the greatest films of all time."
22985,False,"Empire is a deservedly a masterpiece of cinema all by itself. Let alone as a Star Wars film.
It took the world of Star Wars into a fittingly more dark and intense direction. Filled with character depth and gorgeous new landscapes.
Empire is the definition of smart filmmaking. It had to live up to an insane amount of hype and it made it look easy.
We must never forget this films brilliance.
The actors are at their best. The effects are great! They still hold up today.
It's plot takes riskier turns and ends up so much more rewarding.
It's no Episode V. It's a classic piece of history."
22986,False,"A fun, slow, action-packed sequel that makes fans fall in love with the Star Wars saga again. This was a very good, and perfectly made film if you compare it to other films that were released around its time. The movie was one of the most loved Star Wars films ever... but I can't really agree on that. As I mentioned before it was kind of slow, but still surprisingly enjoyable."
22987,False,"Touted as among the definitive way to make a sequel ever, Empire gives the bad guys their due. Darker, somber, and with that now famous plot twist towards the end that every nerd dad introduces to their millennial kid (search your feelings, you know it to be true). Empire not only expands on the universe that A New Hope established, but they play with it in creative ways, such as the arctic battle on the ice moon of Hoth (why aren't Imperial Walkers a real thing yet in 2017), the chase scene in the asteroid belt (that is clever, especially in 1980), the lightsabre fight (though to be honest, the choreography doesn't age too well with time). If you watched A New Hope, there's no excuse not to watch Empire Strikes Back."
22988,False,"I recently watched the original Star Wars trilogy (1977-1983) in order to see how good these films really are. I already pointed out that I won't be seeing Star Wars: The Last Jedi in a theater because Star Wars: The Force Awakens really disappointed me. The Force Awakens is perhaps the most shallow, uninspired piece of filmmaking that I've ever seen in my life. Actually, recently, I got a lot of enjoyment out of reading user reviews of The Force Awakens on IMDb. Almost all the popular reviews on IMDb gave this film a rating of one out of a possible ten stars. On the other hand, almost all paid film critics praised The Force Awakens when it was released. As some people pointed out, this shows that film critics working for popular newspapers and websites can't be trusted. They praised The Force Awakens because they were paid by Walt Disney Studios or because they were pressured. There is a word in the English language that describes this situation. It's corruption. What's interesting is that Disney has been pressuring movie theaters into showing The Last Jedi in all the largest auditoriums when the film will be released. In other words, it seems that Disney wants to make as much money as possible in as little time as possible with the release of The Last Jedi. Make of this what you will. Possibly, The Last Jedi is a disappointing film, just like The Force Awakens. Therefore, Disney wants to make as much money as possible before negative reviews by honest film critics begin appearing on the internet. I'm sure that The Last Jedi will be showered with overwhelming praise by paid film critics upon release, just like the awful The Force Awakens was. I'm not saying that The Last Jedi will be just as bad as The Force Awakens. Rian Johnson probably managed to make a better film than The Force Awakens. But it's possible, maybe probable, that The Last Jedi will also turn out to be a disappointment and a cash grab.Anyway, let's get back to the original trilogy. I've got to say that I was rather impressed by these three films, especially by The Empire Strikes Back. The visuals impressed me the most. I don't really think of Star Wars as science fiction. This is why I didn't include Star Wars films on my list of the best science fiction films. For me, these films are more like space fantasy or science fantasy. But the visuals of space and spaceships in these films are some of the best ever put to film. George Lucas created quite an imaginative world in Star Wars. There is no doubt that Lucas is a visionary. But, of course, Lucas grew up at a time when Americans were brought up to be inventive, capable, and original. For the last several decades, however, Americans have been brought up not to be inventive and knowledgeable but to be uninventive and obedient. Such is the policy of the capitalist American ruling class. Therefore, Americans don't really invent anything anymore and they can't come up with original ideas. I've seen the original Star Wars trilogy four times, I think. Now that I'm no longer a teenager, I realize that these three films are quite impressive pieces of filmmaking. The special effects are particularly impressive. But Lucas and company were also smart enough to bring in experienced British actors in order to make certain scenes more meaningful. As it turns out, many of the novels in the Star Wars Expanded Universe are worth reading too. I'm now reading Heir To The Empire, Deceived, and Darth Plagueis. What I should mention is that I'm not hating the new Star Wars films because I'm just a hater. I'm not obsessed with Star Wars, and I've never been a fan, but I still wanted these films to be good. Unfortunately, they're not good. They contain propaganda, just like the original trilogy did, but they are unoriginal corporate cash grabs. On the other hand, The Empire Strikes Back is such a good film that I got an urge to watch it again after it was over."
22989,False,"In 1977, a cultural revolution began with the little-known science-fiction film called Star Wars created by visionary director George Lucas. It ended up being the highest-grossing film of all-time and it still ranks very high in the midst of today's blockbusters. It was a very enjoyable movie and it created memorable characters that will live on for eternity. So of course we would get a sequel. In fact, Lucas created a whole world around his baby -an ambition that was not normal in 1980. With the sequel-The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas handed the directorial duties to his former college film professor Irvin Kershner because of his duties with his rising visual effects company Industrial Light and Magic, but of course he was very involved with this film. But enough of the background, let's talk about this film. This sequel is much darker in tone, more mysterious, and quite frankly the best film in the franchise. Our favorite characters like Luke and Leia Skywalker and Han Solo are back and we are introduced to more characters that are stored away in our hearts forever such as Yoda and Lando Calrissian. This is also the movie where we have the famous battle and reveal between Luke and Darth Vaderor shall I say between father and son, but more on that later.After the Rebels blow up the Death Star at the end of A New Hope, they hide away in the icy planet of Hoth. But the rebel base is soon discovered by Darth Vader (James Earl Jones and David Prowse) and the empire. From the battle that ensues, our characters are separated. Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) flee across the galaxy from the Empire. They end up going into Cloud City where they come across an old friend of Han's- Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Meanwhile, Luke (Mark Hamill) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) are sent to the abandoned planet of Dagobath where he continues his Jedi training with an old Jedi master named Yoda (Frank Oz). But will they stay forgotten for long with Darth Vader relentlessly pursuing Luke across the galaxy? One of the biggest improvements over the original film is the visuals. While the visuals in the 1977 film were good for its time period, George Luca's new production company really improved upon the visuals. Along with the visuals, the film has strong production design and character design. I loved the look of Yoda, which was a puppet of course. You can tell the visuals were strong for a variety of reasons. There were the sights of the majestic Imperial Walkers during the battle of Hoth, the hairy sloth creature that attacks Luke after he gets lost on Hoth, the creepy, dense look of Dagobath, the spiral towers of Cloud City, and of course that lightsaber battle between Luke and Vader.SPOILER!! My highlight out of many of them is the revelation that happens near the end of the movie in Cloud City. I am sure most of you have seen the movie but if not, read no further. Darth Vader reveals to Luke during their intense duel that he is Luke's father, Anakin. Of course in the process, Vader chops of Luke's hand and he falls through a chute but is saved from falling to his death thanks to the Millennium Falcon. Also, the movie ends with Han Solo being captured by the Empire and frozen solid. So these events are just some of the reasons why this film is darker and more sinister than the space opera feel of the first film.The acting remains a strong point in the movie. Harrison Ford is excellent as always. I loved his ""wounded ego"" attitude and his bantering with Chewbacca added some lightheartedness to the movie. Yoda is my favorite new character. Not only did they want a realistic puppet, they actually wanted a good actor to bring that puppet to life. And Frank Oz did just that. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher remain excellent in their respective roles as Luke and Leia. And the voice of James Earl Jones? Well, the same magic that it always created! Need I say more? Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back is my favorite Star Wars movie, and frankly one of the best sci-fi films of all time. It really expanded upon the mystery and the lore the first film provided. The film explores its mythology in darker tones and that added depth and humanity to our characters. Lawrence Kasdan's and Leigh Brackett's screenplay took Lucas's world and created something that was evolutionary and breath-taking while staying true to its roots. The film ended on a sinister cliffhanger, so you bet we will be seeing a third film. The story and the visuals are fantastic, and now you can see why this is my favorite Star Wars film.My Grade: A+ ""No, I am your father!"" (Vader to Luke) ""Try not, Do, or do not!"" (Yoda to Luke)"
22990,False,"Anticipation...Star Wars Fans Waited Three Years for the Follow Up and were Not Disappointed.

22991,False,"Movie Review: ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980)On May 21st 1980, three years of the initial release of ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" (1977), comes this sequel, which beats the predecessor in every step of the way.Tension points between evolving character, conflicts and story twists are pitched down by writer Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett (1915-1978), who got involved early on to justify the success of Episode IV before parting for good into time.The screenplay turns out to be a masterpiece in cinematic story-telling. Then under the direction of directing veteran Irvin Kershner (1923-2010) Episode V flourishes into high class science fiction entertainment.The cast, led by Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher (1956-2016), who managed under the immense pressure due to the success of the predecessor to deliver charming, at times intense performances within their iconic characters of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia.The crew armed to the teeth with creativity, determination and hunger to show new technologies, serving the story with stop-motion creator work, camera motion control space battles and puppet master Frank Oz bringing the character of Yoda to live, who steals half the show as mentor to Luke Skywalker to harness his forceful powers.Gary Kurtz serves as second time around producer for Episode V after Episode IV before departing the franchise, so that George Lucas as Executive Producer made sure that he built the self-determining strings of self-marketing and license-owning for three decades to come until Lucasfilm Ltd. gets sold off to Disney Enterprises Inc. in October 2012.All these circumstances stand the facts that ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" is owned by the immense popularity of the character of Darth Vader accompanied by most popular piece of soundtrack composed by John Williams, who gives in to the dark side with its ringing march music in search for a sidekick to rule a galaxy in the character of Luke Sykwalker.The major confrontation between Vader vs. Sykwalker has been and always will be the center piece of George Lucas' Space Opera as to understand in its entity as one Magnus Rex of motion picture entertainment to enjoy and be enjoyed for generations to be and to come in order to indulge in a way of living, where thoughts provoke the actions in front of our eyes.The belief that one is the master of its own actions plus the interaction of humanized, speak flawed personalities to be brave-hearted, take and live with wrong decisions to make in all its consequence catapulting ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" into the league of the most important motion picture in history of cinema, where Zeitgeist under-dwelling mass effects get utilized to transcend messages of self-realization.© 2017 Felix Alexander Dausend (Cinemajesty Entertainments LLC)"
22992,False,"I absolutely Love this film. It is one of my most favorite Star wars episodes. I will always recommend this film to all my non starters fans and the fans. This movie is a great sic-fi based movie with lots of plot twists. The movie itself is great when it comes to people who love to sword fight and this can persuade lots when it comes to the ""Force"" and lots of role players love this movie because the story line is so good."
22993,False,"Best Star Wars flick ever. Obscure and intriguing, full of turning points and excellent directorial work by Irving Kershner, new exciting characters and marvelous editing. Also John Williams keeps up with a stupendous job and the depth of actor Mark Hamill gets better and better during the movie. Yoda is a an example of puppetry at its finest."
22994,False,"Back to summer 80, this was the 2nd movie our parents took us to watch on a big screen and the next day, i got fever because i had been so impressed by this scary bad robot guy ! But things get better soon because i became a avid player of Kenner SW toys and keep making stories with them up to 1987 In a way, this movie (like the 2 others) has imprint my imagination like no others : it was like i got new cells in my brain or 2 more eyes while this universe was as deep inside me as in a galaxy far away And remember, in the 80s, we didn't have the tapes, books, articles and digital things to go on : so the audience was really left alone with its memories ! Maybe it's because this movie has mythological stuff, or a Zen director (Kershner) or a incredible cast (Harrison, Mark & Carrie were the Harry, Ron and Hermione of our time) but at the end, it's a amazing space Odyssey from ice planet, to asteroids, to a swamp forest and a luminous city in the air ! Even today no movie can offer such exotic Scifi and that's why i got always a special vibration watching it, and in addition today, it's the special edition !Like Episode IV, the picture is superb with sharp colors ! The new Wampa left me cold while Cloud city is really beautiful : like my previous reviews, we can catch Lucas in deep lying as he sounds like he had all the details right from the start while he found them all along the way ! Also done last time, the radical hero (Luke) goes on with his brainwashing : On Dagobah, he enrolls in a school to forget all the things he learns so far and accepts the only truth ! For sure, his own feelings are forbidden and he must obey the master ! This Decider article is really twisted but it would be great to hear Lucas comment on this lecture because it seems that SW fans support indeed a sort of fundamentalism against official law..."
22995,False,This was an excellent movie within the Star Wars franchise. Each actor gave their own interpretation towards their chosen character and the way the story line fits in with the previous film was amazing. Each scene drew me in and it portrayed the characters well in the franchise. one of the best scenes was Luke and the rest of the resistance working together to destroy Vader and the Death Star.
22996,False,"What can i say about this MONSTER? Nothing, of course.. all people made best reviews. T his movie is a living entity, all people love this SAGA, me included.I hope, never die this tittle with the company who write the newest histories.Don't forget see the movie A NEW HOPE, is the first of the SAGA."
22997,False,"As argued by Dante and Randal in Kevin Smith's slacker classic Clerks, the question of whether A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back is the better movie is one of cinema's most popular debates. Episode IV's introduction to George Lucas' world of aliens, droids and intergalactic war struck a chord with audiences back in 1977, and continues to do so today. It is a fun good vs. evil story that only touches upon the spiritual elements of the 'Force' that we now know so well, and on the vastness of the universe it is set within. Personally, I have to agree with Dante's argument that Empire offers a darker and richer experience, which not only develops the series' mythology even further, but paints its characters with far more layers than seen before.We no doubt have George Lucas' lack of involvement in the film's development for that, as the witty script by Leigh Bracket and Raiders of the Lost Ark scribe Lawrence Kasdan keeps the action both exciting and with consequence, as well as maintaining a firm grasp on the characters' complicated relationships and personal roles in the expanding story. Director Irvin Kershner, who took over after Lucas bailed following a troubled pre-production, also brings the best out of the actors. Empire really transformed what was an interesting idea drawing inspiration from classic sci-fi serials and the samurai films of Akira Kurosawa into the billion-dollar beast it is today. These films are now so deeply rooted in our culture that it's almost difficult to classify the original trilogy as mere movies, they have now become something else entirely.After succeeding in blowing up the Empire's planet-destroying Death Star, the Rebels, led by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), are hiding out on ice planet Hoth while the evil Darth Vader sends out trackers throughout the galaxy in the hope of tracking them down. Smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) wants to repair his ship and get back to his old ways with trusted Wookiee friend Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), but that doesn't prevent him from flirting with Leia (Carrie Fisher). When they are eventually spotted and the planet is attacked, the film does what most sequels do nowadays and splits everybody up. Han and Leia must escape through an asteroid field with the Empire in pursuit to seek refuge in Cloud City with old friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), while Luke seeks out Dagobah to learn the ways of the Force from Jedi master Yoda (Frank Oz).Even though I have seen this movie countless times, the arm hairs still stand up when John Williams' fantastic score kicks in during the opening crawl. From the on, Empire delivers a relentless assault of riveting set-pieces and iconic moments, from the attack on Hoth which still stands up to most modern blockbusters, to the gob- smacking twist at the climax now so routinely, and lovingly, spoofed. It also takes Darth Vader to a new level of villainy, as the helmeted Sith lord relentlessly pursues the young man he feels is strong in the ways of the Force, and brutally takes out any of his own underlings who make the mistake of failing him. It's certainly dark, but it's easy to forget just how exciting and engrossing it is also. Ending at an incredibly low point for most of the good guys involved with only a sliver of hope on the horizon, I can't imagine how much fans were left wanting more back in 1980 as the credits rolled. It will always be superior to A New Hope in my book, but you can't have one without the other, and both are damn near perfect."
22998,False,"The Prequels? All terrible. Jedi? Okay. Force Awakens? Good. A New Hope? Better. Empire? Best. Without his leash being held like by Tarkin in A New Hope or by the Emperor in Return of the Jedi, Vader unleashes his fury upon the Rebellion (and, unfortunately, a few unfortunate Imperial officers...), showing how massively threatening the Empire still is even after the setback in the last film. The twist it includes was incredibly shocking for moviegoers of the time. Irvin Kershner's visionary character development took the film in a different direction from the technical spectacle that Lucas presented in the previous film. The inner struggles of the characters are greatly manifested, especially during Yoda's passage of knowledge to Luke, Luke's suspenseful duel with Vader, Leia's relationship with Han, and Lando's moral struggle. The Empire Strikes Back's simplicity combined with the infinite wisdom it conveys truly makes it the best installment of the Star Wars saga as well as one of the best films of all time."
22999,False,"This was truly and game changing film in the history of cinema. The entire Star Wars is iconic in American culture but Empire Strikes back and the benchmark of all the films. Great writing, great direction, and possibly the strongest performances by the cast, it was an amazing film with an ending that changed the standard of ""twist"" endings."
23000,False,"When the original Star Wars movies came out around 30 years ago, they opened the eyes of many generations to come. There was nothing around to match the futuristic insight and it blew the minds of many. One of the most important factors was that George Lucus had studied over fifty religions world wide to get an understanding of the Force. In the early movies they really focused on this point. I hope that the future films really focus on this point more as i believe it is the most integral part of the films."
23001,False,"This is the turning point in the Original Trilogy films, more character development rather than action.Don't know how long after the Death Star's destruction that the Rebels take refuge on Hoth The movie has a more subdued storyline unlike the first film, more character driven this time. The excitement takes a backseat.There are character driven motives and with a semi climatic end .Empire is the third best in the original trilogy read somewhere that thereWere holes or something can't Remer which , but still a favorite in the ot"
23002,False,"This is one of my favorite films. It is a great mix of action, drama, and adventure. I would suggest that when watching this film, to watch the Theatrical version first because the special effects can be too distracting. It is the darker film of the trilogy, but still fine for the family."
23003,False,"In terms of action and adventure, ""Empire Strikes Back"" is a rousing success. There are enough space flights, phaser blasts, and lightsaber wielding to satisfy the visual effects junkies. The only thing missing, however, is that ""sense of something epic"" inherent in its original predecessor.In ""Episode V"", as it has come to be known, the rebels are still being pursued by the Empire, this time on the ice planet Hot. The first half of the film focuses on those battles, primarily featuring Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). A new character in Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) is also introduced, though his loyalties are very much in question. The second half deals more with Luke Skywalker's (Mark Hamill) beginning steps to becoming a Jedi. After the death (in Part IV) of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke goes to continue his training with Yoda, an enigmatic little green character seemingly older than time itself. The film's climax brings forth the long-awaited meeting of Luke and Darth Vader (voice of James Earl Jones), as well as a startling (if now clichéd) revelation that sets the stage for the final chapter.Though a good movie in its own right, I always felt as if this one lagged behind the original in certain key areas. A recent watching confirmed this. I think the ""trouble"" stems from the fact that ""Empire"" is much more of an action film than a drama. Whereas ""New Hope"" was so incredibly genre-diverse, ""Empire"" takes that same cast of characters and instead relies a bit too much on laser blasts and space maneuvers. It doesn't help that certain scenes (inside the ""asteroid""; Lando's scenes) just feel a little draggy...like filler.Overall, though, this is still a very watchable film that keeps the main storyline pushing forward. For special effects or action/adventure buffs, this one will stand out. For others, it may fall just a tick behind the original."
23004,False,"It's often said that The Empire Strikes Back is the greatest Star Wars film simply because it's dark. You've heard it before, people telling you it's the best because ""the ending is so dark"". While I do think this is the best film out of the series, I don't agree with that reason. I think the movie is dark as the result of what actually makes the movie so great. I will attempt to explain my point of view.In A New Hope our heroes were part of a story that was bigger then them. It was about the Empire trying to wipe out the Rebel Alliance. In contrast the story of Empire Strikes Back is driven by the characters. The Rebels are still trying to free the universe from the Empire, it's just not the main story anymore. It's the backdrop of the story. The real story is Darth Vader's obsession with turning Luke Skywalker to the Dark Side. That is the driving force behind everything that happens in this film and suddenly the story is much more personal for our heroes.This of course ends up giving a fantastic character arc for Luke, something that was missing from Episode IV. The heroic and hopeful Skywalker gets put through the wringer and by the end of the movie everything he believes in is now in question. It also leads up to one of the most memorable twists in movie history (which brings into question what order you should be watching these films).Not to be left out though, and maybe something that goes overlooked by some, but Leia and Han have great character arcs as well. The incredibly self-reliant Princess is left emotionally vulnerable while Solo goes from self-serving to selfless. It's done so well you won't notice until it's too late. Of course this also leads up to one of the most memorable cliffhangers in movie history.Character driven story. Great character arcs. One of the greatest twists and cliffhangers in movie history. Some truly iconic film moments. Those are the reasons why Empire Strikes Back is such a great film. The end result of those things make the film dark."
23005,False,This movie is amazing. Its practical effect and visual effects still holds up today the story is amazing I will not go into it to avoid spoilers but this film definitely takes on a darker tone then then a new hope and return of the Jedi this is one of the best movies ever made and by far the best star wars movie. With twits and turns all around this movie is definitely worth a watch. If you haven't seen any of the star wars movies I would recommend watching them in release order as it saves some information that is spoiled in the prequels. Also watching the prequels is not necessary as it ruins some concepts that were prominent in the original trilogy
23006,False,"I remember watching a Star Wars documentary called Empire of Dreams which is about how the first trilogy came to life and his tremendous success which is still going on today. During one of the many interviews George Lucas gave for this doc, he remembered the huge deal of pressure he had to bear on his shoulders while filming Empire Strikes back.He produced it with his own money he earned thanks to the huge success of the first movie as he wanted to keep his independence from the big studios. The fans had also a lot of expectations about the upcoming movie so George Lucas wanted it the same level if not better than A new hope. And it is.While a new hope was focused on this small band of young people and their struggle to destroy a devastating weapon of mass destruction, Lucas has dedicated this movie into developing each one of the characters as well as the relationship between them with its lot of surprises. That famous scene when Luke learns the terrible truth about his father's fate is one of them and to me this is the knockout moment of Empire.The other big novelty is this romance between Han and Leia. It's a great addition to the story line which allows us to discover another entirely hidden side of both of them. It's fun and sweet to see them teasing at each other. It adds some lightness too in a very dark plot.We are also introduced to three main new characters who are part of the Star Wars Legacy: Yoda, The Emperor and Lando Calrisian. There's no need to introduce Yoda, the cunning and wise Jedi master, who is maybe small by this height but awesomely powerful with the Force. In the first movie, Obi-Wan introduced us to this powerful invisible superpower but Yoda is the one who tells everything about it while we follow Luke in his Jedi Training. He shows us the true meaning of the Force. This was what made this character so important to the general story. About the Emperor, even if we don't see much of him in Empire, we understand that he's the main villain of the story and that in fact Darth Vader is one of his victims.Of course we still see a lot of epic combat scenes like the Battle of Hoth with those imperial walkers advancing towards the rebel base, the pursuit in the asteroid field or of course the duel on Bespin between Luke and Vader which climaxed with the surprising revelation of Darth Vader to his son.All of those made this movie incredibly awesome. To me Empire Strikes back is the best episode of the entire saga and it's not surprising that so many are seeing it as the movie to compare each time a new star wars movie is released."
23007,False,"I remember watching Episode V in the theater back in 1980/81 and i walked out with an uncomfortable feeling that this was just a moneymaking episode and simply not finished. In fact it wasn't, since it was designed to be the dramatic middle-part of the trilogy, which i did not know at the time - i was 14 and had no idea about the trilogy.If there would not be an episode VI this would indeed be a major downside of episode V, but as the center part of the trilogy it was the best possible movie. In fact the plot does not really feel that epic, it just develops the characters more and prepares for the final act of episode VI.Now, more than 36 years later we do have two completed trilogies and a new one just started plus a prequel to episode IV and all those movies can be judged from a wider angle and perspective. Having said that, this one is still one of the best, although not the most enjoyable, which i think is episode VI. But all three original movies are very close and from a cinematic point of view TESB stands out, since it has the most perfect balance between all the aspects that makes STAR WARS great. Any other episode has its flaws and issues, but episode V is almost complete in all ways.In addition to this it simply downgrades the prequel episodes 1-3 to just being a lousy effort, but although Lucas tried to create something unique they totally fail in terms of being a serious contender to the original trilogy. Almost everything is either over sized or flat, and especially that is the complete opposite of episode V. It's technically advanced, serious, funny, full of ideas and action and has a straight plot. Something very rare these days."
23008,False,"With the new Star Wars, Rogue One, being released, I saw the SW trilogy on TNT and caught TESB for the first time in over a decade. The ambition, imaginative universe, and score combine for an amazing experience even 36 years later. The Sci fi elements still hold up, as they were ahead of their time, and the philosophical components are timeless. In fact, this is what sets it apart, along with the great drama and twists no one who hasn't seen it would ever see coming. The magnitude of the stakes, philosophy, and drama fill the movie with much more seriousness than just an action flick. Combine these elements with a little outdated special effects, though still impressive and mostly holding up, that were clearly impressive for its time, incredible performances, and a very clever construction of the world of this far away galaxy, including turning robots and beasts into major characters, and you have yourself a classic."
23009,False,"I actually thought ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was the best movie made in the original Star Wars trilogy, even better than the first Star Wars movie.I will admit, the trip that Luke had to be trained as a Jedi by Yoda has some entertaining moments in it, but I also call this the somewhat slow portion of the movie.Just like what they did with the original ""Star Wars"" movie, the ""Special Edition"" remake of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" that they made in the 90's wasn't done well, they did do less to alter this story, but they still had a few bad CGI effects added that did nothing more than mess-up original scenes in the movie.The original story itself is really good. First with their fights with the empire in the snow, then with Han Solo's emergency trip out with Princess Leia on the Millennium Falcon, plus the group's fights against the empire. Then when their trip to get Lando Calrissian's help fails by the empire's quick interference."
23010,False,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" does its best to visually surpass the original ""Star Wars"" and the special effects or the creatures' designs are as convincing as the pioneering space epic, there's also a richness of landscapes, taking you from the snowy summits of a cold planet to the tropical jungle, but beyond the escapism, it's the excitement to see again that iconic gallery of characters, Han Solo, Leia, C3PO, R2-D2, Luke, Chewbacca (whose mourning and moaning sounds took a whole other resonance) and a few newcomers. In ""The Empire Strikes Back"", the key word is ""Back"". Now, take the most hardcore ""Star Wars"" fan -I think there's a name for them, and I guess I would know if I were one- and take someone who doesn't care much about the series, now, ask the pair to list four or five classic ""Star Wars"" moments, I bet a good half of the scenes will belong to the glorious episode V ""The Empire Strikes Back"", directed by Irvin Keshner (and George Lucas as the Executive Producer). By the way, do you know the joke, why did Lucas start ""Star Wars"" with the 4th, 5th and 6th episodes and then made the first three? Because Master Yoda directed them (punch line drum sound). Well, that's just to show you I didn't use the word 'sequel', and this is not because I don't want to offend sensitivities, but because I don't take the film as a sequel but as the real journey into the soul of ""Star Wars"", the dark side, literally.It is in this film that the relationship between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) transcends the limits of the simple crush, the interactions between them are really catching and you can tell that Harrison Ford challenges his character, and has fun teasing the little Princess who's not insensitive to his charm. A film where actors have fun playing their characters can't turn bad, and it is a credit to the directing for having made the romance efficient with no more than three or four scenes. And they all culminate with one of the most touching declarations of love, touching because of its laconic but sincere answer you know. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is also the film that pursues the coming-of-age of Luke Skywalker and features his initiation by Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz). Obi-Wan was a great character but Yoda has everything, the speech mannerism, the mimics and this little quality that makes him like the perfect crossover between Mr. Myagi and ""E.T."" except that he came the first. Yoda is the heart of the story, and when he warns Luke about the dark side of the Force, he knows exactly where he's heading to, and I guess ever since ""Star Wars"" ended, the audience knew what the next film had to deliver. Which leads to the one true reason-to-be of the film, the climactic light-saber battle between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker right after having plunged us into the evil Empire Lord's psyche and revealed the Shakespearian truth about his identity. Now, is it really a spoiler to spoil it or is it a of prescription case? In a Simpson episode from the third season, which means 1992, a gag consisted on Homer leaving the theater and spoiling the ending to all the lining up moviegoers. So after one decade, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was already part of cinema's history. I guess you can't call yourself a movie lover but if you don't know Vito Corleone, Scarlett O'Hara or the father of Luke Skywalker, well it kind of shades off to ignorance. Indeed, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is like the second tome of Homer's Odyssey, it is an inevitable and valuable portion of Cinema's history regarding perhaps the one true myth that solely belongs to the silver screen. And it is for this achievement that it's impossible not to recognize the cinematic value of ""The Empire Strikes Back"". Say what you want about the creatures, the special effects, the little gimmick or childish moments, but when the film starts and you have in order, the 'Fox' logo, the 'long time go' title card-and then the first pumping sound of the triumphant fanfare, something melts inside you and you're like a child who just sat on the roller- coaster. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was the most anticipated movie, the follow-up to the all time most popular film and it managed to become more popular by injecting novelty within the relationships and add new characters such as Yoda or Lando (Billy Dee Williams). It even managed to equal the original by having its own score: ""The Imperial March"", as if it had to have its own existence independently from the first, and it's fitting that the score is about the villain as Darth Vader seems more majestic and frightening in this opus, actually he was nominated #3 in the AFI's Top 50 villains but it was the Darth Vader from ""Empire"", the one with the Imperial March. Even Vader raises its iconic status with his (temporary) victory over the rebels. Because that's also what characterizes the film, the bad guys have the upper hand. It concludes with a frozen Han Solo, an amputated Luke with the painful knowledge about his origins, a disintegrated C3PO and so on a cliffhanger so obvious it doesn't even need the obligatory ""to be continued"", we know the fight between evil and good isn't over. I guess at that moment, ""The Return of the Jedi"" immediately became the most anticipated cinematic project."
23011,False,"I'm continuing to watch all the Star Wars movies in preparation for ""The Force Awakens"". I've made it up to ""Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"". This is the one that I always think I'm going to love, and then don't. Maybe that's because I think things are going to happen in it that actually evidently happen in ""Return of the Jedi"" (Palpatine makes no appearance in ""Empire"", despite his being...the Emperor). Maybe it's because I find Yoda to be less endearing in this movie than I did when I was five years old. Who knows.Whatever the case, I'm giving ""Empire"" 7/10 stars. Yes, it does continue on the story of ""A New Hope"" relatively seamlessly. Yes, the characters are iconic, and yes it is a fun movie overall. Yes, Luke and Vader have a memorable showdown with a memorable line. But it just wasn't as enjoyable for me as ""A New Hope"". The story seemed to bend and sway a bit (Luke's visit to Dagobah, for example. The dream sequence encounter with Vader also is a little weak).A long story short, I like this movie, but not enough to give it an 8 or above. Good movie. Fun. But not one of my faves."
23012,False,"In 1980 I was 8 years old... I still have vague memories of standing outside the movie theater waiting to get in to the (then) new film. I was so excited I could hardly stand still. Once inside the theater I saw what was to become my favorite movie in the Star Wars Saga! The plot thickens in this sci-fi saga as we learn more about the young Luke Skywalker and the vile Darth Vader as well a budding romance between Leia Organa and Han Solo. The movie also revels a little more about Han Solo's past with the introduction of new characters Lando Calrissian, Lobot and the Bounty Hunters (in particular Boba Fett). We are also introduced to the wise Jedi master Yoda.I will not say more due to the fact I do not want to spoil the film for any first time viewers. All I can say it find a copy, watch and enjoy one of the most exciting and historical science fiction films ever made.10/10"
23013,False,"Back in 1977 I really enjoyed the first film in the franchise, but the hype was so enormous when this came out I decided to avoid it for a bit. I finally caught up with it in 1997 by which time Time had sadly caught up with it too and wreaked its usual damage. Then it was a case of Roll Over Harryhausen, tell Jim Henson the news.Story has imaginative intergalactic politics and battles amidst a plethora of gormless soap and stereotypes. To a kid it would be marvellous stuff to watch and as an adult to revel in through rose-tinted glasses, but coming at it as an adult I see it through the Empire's, sorry, Emperor's New Clothes and in the Altogether. It's relentlessly inventive but not in my top 1000 films of all time. Favourite bits: Luke yakking to Kermit about the Force; the flying city where expense or common sense is no object; the love affair between the Princess and the Scoundrel; the remarkably obvious pay-off, hyped at the time as something groundbreaking.The first cut is nearly always the deepest - long live the brash first film, this sequel is entertaining and nonsensical, an eminent time-passer. The first was a monument to Luck, the second a monument to Hype; I love fantasy movies of all eras and genres but mainly those not surrounded by heaps of hype swallowed by millions of people, it's a real barrier to my complete enjoyment of anything. This is a watchable movie but only a must-watch movie to see for what digital cgi cartoonery has done to the movies, and to us. Modern cgi is usually cold and soulless but usually not jerky and laughable, cgi has spoilt us all and there's no going back. However, now to watch Jason & The Argonauts and curse Roger Rabbit."
23014,False,"Now I must say there are other films that come close but the Empire Strikes Back is my favourite and the best movie I have ever seen. This film has everything a sequel should do the same fantastic performances as the first, the stakes raised and also added struggles and revelations for the characters. The 2nd film in the star wars franchise kicks off a few months after the original with the Empire and Darth Vader tracking the rebels and eventually finding them from there Luke goes to Dagobah to learn from Jedi master Yoda while Han, Leia, Chewbacca and C-3PO attempt to avoid the empire. This film takes the bold move of splitting the characters up to two stories providing more substance to this film than the previous film even though that is great too. This film is truly when Darth Vader comes into the forefront he is now in full charge of the imperial forces and is awesome and evil at the same time. This film has exciting action, heartfelt moments and one heck of a tense climax with possibly the biggest revelation in film industry. If you haven't seen the original you will be lost at the beginning but what are you doing if you haven't seen the original star wars. Go watch them now!"
23015,False,"I was 13 years old, 3 years have passed since Episode IV The New Hope. After initial scare, I have recovered. I was explained that it is all make belief, and Darth Vader was not going to come and eat me for breakfast. I started expecting Episode V with great eagerness. What was it all going to be about? In our little Star Wars club in Sarajevo we obtained information that Episodes I, II and III will be made in a long distance future, and we obtained some short synopsis of what they were all going to be.After Episode V finally came out, we came to the cinema Dubrovnik and made a party while watching it. It was my first great teen excitement. After watching the film we talked at length about all of it and what we liked and did not like. I told my gang that I was sorry that the Empire did not catch all of the rebels and did away with them. Everybody looked at me with amazement. Why was I for the Dark Side? I do not know, they were just so sexy! So dark and total. To remind you we still lived in the what-was-left of Tito*s Yugoslavia and we had totalitarian minds. I wanted it to be all livada (use google translator)! Peace in the galaxy, for ever! Others were for the rebels, they were after all good kids of Tito*s partisans, antifascists! Later I went with them. I saw the light, rebels were the good guys, I guess.All in all as the good clone army we went the next day and watched the movie again. And again. And again. Numerous more times.That how it was long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away..."
23016,False,"The Empire Strikes Back is one of the all time classic movies that everyone should see.Obviously you must watch the Star Wars Trilogy (and I am of course referring to the original Star Wars Trilogy since we are talking about Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back right here) in order to fully appreciate how great the movies are and to understand that story that is going in on this movie, which is the second installment of the franchise. (It was called Episode V to indicate that there would be a prequel trilogy, with the original Star Wars later re-released as ""Episode IV"" of the series.)I was not a big fan of the prequel trilogy but the original movies all stack up nicely even to this day. Though dated the effects are still nice and the original releases have awesome models and puppetry that frankly are better than the CGI employed in the various re-issues. Check it out!"
23017,False,"When it comes to sequels, I strongly believe that everyone gets an empty feeling in their stomach. There can always be a misfire when it comes to the next chapter of a saga, and this one was one of those films that worried many, many fans. At the same time, however, it was very anticipated. ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"" ranks as my second favorite ""Star Wars"" film, following closely behind ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"". Most fans would disagree with my arrangement of favorites, yet I don't believe any would disagree with this film getting an outrageous score. That's right. ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"" is--simply put--phenomenal. Everything from the scale of the film to the sets to the acting to the writing has improved from the original film.The rebel alliance, at the beginning of this film, are relocated in an icy planet called Hoth. As they wait for Luke to return from his scouting, Han Solo goes on the rescue to save Luke, whom was captured and nearly eaten by a polar bear-like monstrosity. After they return to the rebel base, the Empire locates the rebels with a droid sent to Hoth, and then they invade the area, attempting to find Luke Skywalker and his friends. The base is destroyed, but now Luke must go to Dagoba, in search for Jedi Master Yoda so that he may begin his Jedi training.Once again, Mark Hammill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher (along with every single actor from the original film) make a return for this enormously exciting sequel. However, their performances have taken a huge step upward, crafting one of the best character-based films ever created. This time around, you can practically cut the tension in the air with a lightsaber because of these stupendous performances. It seems like every actor became one with their character even moreso than in the original phenomenon.Another huge step forward was the writing. George Lucas may have created the prequel films in later years, but there is no denying that his writing was extravagant in this particular film. ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"" has a deep message along with a--what I consider, at least--better storyline, along with better character arcs. Lucas outdid himself with this screenplay. This film also included one of the most shocking plot twists in film history, and it changed ""Star Wars"" fans forever. This particular scene also became the most quoted line in cinema history, seeing as how revolutionary it had become.One more surprise with this film is that the special effects have gotten ten times better than the original. Everything about this film is perfect, to a tee, when it comes to the special effects. We even get a real lightsaber fight this time around, clocking in at about fifteen minutes long. I wasn't near being born when this film came out, but everyone tells me that this lightsaber battle was so intense that they couldn't control themselves at the the theatres. Even the space scenes look real. The detailing of the scale models used for spaceships were extensive and edgy.""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"" is just too perfect. The film was way beyond its time of release, and that is an absolute mouthful.My rating for ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a complete, well-deserved ten-out-of-ten stars.I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.May the force be with you! God bless, and Merry Christmas!"
23018,False,"This is my favorite out of the original Star Wars movies, and for good reason. There's action, there's drama, and there's Yoda (because who doesn't love the little green guy?). Not to mention the fact that Harrison Ford is in it, and he's a brilliant actor. Mark Hamill does a great job playing Luke Skywalker, and Carrie Fischer is a convincing Leia as well. I'm personally not a fan of Lando, but he's not terrible. The special effects aren't perfect, but it IS an older movie, so it's forgivable. Lightsabers: I really wish they were real. Also, it shouldn't be a surprise to know, but the stormtroopers still can't hit anything. I love all six of the movies, but this one is truly spectacular."
23019,False,"The best Star wars movie ever! Great story, Great acting and Great action. Even the music in this film was amazing. Usually when a great film comes out the sequel sucks. Not in this case. The Empire Strikes Back did not follow the crappy sequel line. The reason it might be so good is because George Lucas did not direct it. The only problem I have is the ending. Why is Lando Wearing Hans clothes? does Han have a closet full of the same clothes that fit Lando? who knows... The Empire Strikes back is a film that you can watch over and over and never get bored. I have seen this film over 100 times and I still love watching it."
23020,False,"Yes! That is it! It was my first VHS movie since 1990''s, I can remember that very well! What can I say? It's nothing! It's super-action science- fiction film for that year and still popular through many fans and collectors! George Lucas started his saga so many years ago...., but the time is infinite for him! He creates something creative, something brilliant, something wonderful, that I cant explain in full words! The saga will be sound again, again and again in our ears, in our hearts and in our mind forever! I just would like to say one important thing! To wish THE BEST REGARDS from us to this ""favourite master"" of his own ""genre""!!!!! The SAGA will be with us Always!"
23021,False,"It was an incredible movie and probably one of the best in the series. I would not mind seeing it again, Star Wars Episode V was one of the most ingenious movies I have ever seen. I can't wait to see any future ones. George Lucas is a real genius of Sci Fi movies. I wonder what might be in store for the future. We will just need to see. Also Chewie is really funny and this is a great film. I wonder what new threat will arise. Star wars Forever Amen. I also wonder what new planets our heroes will visit. I bet the droids will be even funnier. Disney will hopefully make Star Wars even better. Also I think Princess Leia will be even more beautiful in the future movies."
23022,False,"After the huge success of ""Star Wars"" both critical and in the box office, giving birth to a new era cinema. George Lucas was already planning its sequel, but decided to divide his work with the director Irvin Kershner and screenwriters Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett, many fans were afraid (even with Lucas writing the story), but this group brought the saga to a all-new and unexplored level.""Empire"" begins shortly after the huge events of its predecessor with the entire rebel army after destroying the "" Death Star"", fleeing through galaxy with the powerful imperial fleet right behind them with ruthless Darth Vader (David Prowse) in command. And with the rebels we see Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) finally realizing his dream of becoming a pilot in the rebel army against the empire, and alongside him his ""inseparable"" friends: the brave and cocky (and Badass) Han Solo (Harrison Ford); the brave and intelligent Leia (Carrie Fisher); the.....Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew); R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels). But their lives begin to suffer a great risk when the Empire finds the rebel position in the ice world of Hoth, where a huge battle starts forcing the rebels to retreat. Han, Leia, Chewbacca and C - 3PO manage to escape in the Millennium Falcon, but end up being captured later by Darth Vader thanks to a betrayal of Han's friend, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Meanwhile, Luke and R2 were able to escape as well, but with the voice instruction from Obi - Wan (Alec Guinness), Luke is advised to go to the Dagobah system and meet the Jedi master Yoda (Frank Oz) which will help Luke know and control the ""strength"", which later will bring him sinister secrets and the sacrifice for his friends.At the time it came-out, the film was poorly received by critics and fans, but perhaps understandable. No one at the time expected to see a major change in direction that the director and writers, hell, even the Lucas led to film and its history, and today the film is considered not only the best Star Wars ever made, but also one of the best sequel of a saga in the cinema.If Lucas in the 1st film had already revolutionized the modern cinema, so here he and his team raised barriers never explored. While the 1st movie had the great adventure of Luke going to rescue the princess from evil forces in a massive sci-fi style full of humor and thrilling moments. In this one he maintain the great sense of adventure and the humor is not lacking thanks to Han, but here everything is brought to a much more human side thanks to its unforgettable characters. And also thanks to the writers who deliver an amazing and beautiful narrative to the characters since small to big dialogues between the characters showing their human side, and also further exploring the ""Jedi"" topic that it wasn't been well explored in the 1st movie. But also the other side where the film is taken is into a very dark twist that began when dark secrets from the past begin to appear.A flawless script and characters very well evolved, but also at the technical aspects the film rises completely. From the incredible visual effects with a beautiful visual direction from Kershner. And also the new and memorable soundtrack from John Williams ""The Imperial March"", you know, that dan dan dan dan dandan dan dandan, dan dan dan dan dandan dan dandan (I know, it's strange to describe a song writing and not listening, well anyway)?! Not only the best ""Star Wars"" or the best sequel ever made, but also one of the best movies ever made will be marked forever in the history of cinema. All thanks to a flawless script, beautiful direction, strong performances (especially Mark Hamill with an incredible evolution of acting) and the biggest twist that cinema ever had makes ""Empire Strikes Back"" an eternal masterpiece! 10/10"
23023,False,"The movie is completely an excellent work of art.I love this movie as it has a very close place in my heart.No,I have not seen this movie a hundred times just like the person next door,I have only seen this brilliant masterpiece a merely 3 times,I was not born n the 90s and definitely did not see it when it was first launched as I was born in 2001.It has only been a half a year since I saw this movie and I was just so sad on the fact that I was not born earlier.Although the storyline may seem a little bit not as good as the earlier one (Ep.4 A New Hope) but it lived up to its hype,and then some(believe me,that some is a lot.).Extremely brilliant,The Imperial March is my cellphone's ring-tone now,although it gets a little weird sometimes.Frank Oz as Yoda is amazing.The entire cast is brilliant,this is my favorite movie of the entire franchise.Now All we can do is re-watch these movies and just wait for the next sequel trilogy (containing ep.7,8 and 9.)and see how Star Wars results when it is put under direction by Disney and passed on to the next generation(which is supposed to be mine ?) under J.J Abrams. May the Force be with you!"
23024,False,"This by far is my favorite movie of all time. Of Course I saw the original Star Wars when it first came out in theaters in 1977 which blew my mind and took me on the adventure of a lifetime. But Empire is the best of the three original films. It's ability to connect the characters in a more personal way and to reveal how deeply each character affects the progression of the story.Each scene and sequence moves the viewer closer and closer to a pivotal point where the characters are also paired as an influential unit relevant to a particular plot. Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, Princess Lea and Han Solo, which interconnect with the other pairs Han Solo/Luke Skywalker and Vader/Lea. The flow of dialog from these characters help create a malleable cohesion as to help support the type of character in which they each portray; hero, villain, damsel in distress and rouge smuggler.Besides all that this space and time adventure brought the audience into the story and helped create a new mythical journey. I have since watched this movie hundreds of times over the years, will always be the one movie that influence my imagination and will continue to watch it even more."
23025,False,"Episode V is the finest entry of the first two trilogies, since it is the best written(really strong dialogue, situations, and realistic evolution of the returning characters) phenomenal direction by Irvin Kirshner(exciting and breathless, always something going on of interest) and equally spectacular F/X, which still hold up(did not need much tweaking for the Special Editions) Story has the Empire striking back(of course!) against the rebellion(despite the loss of the Death Star) and our heroes'(Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher returning as Luke, Han, and Leia) attempts to survive and enact their next plan of attack, only to become captured by an unwitting betrayal of old friend Lando(Billy Dee Williams, quite smooth but appealing). Climactic battle between Luke and Darth Vader is legendary, and breathtaking. Cliffhanger ending sets up the next chapter nicely.A classic."
23026,False,"I remember going to the movie theater to watch the premiere of Star Wars... This experience totally blew my mind!!! I had never experienced anything quite as powerful before. I felt like similar adventures may actually be happening in other galaxies, far, far away and we think we are alone on our little planet... I obviously ran to the theater one more time as soon as The Empire Strikes Back hit the silver screen. Then that was it. From the first images, I was like in command of a Snowspeeder! This visuals were simply mesmerizing, should I say Striking! From this day, I knew I wanted to be part of something like that... one day. I am not there yet, but I am now a CG artist, working very hard at perfecting my art, looking at every detail that can make each of my model more realistic, more believable. I am also writing and producing a sci-fi movie: Apostone 'resurrection'. A mix of CG animation and acting. I am realizing my dream since I met Star Wars the sandman."
23027,False,"Well I have to say that I am a fan of the old and classic movies of the cinema and not the new ones. Star Wars is not just a movie, is the beginning of a new era, it's the beginning and the peak of movies with space and its defense.When I saw the ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" I was really amazed not because of the graphics of this movie but because that was something different, something that it's a landmark of the cinema and for all the people.It's a movie with which comes the end of this trilogy. With this movie comes the end of the adventures, the agony and the expectation of what it's going to happen. In this movie everything ends with only one winner and who is going to be? Luke Skywalker or the Dark Lord? If you want to now the end of this movie you have to see it..."
23028,False,"Star Wars the Empire Strikes Back is not only the greatest film of the original three, but the greatest film in history. It contains the perfect combination of great story telling and spectacles that blew the minds of its time and continues to do this years after it first released. The film thrusts into a darker more serious premise than that of the previous one. Though the film is considerably darker it still has the great mythology, excitement and adventure of the first one. The film is full of outstanding moments that have won their place in movie history. What sets this film aside from others is its not-commonly seen ending. The film ends on a high and unusual note that leaves one wanting more. This film has and will continue standing the test of time for many years to come."
23029,False,"Star Wars: Episode V- The Empire Strikes Back is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. It's an impressive sequel that manages to surpass the expectations of its predecessor, this is the standards that every film maker should aim towards when considering a sequel, the first one is fun and introduces the characters in a light hearted manner, but this one further develops them and their universe in a much darker tone. It's definitely the bleakest film in the series, showing the main characters succeed the least, and even the ending isn't particularly joyous, let's just say the title suits the overall tone of the movie perfectly. The cast are still in great form here, in fact several of them have improved between the three year gap of the first movie, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher have certainly improved as actors and, overall, they seem much more comfortable in their roles. We are also introduced to some great new characters in this film, such as Lando and Boba Fett, but the one who stands out the most for me is Yoda, one of my favourite characters of the franchise, Frank Oz perfectly portrays the wise and woeful personality of this master Jedi. There are so many noteworthy moments here, whether it be the wise words from Yoda, the battle between Vader and Luke or Han's farewell to Leia, every scene makes me smile, it's a piece of film history that will be remembered for years to come. Terrific performances, a thrilling storyline and special effects that still hold up today, fans of Star Wars and sci-fi in general will not be disappointed by Star Wars: Episode V- The Empire Strikes Back, I would recommend it to all moviegoers. Luke must complete his Jedi training with Master Yoda while the Empire has returned after the destruction of the Death Star, with Vader's only intention now being to find Luke.Best Performance: Harrison Ford"
23030,False,"A fun movie to watch when you're bored or just want to have a Star Wars marathon! It's really cool because my band class gets to play some pieces from it! A bit gory for littler kids, but fun for ages 7 and up to see how ""old"" movies were. :) I'm personally a huge fan of Star Wars, and a total nerd about it! It has that bittersweet ending in which it leaves you hanging, but then you can go and see the next one to see what happens! And a great music selection all through the entire movie. Good actors and actresses for the age too! Also great for the people who saw it when it was in the theatres, because it can bring back good memories. Watch it!"
23031,False,"An old childhood favorite of mine, E.S.B. is a great installment to the Star Wars series even with his bad criticism. The film told a great journey for the team and progressed their stories more, in a way you wouldn't expect. The film's fighting is amazing (unforchantly not a lot of light saber action) and gave the world the ultimate phrase of all time, ""... I am your father."" My only complaint though is the missing light saber action, I mean no offense to anyone who likes gun action , but we go see these films to see the awesome light sabers. Its a film worth checking out and a reason to continue watching the series of films."
23032,False,This is the best star wars movie ever created. This movie was perfectly filmed. This was definitely the darkest star wars film in the entire series. I loved seeing how many things happened in this movie like seeing the millennium falcon getting chased by tie fighters and showing Yoda for the first time and also seeing Luke in a light saber duel against Darth Vader and the battle of Hoth and most importantly finding out that Darth Vader is Luke's father. This movie is one the best movies ever made in the history of movies. This movie has more action than you can imagine. Even though George Lucas didn't direct this film it was still perfectly written. This will always be my favorite movie of all time.
23033,False,"Story author and executive producer George Lucas truly managed to outdo himself when it came to making a sequel to his landmark 1977 ""Star Wars"" film. It combines an appreciably high level of character development with some genuinely exciting and riveting scenes, and introduced the well loved character of diminutive Jedi master Yoda into the formula. Villainous Darth Vader is brought to the forefront rather than being a lackey to somebody else. The relationship between cocky spaceship pilot Han Solo and serious minded rebel leader Princess Leia evolves to where romance can finally take place. And Luke Skywalker becomes more than just the naive and idealistic farm boy, letting his emotions get the better of him.With the directing chores being handed over to Irvin Kershner (""A Fine Madness"", ""Up the Sandbox"", ""Eyes of Laura Mars""), ""The Empire Strikes Back"" marks a maturation in terms of story quality, as well as a willingness to go to some dark places. After all, as it begins, it sees its hero in serious jeopardy. It's never treated as a given that Good will prevail. The screenplay is credited to Leigh Brackett (""The Big Sleep"", ""Rio Bravo"", ""El Dorado"") and Lawrence Kasdan (""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Body Heat"", ""The Big Chill""), and stars Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher make the most of the material. The endearing Yoda is one of those examples of a puppet who truly does become a character rather than just a gimmick. The film is a little short on cool aliens, but it does feature a Yeti-like monster called a Wampa, and an enormous slug used in a funny ""worm in the apple"" sort of gag. The spectacle is fantastic, but it never overwhelms the story. The early battle scene on the ice fields of the planet Hoth is incredibly well executed, and the final lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader (who of course has a revelation in store for the youngster) offers one thrill after another.The special effects are as impressive as ever, and it would be difficult to hear that memorable John Williams score and not get into the spirit of the thing. You truly care about the characters and want to see what will happen with them. And it delivers an ending that perfectly captures a sense of uncertainty and a degree of despair, setting up the problems to be solved in the next film.This is definitely a milestone blockbuster that holds up well 33 years later.10 out of 10."
23034,False,"It has been echoed an infinite amount of times before. It has been chanted from the highest hilltops and the most well known critic sites on the internet. It has been said time and time again. Star Wars Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back is not only the best Star Wars movie, but the best movie sequel ever made, and a prime example of how follow ups can match up and even prevail over their predecessors. While I like the prequels and the film that started it all in 77, The Empire Strikes Back has always been the SW film that glowed the most for me and had the best scenes out of the entire saga. It also introduced my all time favorite Star Wars character and my favorite movie character in general, brought to life by a man who based the character's look and facial expressions off his own. The Empire Strikes Back is the ideal Star Wars film for me, and although it received a mixed reception when it was first released, it has garnished a monstrosity of a following these last couple decades and it shines as one of the greatest sci-fi thrillers with loads of twists and turns to quench your thirst. From the opening battle on the snowy world of Hoth to the final confrontation between Luke and his soon to be revealed father, Darth Vader, this film has a scale, a scope, a powerful, eminent feeling to it. John Williams' exuberant score plays through like an orchestra at an opera and each scene carries suspense and magnitude as you see the events the main characters must live through. As a sequel, it also digs much deeper into the characters' souls and puts them up against powerhouses we never thought they'd go up against, not even in the first movie. Luke Skywalker must train to become a jedi on the swamp planet of Dagobah and at the same time, he must learn what makes the ways of a jedi work. He must be patient and believe in the unbelievable, which is something he fails to do at first (That is why you fail!). He also must learn to avoid the temptations of the dark side and learn what the force is all about. The force is not always about lifting things and tricking people's minds, it's a much bigger entity than Luke could ever imagine, and it's something that touches every life form. In a peanut shell, the force is with everything and allows all creatures to coexist and be bound together as one solid package. This is one of the many lessons Yoda teaches Luke in the second act of the movie.Luke's friends, Han and Leia are also met with extreme challenges in this sci-fi sequel. As they are constantly on the run from the relentless Empire, they must learn ways of hiding and working together for the benefit of surviving the Empire's vicious clawing. Han and Leia must also balance their romantic feelings for one another and learn to get along as well as not let their inner devils get the best of them. But in the realm of seriousness, there is also a bit of comedy and endless excitement. I love Han's relationship with C-3P0 (Never tell me the odds!) and that the Millennium Falcon is always malfunctioning and breaking down. It can't even make the jump to light speed, which it did so frivolously in the first outing. The chase through the asteroid field remains one of my all time favorite scenes out of the saga and John Williams' score for the scene amplifies it's awesomeness. Now let's talk about Yoda, my favorite Star Wars character and movie character of all time. Designed by Stuart Freeborn, Yoda drew inspiration from Albert Einstein, Buddha and even Kermit the Frog, but overall came off as a wise little creature with a brain as big as the galaxy itself. He undeniably has the best dialogue out of the movie and at times, it's hard to believe that Yoda was a puppet and not some real life alien from another world. Luke takes his teachings seriously, but when Vader uses Luke's fears to his advantage (by torturing Han and Leia), he flees in a state of franticness and his inexperience is the main reason why he fails against Vader in the Cloud City ""windy room"". When Darth Vader revealed himself to be Luke's father, many jaws dropped, many undies were pooped, and many gasps were heard throughout the theaters back in 1980. Today, the climatic twist is still as legendary as it was then and it has been lampooned bazillions of times on television shows, parodies and other movies. What makes the scene great is the build up. It's something we weren't expecting and when it came, it smacked us hard in the faces. Of course, there is so much more to talk about, like the Fett man, the awesome Harryhausen style stop motion of the AT-ATS and the tauntauns, the brilliant, exotic looks of the environments and the overall quality of the film, but I've rambled on long enough. The Empire Strikes Back is a mesmerizing experience that still holds up some 33 years later. If you had to watch one Star Wars movie and didn't know which one to watch, why not give this one a viewing. I don't even think you need to see the first film to enjoy this masterpiece, for it's energy and richness makes it stick out like pink hair. It's truly an experience that will leave lifelong lasting memories, so if you need a getaway, take a trip to that galaxy far, far away and let George Lucas' imagination do the talking."
23035,False,"A movie that stand as a milestone in our recent film history. It not only changed the films that where made in the 70's, it changed the genre: Science Fiction; By it's groundbreaking special effects, by it's storytelling, use of shots, etc. George Lucas proves with this film that he is a master in creating worlds. A master in telling stories and one of the founding fathers of Science Fiction and Special Effects. On a more technical base, he reinvented the use of Panavision. The movie is the second one in the Star Wars franchise. And it proves to be a promising franchise, that continues to surprise the audience. It was better that it's predecessor 'A new Hope' and for me the perfect movie. I'm looking forward for the adaptation of J.J. Abrams' new Episode VII. Although I don't approve the purchase of Lucasfilm ltd. by the money-machine Disney."
23036,False,"TESB is widely regarded as one of the best sequels of all time. A film that put the original in its place and some even say, brought it to shame. Like its predecessor I saw this in its original cut on VHS when I was 5 and I fell in love with the series.The plot is that Luke goes to Dagobah after hearing a message from Obi-Wan Kenobi to train from his old master, Yoda. Han, Chewbacca, Leia and threepio try to escape the Empire after they invaded a rebel base on Hoth and they find their way to Bespin with the intention of repairing the Millennium Falcon because Han is a friend of the owner of Cloud City.Now the acting is actually amazing. Fischer and Hamil actually pull off decent portrayals of Leia and Luke. Harrison Ford, Frank Oz and James Earl Jones...no comment. I have to put in a good word for Clive Revill who played The Emperor. I prefer his portrayal to McDiarmid's.I also love the humor. This is the only Star Wars title to add in humor with the exception of Revenge Of The Sith and that is what makes them the best two of the series, for me. They don't take themselves too seriously.As far as the visual effects go, they are still believable. I can still see the Empire ships and say ""okay, I can buy that those are real."" Overall this is a great entry in the series and is well worth a watch for any Star Wars fan."
23037,False,"With the stage set in A New Hope, and with a cast of fresh likable characters in a vast galaxy, The Empire Strikes Back provides a follow-up that many consider to be the best Star Wars film in the franchise. The film definitely pumps up the stakes as the Rebels are driven away in a massive battle, before the characters become hunted, and ultimately entangled in a web of treachery. This film will probably always be memorable for its big reveal towards the end though; an epic twist of fate that undoubtedly surprised everybody back in 1981. Overall, this film is darker than its predecessor, much more serious than any of the other films, and has a certain theatrical flair that could supersede every other film in the series.The film takes itself more seriously than any of the other films in the series, which will be most appealing to most audiences. Personally, I favor A New Hope and Return of the Jedi more for their adventurism. However, the story is decent. Characters remain as strong as ever, with a nice bit of added romance and plenty of added background to keep them fresh and lively. The plot structure is decent, and it is ultimately interesting to see the big plot the Imperials develop to trap the main characters. My only real complaint is that this is still only the middle part of the overall story arc; by the end of the movie, you can tell that the characters still have a ways to go yet.The film is well-made, with good photography and editing. Special effects are as strong as ever. Acting and writing are still a little campy, but are mostly earnest. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, and everybody else are quite decent, and remain true to their respective characters. Writing is not bad. Production value features lots of excellent sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is good.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)"
23038,False,"A decidedly slower paced chapter in the Star Wars saga, but also an incredible sequel. Everything from the thickening plot to the lovable characters, the incredible set piece moments to the sweeping and epic original score that accompanies them, Ep. V sets the bar for sequels. It's entertaining, fun, wild, and intriguing. Exploring deeper into a universe is always fun. It's Filled with famous lines and scenes, memorable battles and epic flights through space, Star Wars Episode V is nothing short of incredible. The are, like all of the Star Wars films, a little weird A classic, only to be followed by another classic!"
23039,False,"Now I will continuously say that when I was a kid I enjoyed all things Star Wars. From the movies, to the video games, to just about anything. However I stopped watching them when I was 10 or 11 (maybe because I was sick of them). This is the first time I have watched this movie in about five years and this is what I think.I really enjoyed the contribution of humour in this one. The problem with stuff like A New Hope and others, at least from what I remember is that they take themselves too seriously.Now the direction from Irvan Kirshner is great. I would say he made a better Star Wars movie than George Lucas ever did. Why he didn't come back to direct another Star Wars movie? I have no idea. The same goes for the writers Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan.So if you found it in you to enjoy the first one (or even find it decent for that matter) then this one is even better."
23040,False,"""Empire had the better ending; Luke gets his hand cut off, finds out Vader's his father, Han gets frozen, and taken away by Bobba Fett, it ends on such a downnote. That's what life is, a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets."" - Dante Hicks, Clerks.One of my other justifications for remaining ignorant to the Star Wars franchise was the fact that I felt I had already seen them before. After hearing the above lines in Kevin Smith's Clerks, I had no ambition to seek out the series because of the fact that I already knew all, or most, of the major, visceral plot points in the second installment, The Empire Strikes Back. But even knowing these details going in, I still emerged as enthralled and as taken as ever. It's one of the most awe-inspiring, gripping sequels I've ever seen.My love for the series of Star Wars, so far, has likely been because I don't try to understand it all. I allow myself to sink into the films, letting the film's imagination, and my own, take me on a cinematic Odyssey. The less I look into the meaning of it all and the interworkings of the characters and series, the more, I feel, I see in terms of vision, writing, atmosphere, and style. Thank goodness I took this approach to The Empire Strikes Back, which employs all these elements with slick, constant entertainment. It abandons the cheery, free-spirited style of its predecessor in favor of a much dark enigma. Never before have I seen a film go from comforting entertainment to sheer calamity within one sequel.Perhaps much of this is thanks to Irvin Kershner, who takes over for Lucas in the directing department. After achieving monstrous success with the original Star Wars, against all conceivable odds, Lucas, who was perplexed at how to follow up the hit, sidelined himself to executive producer and hired Kershner to lend his vision with the screen. New writers by the names of Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan were hired to continue the harrowing tales of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), and Han Solo (Harrison Ford). I couldn't imagine the hesitation amongst fans when these creative decisions were made. They must've expected the absolute worst from a sequel to an explosive hit. Could it be like the extreme hesitation the Star Wars fanbase currently has now with J.J Abrams manning the camera and Michael Ardnt writing the script for the forthcoming Star Wars: Episode VII in 2015, or should I not even mention that? The wonderful thing about these new faces being the driving forces behind this film is that we get a different spin on these characters and their lives that isn't drab, redundant, or contrived. Had The Empire Strikes Back adopted the same sort of easy-going charisma of its predecessor, this could've easily been a cheap rehash of previously successful material. Instead, Kerschner, Brackett, and Kasdan wisely choose to further develop these characters, making their problems more three-dimensional, their personalities more vivid, and their biographies more interesting.Again, there are some terrific and grandiose special effects put to use here. The effects on the Millennium Falcon and the exterior shots of a galaxy far, far away is just marvelous and very appealing on the eyes. I'm always amazed at the naturalism of these effects, even for the late seventies/early eighties. Despite being largely products of computers and other visual mediums, they still possess an authentic and wonderfully realistic look to them.One particular instance is when Han, Leia, and the rest of the gang fly their ship into the asteroid farm, which is exactly what it sounds like. Dozens of asteroids hurl themselves at the ship at breakneck speeds, leaving Han (the driver) with little time to react and dodge them. The animation and visual technique of the asteroids is astonishing, and every moving object adopts gorgeous fluency and technical precision. It's a visual wonder to say the very least.The Empire Strikes Back beautifully carries the Star Wars franchise further than it might've even gone under the intense and uncompromising care of Lucas himself. The new faces delightfully provide us with more entertaining adventures and more eccentric characters such as Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), consistently keeping us in-tuned and intrigued with the limitless possibilities of this creative world. Like before, Hamill, Fisher, and Ford provide the most likable of chemistry, and the scenes of intensity and peril do not fall short of enthralling, even if one is aware of the outcome. There are many directions Return of the Jedi can take, but if it shows the gripping intensity of its predecessor and the truly mysterious nature of its original, then the possibilities are as endless as the galaxy the series inhabits.Starring: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, James Earl Jones, Frank Oz (voice), and Billy Dee Williams. Directed by: Irvin Kerschner."
23041,False,"Almost after every classic which has been fortunate enough to top the box-office, collect rave reviews, and be beloved by so many fans as well as common movie-goers! The thing that follows almost every time is a sequel! And 80 percent of the time it sucks... 15 percent of the time it's alright... And 5 percent of the time it's awesome and arguably better than the original! For me, The Empire Strikes Back is one of those 5 percent! And for me it is slightly better than the original, and one of my all time favorite movies! Following the worldwide success of Star Wars, Lucas quickly published that he would be writing a sequel, using ideas he couldn't fit in the original movie. This time Irvin Kershner would be directing the Star Wars flick. It went on to gross about as much money as the original, and it preceded the expectations for a Star Wars sequel! The Empire Strikes Back doesn't try to top the original at any point! The Empire Strikes Back takes off not long after the end of Star Wars! Luke, Han and Leia are now key fighters in The Rebellion, and Darth Vader is hot on the trail in the pursuit of Luke! Like Joss Whedon is planning to do with the Avengers 2, The Empire Strikes Back is a much more darker and personal movie flick, than the original movie was! The acting is much better as the actors have bonded with and understands their characters much better. The character development is better in this movie, even to the point where Leia and Han gets intimate! The movie is just downright equally as exciting and entertaining as the original, has tons of memorable dialog and scenes and an incredible story serving as a follow-up to the original! Gotta' give George Lucas credit for that! Luke Skywalker has become a professional resistance fighter, and well on the way to become a Jedi at this point! His acting is better, and his character is more interesting! Same goes for Carrie Fisher as Leia Organa! Harrison Ford is still as badass and as entertaining as in the first, and this time he's even got a really memorable line! Darth Vader is much more sinister in this movie, than in the original! He's got more really memorable lines, his character is much deeper and more ruthless! Darth Vader will always be my all-time favorite villain for this movie alone! Billy Dee Williams also debuts as a new smuggler and badass character! Frank Oz is magnificent as Yoda, and delivers an amazing performance!The technical category is awesome and better than in the original! The editing, sound and visuals are again amazing, and John Williams has a new theme tune for Darth Vader, called ""The Imperial March"". This tune is alone deserving of an Oscar. The movie took home 2 Oscars in the technical category! So... In the end you get: better acting, more memorable characters, more great lines, an equally amazing story, a fantastic screenplay, better direction, new great music and the characters are just downright better! Calling The Empire Strikes Back a sequel is a travesty! The description ""an expanded chapter for the original movie"" fits this masterpiece better! One of my and many other peoples favorite Star Wars movie, and favorite movie of all time!10/10"
23042,False,"This is just a great movie. The great thing about this movie is the relationship between the hero(Luke) and the villain (Vader) just gets more and more complicated. And the ending is just epic. In the prequels you just doesn't have this kind of connection, which is the main thing in the old star wars movies. The acting is also great and the introduction to this new character, Lando, is also interesting and well handled. you also get to meet the emperor for the first time, and WOW, what a creepy feller he is. But the thing that really makes star Wars, Star Wars, is John Williams score. It's just Great, and star wars is nothing without it's music. The practical effects is also stunning, and it is just wonderful to see the days when practical effects was the important stuff, and not CGI and green screen all over the place. My favorite movie of all time, well done! 10 out of 10 for me"
23043,False,"By far, the best of the Star Wars saga! The film surpassed Star Wars fans' expectations in 1980. It surpassed my expectations, too. The classic scene that includes Luke Skywalker battling Darth Vader. But he is clearly no match for Vader. Vader forces Luke to believe that he is his father, ""No, I am your father. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy together as father and son!"" James Earl Jones fits the voice of Darth Vader very well. Mark Hamill fits the role of Skywalker very well, also. The Empire Strikes Back has a lot more Darth Vader scenes than Star Wars did. It featured a lot more action including more light-saber fights."
23044,False,"A cinematic masterpiece and a complete Triumph! I was a little young to remember when; A New Hope came out but I did have all the figures etc. While the first film (vol 4) was an all time classic I think Empire is equal to its brilliance! I have the original 3 on VHS, DVD and now Blu-ray and I think that DVD version is the best. The main reason is that bluray makes it too clear and therefore it looks more dated.The story is quite unique and the effects are second to none. it's not as action packed as the first one or Return of the Jedi but it's more powerful. I would say it feels more real.The sets are unique and the story and characters raise the bar.Number 1 in my list and will always stay there.A truly epic movie, the likes that we will never see again!"
23045,False,"The star wars films are such hope invoking and awe inspiring films to ever grace me, i have watched them several times since i was young, and have read over a hundred books 2 or three times, perhaps more for some.The films are so imaginative and were the first real films of their kind in my opinion, the characters are brilliant and relatable and the film is so incredibly epic.Honestly i cut the review short, i don't want to ramble for 100 pages on why it is great and about all the characters, so i will just say how much i love the star wars universe and how i would love to be amongst it.Star wars is brilliant, a must watch."
23046,False,"This one is my favorite because it's when Han & Leia fall in love, when Lando comes into action and Han gets frozen in carbonite. I just love it so much. It will always & forever be my favorite. I love the droids, Chewbacca, the evilness of Darth Vader, and the acting from the entire cast. Mark Hamill is always adorable as Luke, Harrison Ford is always hilarious & gorgeous as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher is perfection as Leia Organa & Anthony Daniels as C-3PO & Kenny Baker as R2D2. The entire movie is perfection to be quite honest. George Lucas is a revolutionary genius and that is without a doubt the best way to in the best of terms put it. Don't take my word for it though, see this movie and see why I am correct in all aspects!"
23047,False,"This is the best one in the series, and when I say the series, I mean episode IV, V and VI. They shouldn't even be called IV, V or VI. THEY SHOULD BE CALLED I, II AND III! Who gives a damn about the prequels?Well, my point is: The Empire Strikes Back is by far the best one in the series. It's a complete movie in every single way.The story is masterful. The mystique, the action, the dialog. Clever and exciting.Without a doubt masterpiece. If George Lucas only gave a crap about integrity and art then maybe Star Wars wouldn't have been something you laugh at."
23048,False,"Sound, Art, Music, Special Effects, Costuming - these all make this a film worth revisiting on Blu ray. Even without surround sound, this is a special film to watch and enjoy.It was just an amazing adventure that took me back to seeing it for the first time in 1980. I enjoyed the performances, and I especially enjoyed Harrison Ford, who I don't think gets enough credit for his job in this film. Yes, Mark Hamill is good, but I just thought Ford was better.It is nice to go back and enjoy films like this. Even though the technology is better today, they were still special."
23049,False,"Following the monumental success of ""Star Wars,"" this opened up the opportunity for George Lucas to release the final two movies in the trilogy he set out to create. That's not saying that ""Empire"" didn't run into its fair share of problems, but regardless, this feels much more polished than ""Star Wars,"" and that is saying a LOT.Now, I certainly think that ""Star Wars"" is one of the greatest motion pictures of all times, a fantastic, A+, perfect film. The sequel, ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" however, is a complete game changer. Everything is bigger and better than ever. The visual effects are superior to the already impressive originals, and the actions sequences are more explosive, but even from a storytelling standpoint, ""Empire"" takes things to a whole new level.The story continues with Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, and the rest of the gang at the Rebel base on the ice planet Hoth, but following an attack by an Imperial fleet, the team is split up, with Luke setting out to the Dagobah system to train with the ancient Jedi master Yoda, and the rest of the gang evading capture by the evil Darth Vader, who is back and more villainous than ever. The story this time around is much darker, much more mature, and more fleshed out. It develops the story without being a mere retread of the previous film, and yet, it still maintains that trademark Star Wars feel that made the first one so good. The comic relief is sharper and wittier, the characters are developed in a really natural and fascinating way, and the new characters like Yoda, Boba Fett, and Lando Calrissian also perfectly find their niche in Star Wars lore, fitting in perfectly with the rest.All in all, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" takes everything that made the first film so fantastic, and improves it significantly, and then turns it on its head. If ""Star Wars"" is one of the best sci-fi fantasy films ever made, then ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is THE best sci-fi fantasy film ever made. One of the few perfect films in history. I love this movie, and I can't rave about it enough. It's a classic."
23050,False,"The fifth (or second) installment of the highly successful ""Star Wars"" franchise, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" really took me along for the ride. Set three years after the original, the Galactic Empire, in the clutches of Darth Vader, are still in pursuit of tracking down Luke Skywalker and his small band of friends, including Han Solo and Princess Leia. When Luke tries to learn the Force from Jedi Master Yoda, and his friends are captured by Vader, he must decide whether to complete his training to become a Jedi master, or confront Vader to save his friends. Wow, what a movie. As a big fan of the original, I'm an even bigger fan of ""Empire Strikes Back"". This movie blew me away with everything new. The characters are still memorable, the visual effects are still awesome, the environment is breathtaking, the story just got better, and the character of Yoda was just plain awesome. But my favorite part in the whole movie was the final confrontation between Luke and Vader, and the climatic ending, that's better to be left unspoiled, is one of the greatest endings ever seen in a movie. Also, this movie was actually very dark, due to containing some graphic moments of blood, killings, and even torture. I was just thinking the same exact thing: ""awesome""! I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish, and I was blown away by how better the series gets. This is the most darkest, thrilling, and jaw-dropping movie of the whole series so far. Again, this is so far, my favorite Star Wars movie in the series. ""The Empire Strikes Back"", in my review, ""an entertaining spectacle, truly an excellent masterpiece""."
23051,False,"It's now an accepted fact that the first Star Wars is regarded as one of the most, or amongst some communities, the most successful movie of all time both in terms of critical acclaim and box office gross. Attempting a sequel to a movie of such magnitude, while an exciting prospect from the movie goers' perspective, is a suicidal task for the crew behind the same. One can only imagine the immense pressure of expectations that the makers of this film would have gone through while making this movie and even more so when the movie eventually saw the light. However, this movie not only fulfills all such hopes that fans of the first movie would have from the sequel but takes the Star Wars franchise into an even better and exciting territory, and improving upon the minor flaws of the first, turns out to be an adventure that can be regarded as good as perfect in all aspects of film-making. Although I had gotten a slight hint of this from the forums and internet talk, I now realize why this is regarded as the best movie in the Star Wars universe.There's little need to get into the plot as it is best experienced by watching the movie directly. To describe it in short though, Darth Vader is desperately after Luke Skywalker and wants to turn him to the dark side. In an attempt to capture him, he plans to use his friends Han Solo and Princess Leia as bait. Meanwhile, Luke, guided by Obi-Wan Kenobe's voice through the mystical Force must travel to Dagobah where he must learn the true ways of a Jedi Knight in order to confront the evil lord Darth Vader.Once again, all the elements that made the original Star Wars a success abound in the sequel. There's a well conceived story put together in place, great writing and editing that makes all the sequences feel connected to each other allowing them all to flow together, there's the original cast giving better performances this time being more aware of their characters, and of course, there's the by now famous Star Wars opening musical piece. Lucas, busy handling his newly established visual effects house and finances, hands over the directorial reins to his trusted professor Irvin Kershner. A professor at the University of Cinema Sciences, the way he handles the epic sequences while at the same time concentrating on expanding and developing the characteristic traits of the main cast gives the film an emotional depth which was sorely lacking in the original movie and which was one of my complaints with that film - the characters there were appeared too flat and devoid of personality as though they were just going through the motions. The presence of some character development this time allows us to connect with them even better which in turn makes the situations in which they get involved in a lot more engaging. Amongst all, the character of Han Solo as a dependable ""scoundrel"" is what really stands out; Ford plays him out in a near perfect way which is not only consistent with what Solo was in the first film, but also takes it in a further positive direction. His sequences with Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia are amongst the high points of the movie and are brilliantly played out. We also see Mark Hamill as a now slightly more mature Luke Skywalker as he journeys to Dagobah to learn the ways of a true Jedi from the strangely voiced Yoda. And of course there's the inseparable duo of C-3PO and R2-D2 who are actually forced to stay apart from each other for a major portion of this movie. As much as I can admit to not being able to understand anything R2 says, I have inexplicably grown to like his presence immensely in Star Wars.The film features visual effects and action on a scale that's almost twice as big as its predecessor (the budget only confirms this). Spending $32 million on a movie in 1980 would not have been regarded as a wise decision but thank goodness that Lucas decided to go for it or we might not have been able to witness space battles on such a huge scale. The battle on the ice planet at the start of the movie is brilliantly staged and a behind the scenes documentary sheds some light on how some of these miraculous shots were achieved. What's really great about the action is that unlike the heavily edited action sequences of present films wherein the average shot just lasts for about 2-3 seconds, shots in Star Wars last longer making the action very comprehensible and easy to follow. Its easy to see the strategies being adopted by each side while fighting as opposed to units just being brought down by random shots fired by people / creatures obscured by the miss-mash editing. And the best sequence of the movie comes towards the end in an epic battle between Luke and Darth Vader that literally will send your pulse racing. Even more exciting is the battle's infamous outcome which I shall not reveal.Movies like The Empire Strikes Back come only once in a while. Perhaps, every decade must have only a few of these movies present. Fans would obviously come up with a few nitpicks here and there but as far as my opinion goes, this movie is perfect in every aesthetic and area of film-making I'm ever aware of. Now that this movie has set such high standards for the Star Wars saga, I wonder where the next movies will take me. Suffice it to say, The Empire Strikes Back strikes a positive blow from which recovery is simply not possible. A winner all the way !!! Score: 10 / 10"
23052,False,"Han Solo and Luke Skywalker become the most famous space-frontiersmen of all-time.This is the penultimate moment in movie history. The answer to the question: Can a sequel be better than the original? Even Lucas' attempts to ""enhance"" the film over a decade later would be futile. It was like trying to ""enhance"" a classic song. You cannot improve upon it - you can only mess it up.The puppet Yoda would later give way to the CGI Yoda, but Yoda would never be as significant nor as powerful as he was in ""The Empire Strikes Back"".This film is basically three acts. Hoth. The Degoba System(sp?). Cloud City.The movie moves at a breakneck pace, and the film's action sequences have a degree a realism in the model-usage that still seems unrivaled with CGI.The film manages to be funny without being corny, action-packed without being unrealistic, and iconic without being cliché.No film is perfect, but this is very close. It is hard for any avid movie fan to come up with a top ten, but this is unquestionably top 5 for me.I'm 38. Many films had an impact on my life. Blade Runner, Back to the Future, Star Wars, Empire, Platoon, SIxteen Candles, Breakfast Club, Ferris Buellers, E.T., CLose Encounters, Goonies, Raider's, Bond FIlms Etc, etc. This film IS my childhood. If bias means the best film from your childhood - then I'm bias. The Empire Strikes Back could be the best film ever made.You'll Like this if you liked: The Wizard of Oz, Raider's of the Lost Ark, Star Wars, or Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade.""Now all I have to do is find this Yoda - if he even exists"""
23053,False,"Many people regard this as the best of Star Wars movies. The details and the story are much more denser than the first installment.I've heard that many people were in tears when they saw this movie for the first time in the theaters. I was certainly in awe with the even more refined visuals of this movie. The prop designs in the first three episodes were great, and they provided the feeling that you were out there having a great adventure. The first Star Wars was shocking to see, this one was pure excitement. I don't think there was a case where the sequel was so good as this one in movie history.This is the finest science fiction movie ever made, and since Lucas himself couldn't top this effort, I will guess that it will be long time before anyone does."
23054,False,"This is by far the best movie in the Star Wars Saga. Irvin Kershner is far superior to George Lucas as a director, because he takes the film seriously. By looking at the prequels it is apparent that if George had control of this film it would have been a lighthearted ""Kids Movie"". This movie is the most dark in the saga, and deals with real emotions and questions. Kershner details the plot, character and mood with beautiful elegance and subtlety. The score is amazing. The action is tense and epic, despite the lack of thousands of CGI robots. The message is deeper and in my opinion is the only Star Wars movie that really gets you thinking in a deep way. Make no mistake, this isn't just a popcorn-munching movie, it is something altogether more important. It is really one of the few movies that extremely successfully mixes nail-biting excitement, epic action and character into a true masterpiece of cinema."
23055,False,"Episode V ""The Empire Strikes Back"" released in 1980 in my opinion was a great sequel to the 1977 original. As far as quality it closely ranks to the original, and in terms of character development, and plot and as far as the storytelling goes it's probably better than the 1977 original. Directed this time around by Irvin Kershner he does just as good a job with the sets, characters, and special effects work as Lucas did making it just as good as 1977's. Here the saga now has a setting on the ice planet of Hoth, a place that the Rebels have hid from the evil empire in pursuit, with the real goal they have is to reach the fabulous city of Bespin nicknamed Cloud City for it's airy view. Here's when this installment becomes a real coming of age sequel in which the central character Luke Skywalker comes of age both in terms of skill and mind, and that's when he makes a stop in the swamp of Dagobah. It is in the swamps that hold an important part of the saga and the development of the Skywalker character is found here by training with the appearance of the Jedi master Yoda(hey, nice little green puppet!) as Luke's skill of mind and fighting ability is formed making one reason that Episode V is so important. Later a dark secret is revealed, by Darth Vader in the climax at cloud city, and it was just great to see the fierce battle between Luke and Vader to close out this installment. Overall ""The Empire Strikes Back"" might be the best of the saga in terms of the coming of age development of the central character(Luke). Also the plot finally reveals the hidden truth that's a very dark secret, and the introduction of a new and unique character(Yoda) holds the saga together just great. This really is just as good as the 1977 original simply because more key elements are shown and discovered, the only rule of law is I usually don't rank sequels over the original."
23056,False,"Perhaps the best science fiction movie ever made. This movie defines sequels as it is know today. The movie goes light years ahead from the first in every way; special effects that to this day even look better those modern sci/fi movies of today. The characters are defined and the saga really begins in this epic story. Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Leia suffer difficult and effective changes though out the movie. The introduction of Yoda as the tinny Jedi master was amazing, the former smuggler, and Solo's best friend Lando as a two face allied was perfect. The fearsome and imposing Darth Vader with his deep voice is for me the best performance of James Earl Jones ever. The light saber duel between Luke and Vader was dramatic and surprising. And the revelation ""no, I am your father"" it has become a pop culture phenomenon. Empire is the best of all the 6 film succeeding where others have failed."
23057,False,"This is by far the best of the star wars series, with AOTC second.  It was voted #16 by  imdb viewers. I'm going to be bold enough to call it the greatest film ever made. The asteriod scene is my favourite with Han-solo navigating  the millenium falcon with a right balance of humour and action in between.  As a kid this film had always fascinated me I knew ever scene and words the actors would say and never got bored of it.  when you watch it now it doesn't seem that much dated.  The character developments and specail fx are brilliant.  I heard best buddy Speilberg originally wanted to help lucas in this but was refused, they both went on to make the indiana Jones triologies.  A question I've always been asking is why aren't any of the original triolgies ever released on DVD."
23058,False,"There is no real point commenting on this film so i dont know why i am bothering. Its like reviewing Air or Food. Everyone knows how good it is and why it will continue to be regarded as a classic piece of cinema for many years to come.One thing i will say, though, is that watching this again makes me wish Lucas had turned the reigns over to someone else to direct, at the very least, AOTC and maybe TPM as well. It is a masterpiece. I fully respect Lucas for the rich and varied world he has masterminded, well thought out characters and intricate plots, but this film is a harsh reminder of what others can do with his dream. I hope he watches ESB and learns a few lessons."
23059,False,"It is 3 years after Episode IV and the Rebels are on the run from the Empire. Luke Skywalker explores his Jedi heritage only to be confronted with disturbing truths, Darth Vader continues his quest tom punish the Rebels, and Han and Leia are on the run. The galaxy has become a much darker, more dangerous place.After a traumatizing experience directing the first Star Wars film, series creator George Lucas vowed he would stay away from the camera this time, and crank up his degree of control. Because, while production had been misery, young George had negotiated the shrewdest deal in film history: exclusive rights on all Star Wars related content and derived products. When Star Wars became not just A hit but THE hit of the century, Mr Lucas held all the cards.While the subsequent creation of a prequel trilogy might taint the whole story in retrospect, one should admire George Lucas for opting to be as faithful to his story as possible, and for deploying unprecedented independent power to back his vision. So Lucas enlisted director Irvin Kershner as well as writers Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kadan and put them to work. Lucas kept his focus on overall production and the effects work, the complexity of which far exceeded anything attempted 3 years prior.The result, any Star Wars fan will concede, is not just the finest film in the series but one of the best sequels ever made. Much like the benchmark Godfather Part II, it builds on and deepens the themes of its predecessor while exploring new, unchartered territory. It also took many brave narrative risks, most of them ruined by the unnecessary prequels. it gave the characters new depth and resonance, along with some of the most memorable dialogue in a series not often noted for its language or performances.Watching the bad guys have their day can be a thrilling experience and, as the title implies, this is the Empire's film through and through. Vader is at his most enigmatic and evil, and John Williams already legendary score achieves new heights unrivaled since. This is everything you could possibly want from a sequel to the greatest space opera in existence."
23060,False,"The Empire Strikes Back has everything great about Star Wars and then some. It's the best Star Wars movie ever, not to mention one of the greatest movies of all time. It has all the good points of the first movie - action, suspense, comedy, romance, drama - and improves upon them with slightly better effects and a deeper and darker plotlines. Perfection attained. Everyone should see this movie. bye."
23061,False,"This movie is probably the reason why so many people devoted their lives to worshiping the saga George Lucas had started three years earlier. Here the adventure continues, but with a twist - after having the basic characters thrown in the first one, here we get a souping-up, and everything and every one is multiplied by 100. The result is the best movie in the Star Wars saga. Here we have some rawness typical of A New Hope, and we still don't have the excesses of Return of the Jedi. The result is a brutally touching movie, where its characters are the main theme and not the battles or the special effects. Magnificent work by everyone involved, the movie is a triumph, and one of the best movies ever. John Williams also suceeds to beat his own work, and present us with a richly crafted score."
23062,False,"All the Star Wars films are very good, but Empire Strikes Back is the best of the series.  The story line is more convoluted than the rather straight froward A New Hope and Return Of The Jedi.  Though it lacks the special effects of the more recent trilogy, ESB has better interaction between the characters.The growing romance between Han and Leia is paced just right.  The rise of Luke to power under the guidance of Yoda shows the tension and respect that often exist between experts and trainees.  The comedy act of R2D2 and C3PO is classic.These actors, often criticized in the other films, do very well in ESB. Ford and Fisher give their best performances in the whole trilogy in this episode (Hamill was more consistent through the series).10/10"
23063,False,Darth Vader beats Luke and everything seems to work for the Empire in its quest to destroy the rebels.  Prehaps the best of the whole trilogy. Definitely worth the praise.  Special effects are amazing and even the script works.  Yoda jedi master is introduced and the puppet is the most endearing character in the whole trilogy.
23064,False,"The Empire Strikes Back is a bit more improved from the original.First, the writing. The writing in A New Hope really needed a polish, but it really is pretty good here, though nothing Oscar-calibar. Also we get to see the great Yoda here, which he was absent in A New Hope.Second, the acting. Mark Hamill is better here than he was in A New Hope, probably because he is in more dangerous situations than he was in A New Hope. I think this is because in the original and ROTJ, Hamill was pretty bland and flat unless if he was in a real turning point or in danger, which was pretty scarce in those films except when he found his aunt and uncle dead, or a couple of other situations I forget. Carrie Fisher isn't as semi-wooden here either, she is actually quite good.Thridly, the effects look more polished. In the original they looked cheesy at best, but here, they look more smooth and real, except for the creatures at the beginning of the film were Luke was stranded. But the lightsabres look better, the sound effects are smoother, and is more pleasing.Fourthly, the plot is more devolped. The plot in the original felt like it was stolen from a medival fairy tale with princesses, here, it shows more of The Dark Side, the characters are more devolped, the suspence is better, and the events are more layered.Overall, this is great polish-up from A New Hope. One gripe though would have to be how the irony from the original lacks here, but it is still a great film.9/10"
23065,False,"What can I say about a film I've seen more than 30 times? This is my favourite of all Star Wars films and as I'm a huge SW fan, it is also my favourite film of all time. It has my favourite soundtrack of any film. I especially like 'The Empirial March' and the Han and Leia Love them which ends the film so beautifully, it brings tears to my eyes.There are so many fantastic scenes in this film - the Battle of Hoth, the chase through the asteroids, the introduction of Yoda and Boba Fett, the training of Luke and especially the emotional lightsaber dual between Luke and Vader and of course, the big revelation at the end.I have long since memorized most of the lines and, much to the chagrin of my friends, speak them out loud whenever we see the film. I also hum and whistle along to the music.Everything about this film is wonderful - the dialogue, the performances (especially Mark Hamill's. The best of his career), the action set-pieces, the bad guys (Boba is just sooo cool), the special effects (which look better than CGI in my opinion), the characterisation and most of all, the plot.All in all, a 'must-see-again-and-again' film if ever there was one.Rating 10/10(the 10 rating above all others, if there is such a thing)"
23066,False,"This was the best of them.  Darker in tone, more exciting in general.  The best acting of the three.  The introduction of Yoda (probably the best actor in the movie).  Darth Vader's revelation.  Han and Leia's relationship. The list goes on.  This one has made Star Wars itself more fabulous by adding to the scope and granduer of the story.  Made Return of the Jedi into a bit of an anti climax."
23067,False,"Tomorrow night at Midnight I will see the next chapter in the saga that is Star Wars.  Tonight I watched them all again to refresh my memory of what it is all about to give a better viewing of Episode II: Attack of the Clones tomorrow night at 12 am. 	I initially saw Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back on its opening weekend in a small theater in Crescent City, CA as a touch more than a neophyte movie aficionado.  Hitchcock flicks were my favorite at that time.  Hitch is still one of my favorite past filmmaker with Hawks and Capra close seconds. These days my tastes lean to Scorsese, Aronofsky and the Coen Brothers. Coppola, Speilburg and Lucas are very good, but to me are more great craftsman than great artists.  All have had artistic successes (The Godfather, Schindler's List and THX 1138), but I think they are better craftsman than artists over all. 	Lucas is by far one of the greatest producers and craftsman of all time and has done more for true independent film than possibly any director/producer since Chaplin.  I also feel strongly that Empire is a far better film than Star Wars with tighter pacing, dialog and performances all around.  The was a fluidity that the first one lacked and feel that was built in was not only what was ""tight about it"". 	The ""weaknesses"" of Star Wars as a piece of ""art"", or even craft is dwarfed by its emotional impact and timing of release.  I was ten when I saw it the first time (several weeks after it was released) and I had to share a seat in the front row with my younger brother who didn't like me much at the time.  Once the music started and the words rolled up the screen we didn't care and loved every single second!  All we told our dad when he met us out front afterwards was ""can we see  it again dad, can we see it again dad..."". I saw it eleven time in the theater that summer including three time in a row on a great day.  This is amazing since my town had only one theatre/screen and it was exceptional that it stayed around long enough for me see it as often as I  did.   The Trilogy was the first VHS I ever owned (my mother paid $70 each in 85). 	My point is that emotional attachment, or detachment to a film is equally important to what a person may think of it critically as a piece of art, or entertainment.  I have loved all the Star Wars films and have seen them all except for the first one on its opening day and even the first show of that day with the last two!  All that said however, I wouldn't call any of them ""great films"".  Important and amazing films, ""Hell Ya!"".  Some of the best rides I have ever had, ""Hell Ya!"".  Worth watching all in a row every now and again, you bet. 	Episode V is more of a love story and character developing episode IV which is why it tends to be many folks favorite thus far.  Knowing it will be a blast and finding out that Vader is really Luke's dads only bolsters it.  I think Jedi is the best still and part of that may be the fact that I knew that Blue Harvest was really Star Wars III (episode VI) when they shot all the wonderful ""forest"" scenes.  I didn't watch them do it, but knowing it was happening and that the speeder chases were truly impossible (since I lived and played Star Wars in those woods), yet there they were right in front of my eyes. This may be why it still has the strongest hold on my heart!  I don't think that the story of Jedi significantly better than Empire, but I am more into temptation, redemption and what is and is not destiny which is more deeply explored and acted out in Jedi. 	Love one, love them all it is tough to chose."
23068,False,"When I first saw this movie as youngster, I thought it was good, but i was into the Action Packed Star Wars and Return of the Jedi better, but now i have a different outlook of it. Now it my fav of the series and probably of all movies. It has deep meaning to it. The scenes with the all-knowing Yoda and Luke. There also were some good action sequences on Hoth, the Icy planet. But the duel between Vader and Skywalker is one of the best sword fights EVER! If there is anyone out there who is reading this and hasn't seen this movie or Starwars, then see them all NOW. As a matter of fact, u can probably bye them for a cheap price as a set at your local Best Buy or where ever."
23069,False,"I agree I really enjoy the Empire Strikes Back. Out of all the 4 Star Wars films I think that it is the second best of the lot. what annoys me is how unanimously most reviewers automatically point out that Return of the Jedi is the worst of the series.(Many even say that the childish film, TPM is better than ROTJ???!!huh???!!!!!!) To be quite frank, WHY?After reading surprising reviews from critics and fans alike I feel like it is necessary to point out why ROTJ is better than ESB:1)First of all, except for the ""I am your father"" it was not as emotional and sentimental as Return of the Jedi. Sure the ""I am your father"" statement was a surprise, but I get tears in my eyes when Luke reveals to his sister the truth about how they are siblings. But even that pales compared to the last 40 minutes of the movie which is an extremely dark confrontation between Luke/Darth Vader/Palpatine. Darth Vader's final redemption is just the most touching/meaningful scene out of all the Star Wars movies. And the ""I am your father"" statement just does not have as much sting as ""Father... Father I will not leave you.."" and then Anakin dies.. or even ""You have failed your highness, I am a Jedi like my father before me.""2)Has anyone ever thought how silly it was for Luke to learn how to become a near Jedi after one afternoon and nearly defeat Vader? Come on, he did not even know how to handle a lightsaber before he met Yoda.. All of a sudden he is doing all those impressive flips and swashbuckling moves? Give me a break. Or how about knowing how to use the force to get to Bespin? How? A Jedi that can barely use the force to lift pebbles. Hello?3) This movie was slower paced. I must agree that some of the sequences in the asteroid belt seemed to drag at times. Jedi, (the longest of the three) on the other hand gripped you for all its 133 minutes.4) Where is the big space battle? I like to see spaceships getting blown up... Is this ""Star Wars"" or ""Star Trek""? On the other hand, the Space Battle in ROTJ is widely considered The Greatest Space Battle Ever Filmed.5) The Battle of Endor was great because it was ironic and unexpected. Everyone says how much they hate the Ewoks but the charming thing about this battle was that the Imperials were supposed to win since Palpatine had foreseen it. I was in turmoil after the line--""Your friends over there on the Endor moon are walking into a trap.. It (the shield generator) is quite safe from your pitiful band...An entire legion of my best troops await them.. Oh! I think that the shield generator will be quite operational when your friends arrive.."" After this I thought how could the rebels possibly win when the Empire had the upper hand. When the Ewoks came and surprised everyone I was breathtaken! I always get emotional when I see the underdogs take on a much more powerful foe!Empire Strikes Back is a great movie in its own right But.. Special kudos goes to the greatest film in cinematic history-- Episode 6:Return of the Jedi."
23070,False,"A New Hope set the standard in movie storytelling and special effects.  The Empire Strikes Back blows that away.  A New Hope and The Empire Strikes back, to me, are about equal in their greatness, but for different reasons. While A New Hope was great because it was the first that broke new ground, The Empire Strikes back is great because it broke new ground while having an almost entirely different story, mood, and flavor than it's predecessor.The acting in The Empire Strikes Back is superior to A New Hope.  Mark Hamill definitely got better at acting, and really got into his wide-eyed, impatient, trying to become a Jedi character.  Harrison Ford put more depth into Han Solo, making him more complex than just a shady smuggler.  Carrie Fisher gave a new dimension to Princess Leia by showing her attraction to Han Solo, and the way she shows it.  And of course, David Prowse/James E. Jones as Darth Vader, giving one of the most earth shattering revelations in a motion picture saga.  Anthony Daniels (who I forgot in my review of A New Hope) gives more comic relief to the movie with C-3PO.  An interesting new addition is Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissan.  As Solo gets more complex, we were given a new character who's shady background made for a shaky alliance with the other characters.  Also, who could forget Frank Oz puppeting Yoda, who has almost become a modern philosopher for our time.
The story and special effects of Empire blow away what A New Hope had already created as top notch.  The models are much more detailed a realistic and they serve the story even more.  I can remember as a kid being scared of the Imperial Probe Droid, which reminded me of a spider for some reason. The story is better with a darker mood.  Empire is really the heart of the story, going further into the mysteries of the Force and character development and backgrounds.  There is a sense of dread as Darth Vader talks to the Emperor, who is really orchestrating all of these events.  Also, Darth Vader's revelation at the end is shocking if you have never seen the movie before.The Empire Strikes back relied less on a large action scene and instead has many little ones with a great lightsaber duel at the end (although it is nothing compared to the lightsaber duel in The Phantom Menace).  Empire adds on to the modern mythology that A New Hope started and 'is' the best sequel ever.  I personally think it is the best out of all of the Star Wars movies, although it is hard to choose.  Go see it. ***** stars (out of *****)."
23071,False,"I've seen this movie lots of times, and I must say I never get tired of it. Some friends tell me I´m crazy about watching it so many times, but I just don´t get bored. As it is the one in the middle, Empire strikes back is the CLIMAX of the Star Wars Trilogy.From the first battle in the snow to lightsaber fight between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, this movie is full of action, adventure and suspense! If you haven´t seen it, do so."
23072,False,"Even better than the first one, this movie is fun! Better special effects and bigger adventures and to top it all: the mother of all soap opera plots!(And I bet EVERYONE knows what I'm talking about) Unlike the first movie, this one is not a stand-alone movie and it connects directly to the third (or should I say sixth?) and final part. You still get the feeling of a complete story and it's f-u-n. Lucas is a genius. Great characters, great worlds of wonder... Wow. Oh, and make sure you watch the special edition! Just buy the special edition trilogy."
23073,False,"I still think that ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the best one of the trilogy. I haven't seen the new Star Wars movie yet but that won't last for long. The reason why I think that this one's the best of the first trilogy, is because it is the darkest, it's the best sequel I've ever seen and it's got all the ingredients (romance, adventure etc.). Myfavorite scenes are still the ""asteroid belt sequence"" (I still don't know exactly how they pulled this one of) and the lightsabre duel at the end of the film.The fourth film was as George Lucas said primarily about introducing the characters. The fifth film was a more complicated one. It had to function as the bridge between episodes IV and VI. The drama was also more intense in this movie than in the other episodes. The last installment of the first made trilogy was primarily the climax or the ending of the complete told story.My final remark, if you haven't seen the Star Wars trilogy yet, wait until George Lucas has finished the Prequals."
23074,False,"i especially liked how the movie split to two separate stories and how everything came together for the good in the end, re-emphasizing the strength of this FORCE.not gonna say anything everyone's already said10/10"
23075,False,"The problem with this picture is that it is nearly impossible to top it.Why?Well: excellent Script; wonderful cast; brilliant SET-DESIGN, Sound, Special Effects, Make-Up FX(Yoda seem much more real than in the ""Phantom""); Funny; Wonderful Battle Scenes(HOTH); has a message; nearly no Violence and many other features....This movie combines so many things and makes them perfect!One of the best achievements in Art(belongs in to the Louvre) and Moviebuisness!Watch it!"
23076,False,Don't ask me why I liked this movie better than the others...I just did.Maybe it was the sabre battle between Darth and Luke on the skywalk.  Maybe it was Boba Fett.  Who cares....it was just terrific.An excellent movie!10 out of 10
23077,False,"Titanic is BIG, but it doesn't have a ""Hyperdrive""Star Wars's got a lot better toys.Yoda would have used the force to take the Titanic out of the sea.Leia is a princess, senator, fighter of the freedom, and wits. Rose is just a spoiled rich girl.The Ewoks make better parties than any ""first class"" on deck.If you fly to the Titanic, Wedge wouldn't say ""Look at the size of that thing"" seriously.Is much scarier being chased in a ship by a madman with a lightsaber than an a**hole with a gun.The admirals with big eyes don't lose their ships.We know that Cal is a bad guy because he cheats inferior people and treats his girlfriend as if she were his own. We know that Darth Vader is a bad guy because he strangles people and blows planets away whenever he feels to.Yes!!, Leonardo DiCaprio can dance, but, can he fly an X-wing?.Rose faces freezed water to rescue her boyfriend. Leia faces Jabba The Hutt.Two Words: John Williams.There's always enough escape pods on Star Wars.If Luke was handcuffed in one of the room of a sinking ship, he would've used the force to get the key.What do you prefer:     * To have sex on an old car inside ship's warehouse watching the ceiling. * To have sex on an Corellian Cruiser watching the stars.Rose words ""i'd rather be a whore than be your wife"" is not as cool as Leia's words ""i'd rather kiss a wookie"".Chewacca would've pull the arms out of their sockets to the irish boat guards.Han is frozen in carbonite and used as a trophy in the wall.   Jack is only frozen.Everybody knew that the ship was going to sink.   But who would've thought ""Luke, I am your father"".Han Solo would've dodge the stupid iceberg with no trouble.Carbon Fuel Vs. Energy Reactors ...... PLEEEAAASE!!!."
23078,False,"This is the truly dramatic meat of the trilogy-the one that pulled you into the lives of the rebels. The one that made their cause seem so desperate and so necessary that you just had to see them topple the Empire. An unseemly puppet named Yoda helped put this elaborate saga in historical perspective and brought depth  and mystery to the concept of ""The Force"" that was only touched upon in Star Wars. The genius of the trilogy(yes-it remains a trilogy until Lucas makes up for that Phantom Menace crap) is the way it effortlessly draws you in and immediately makes you forget you're watching a mere""movie"".  The Empire Strikes Back, more than any of the others, is responsible for bringing the whole drama of the saga into people's minds."
23079,False,"About the four movies, this is the most intense and dramatic of all the Star Wars Saga. Best of all is the revelations in the relation between Vader and Luke. The last sequence is one of the best in the story or movies.I hope that the Episode II would have the same intensity of this movie because take the place of a climax in the dramatic curve of the new trilogy."
23080,False,"I don´t think that I need to say many thing´s about this movie. It is simply the best one which was ever produced.I can only tell the people which haven´t still seen this movie: Take the time and watch this film, you won´t regret it. If I had the possibility, I would give eleven out of ten points, but unfortunately that´s not possible."
23081,False,"This film is the living example that there can be sequels which are even better than the original.While Star Wars A New Hope was a great movie, the saga was transported to a new level with this second part.The secret of this film's success might be the incredibly dark atmosphere, which is hardly ever interrupted. The movie starts bad for the Rebellion, turns for the worse and ends in an absolute disaster... and the heroes barely make it out alive.Aside from the story, the evil Darth Vader is at his best in this movie. Never again was he allowed to be so mean-spirited. ""Apology accepted, Captain Needa"" he snares as his failing officer lies dying on the floor.And we started to get an insight in this magic thing called ""the force"". Jedi Master Yoda has some splendid moments, and the essence of Luke Skywalkers Jedi training will always remain in my heart.Finally: The love scenes between Han and Leia... I am still awestruck when I see them again. I love the sequence on Bespin, the tragic farewell... in my eyes, this is one of the strongest moments of movie history. The music, the cinematography, the editing... and all this crowned by Hans Solos ""I know"" when Leia  utters that she loves him. Fantastic.If the second prequel can accomplish to be just half as good as this one, it will be really great! I demand a dark atmosphere film after the light (but enjoyable) ""Phantom Menace""."
23082,False,"The Empire Strikes Back is quite simply the best movie that I have ever seen.  The acting is well done, the story is captivating, the scenery is amazing.  The Empire Strikes Back begins after the original Death Star has been destroyed.  The Rebel Alliance is still, however being chased across the galaxy by the evil Galactic Empire.  In this episode, the relationship between Han Solo, the coolest freighter pilot ever, and Princess Leia is beginning to evolve into a love story, Darth Vader's master is at long last revealed, Yoda, the wise Jedi master is sought out by Luke Skywalker at the instruction of Obi-Wan, and Darth Vader makes an announcement that will forever change young Luke's life.  The lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke is one of my personal favorite action sequences in the Star Wars universe.  The Battle of Hoth is another memorable action scene where the Rebellion must defend their base against the Imperial forces.  I gave this movie a perfect 10, and hope that everybody goes out and rents it hundreds of times."
23083,False,"Empire is a soap opera.  It is a season finale that leaves you hanging for three years until the next one comes out ( fortunately for us that was 19 years ago and they are all out on video now ). And it is one of those movies that does something wonderful, it makes you feel something.  It grabs a hold of your emotions and twists your insides like a pretzel.  I rented this movie last night because just recently my own copy of it was stolen.  And let me tell you, the film still left me exhilarated, exhausted, full of hope, excited and yearning to watch Return of the Jedi so I can see how Han gets rescued and I so badly wanted to see Luke and Darth square off in that final battle.  But the one thing that this movie does perhaps like no movie has ever done is makes your heart stop."" No Luke, I am your father. ""We have all heard that line a thousand times before and we have all seen Empire a thousand more times, but no matter how old you are ( I'm in my late 20's ) and no matter how many times you hear it, it still sends chills through you.The Star Wars saga is pure magic and Empire is the best of the bunch.  I can't say enough about this film and of the whole series.  A New Hope, Empire, Return, and Phantom Menace are what movie making is all about and these movies do what films should do.  They take you to another place and they entertain you.  And there is no better film to do that than Empire. I really can't wait now for Episode 2.  2002 seems like it is an eternity away."
23084,False,"The Empire Strikes Back represents everything that I've come to expect from a film: Brave heroes, menacing villains, a well-written story, fantastic action scenes, a strong supporting cast, drama, romance, surprises, and a beautiful musical score. ""Empire"" focuses heavily on developing the characters from the first film, rounding out their personalities, and introduces several great new characters (Yoda, Lando Calrissian, Boba Fett). The special effects still hold up well to today's standards, the dialogue is witty and intelligent, and the character dynamic allows the actors to play well off of each other. It's a very different kind of film in that the ""good guys always win"" theory is proved wrong, and Darth Vader's surprise revelation at the end of the movie is still one of the best movie moments ever, which was shocking for its time. This is one of the few films that I find that never diminishes after each viewing. Even without the ""Star Wars"" name behind it, the amount of movie ""magic"" this film generates captivates me just as much now as it did when I was a child. This is a prime example of cinematic perfection, and in no way should be missed by anyone. A true classic and worthy of the ""10"" that I gave it."
23085,False,"The Empire Strikes Back is the absolute greatest Star Wars in the series. I am a huge Star Wars fanatic, and TESB has so much in it that makes it such a marvelous movie. It has the best action scenes (the excellent fight scene), the best story (Luke's training, the romance between Leia and Han), the best secrets revealed (""Luke, I am your father""), and the best suspense (Luke dangling from Cloud City). Everything about this movie is gold. It surpasses everything from the others (besides special effects of Ep. 1 and the fight scene from Ep. 1). I cannot find one thing bad or even mediocre from this film. Well, I actually can't find one thing bad about the others, except some scenes from Ep.1 and that huge sphere with the needle sticking out used to torture Leia in the Death Star in A New Hope. All in all, TESB is a magnificent movie which adds another plus in the phenomenal series."
23086,False,"THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK:Clearly the best among the three excellent ""STAR WARS"" movies. It is almost impossible to image any movie live up to this standard. So no matter how good the next three ""STAR WARS""-movies are going to be, this is the best a movie can get. Full of fantasy, action, romance and superb effects!!! A great story, a epic movie, created by a adventure-loving man, George Lucas, with and honest heart (and he is still making big money, big time)."
23087,False,"Like millions of people in the world, the Star Wars saga has filled me with great pleasure. George Lucas really managed to create a modern mythology. This story is eternal. I believe that the second chapter of the trilogy is the best film of the three. The Empire Strikes Back takes you and brings you far away, in a fantastic world, through a captivating adventure. What makes this film a masterpiece ? It is pure delight. The duel between Luke and Vader is memorable, it contains wonderful moments, particularly the one when Darth Vader tells Luke he is his father. The movie also introduces new characters, notably Yoda, the unforgettable Jedi master. The action sequences are really enjoyable. This movie is a summary of all the Star Wars magic. George Lucas has given the term ""entertainment"" a noble dimension. The force will be with him. Always..."
23088,False,"The rather dark of the original trilogy starts on the planet Hoth, an icy, cold planet where the Rebels have set up their base camp, and the Empire goes to destroy it.  After a really cool Snow Speeder vs. Imperial AT-AT and AT-STs, the movie takes an entirely different course from the first, and at the end, revealing a secretthat would rock Star Wars devotees worlds (as to what the secret is, we know it's that Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father). This ""episode"", not written by Lucas, but by Leigh Brackett, is, what some may call, the one that broke the rule.  That rule being that ""Sequels are never as good as the original.""  I'll admit, I differ from them slightly.  Toward the end, I found myself anxious for it to end (probably because I had to use the restroom).  Upon further viewing (and time alotted for restroom breaks), I found it much more enjoyable. The enstallment offers a lot more than the forementioned surprise, but it introduces several characters, a small, swamp dwelling Jedi Master named Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz), the sleazy ruler of the cloud city of Bespin, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), and a faceless bounty hunter, hired by Jabba the Hutt to capture Han Solo, named Bobba Fett.  This is truly a worthy installment in the Star Wars Trilogy. ARated PG for cartoonish violence and adult language"
23089,False,"The dramatic high point of the entire Star Wars saga remains the moment in Empire when Vader tempts a defeated Luke.  What Vader is offering is very enticing: come on kid lets you and me take over this universe.  There is also a genuine caring portrayed in Vader's voice.  There is a desperation in his words, like he realizes all he has for a legacy is his children. It's a brilliant scene, Lucas will never out-do it."
23090,False,"Among all the Star Wars films to date, you can't beat ESB for suspense and chills.  Impeccably written & shot.  Also, this film's lightsaber duel improves tremendously on the original's - go back & watch A New Hope, you'll be surprised at how awkward the Kenobi/Vader duel seems.  This film's duel is the first multi-level one, and the effects flow better.  Bring back Kershner to direct Episode II!!N.B.  The adding of cityscapes at Cloud City in some scenes of the Special Edition is a very nice touch."
23091,False,"I remember the first time I saw this. I saw the end. I thought it was so pointless. I watched it again. The whole movie blows you away. It's not often that a sequel lives up to a really great movie like Star Wars. Aliens is an example. This movie had great f/x and one really great script. Never see that in a sci/fi movie to often do you? The only boring parts are on the Hoth planet. And I love that part! The action scenes are put together very well. This is one of my favorite movie sequels. If you love Star Wars or sci/fi's or movies period, you should have this in your movie collection very soon. It's just one huge thrill ride. Take the ride too. The Empire Strikes Back: A"
23092,False,"Most of the time in movie history, sequels have been half-herted, never living up to the first movie. But that trend stopped in 1980 when (in my terms) the best sequel of all time: Empire Strikes Back. This movie shined on the evil Imperial forces shining, the Rebels fleeing, and romance building. It's a great movie to watch with the other 2 great films, or just by itself!"
23093,False,"This movie is the greatest of the original trilogy and in my eyes is second only to Star Wars: Episode 1 The Phantom Menace.  This installment has emotion, action, plot twists and is a pure joy to watch."
23094,False,"Better than Star Wars. Better than Return of the Jedi. And do you know why? Because it spends more time on character development and dramatic buildup than either of its siblings. While The Empire Strikes Back does include its share of space battles and lightsaber duels, the big focus isn't on special effects, but on relationships between characters. The heroes and villains are both developed in interesting ways, plus there's that surprise twist which you probably already know about, but which I won't risk spoiling for you.The Special Edition of this movie is also the best of the three. Except for the dopey, fake-looking Wampa-eats-a-Tantan-like-a-corncob scene, and the bloodcurdling scream that's been dubbed in when Luke throws himself into the bottomless ventilation shaft, most of the added/retouched stuff is pretty good. I was very impressed by what was done with Cloud City, and felt that it added greatly to those scenes. Darth Vader has a somewhat silly-sounding new line, but I liked the way the final chase scene was intercut with him flying back to the Star Destroyer.Definitely not the popcorn-gobbling big-screen videogame that Star Wars and Return of the Jedi are, but certainly superior to both in atmosphere, characterization, and execution."
23095,False,"Undoubtably the best of the triolgy, TESB explores more than just action sequences.  The story itself seems to flow and come alive more than the other two in the series because it deals with emotions and a deeper, more serious story of personal struggles.A little side note:  Personally TESB is the most creative, smart, and overall best film ever made."
23096,False,"Empire is probably my favorite movie of all time. While it might not be the best film, I can watch it over and over and over. The Empire Strikes Back define the characters and introduces us to some new ones such as Lando Calrissian and Boba Fett. The most important new character however is Yoda, a Jedi Master who reluctantly agrees to train Luke at Obi-Wan's request. Luke follows his path as student, while Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and C3-PO spend the movie trying to evade Vader and the Empire. When Luke senses Han and Leia are in danger he goes to confront Vader even when Voda instructs him not to. The movie is an all-time fave of mine and should be watched by everyone."
23097,False,"Stunning. ""Empire"" is a magnificent space opera with soaring visuals, enthralling music...and a magnetic spiritual compass. I must agree with those who find this the best SW film. And also agree with those who believe it is one of the BEST FILMS of any genre. It is the SW film that is most watchable over and over, for the sheer beauty and flow of the story. Without ""Empire"" the Star wars saga would be nothing but an over-hyper sugar ride video game. Admit it. This film IS the depth in the series."
23098,False,"The very first STAR WARS movie changed the way we looked at motion pictures, and this second feature is a BIG significant improvement. It is the best in the trilogy, hands down. Regardless of watching another mega-classic, I'm not going to write up a skyscraper-high comment for THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK because this only makes one-third of the legendary saga.It looks like we have another director in charge: Irvin Kirshner. But it is still George Lucas who's in full command. Key elements are (or were) beefed up to maximum ""force"", which is very noticable throughout. The simple layout of the story is still STAR WARS, now with a plot that thickens into greater epic dimensions. Continuing the story in motion is a brilliant thought. You just never call this a sequel! Characters have much more to their integrity than the previous film, with Yoda as a new addition. Luke Skywalker remains the powerful hero, but his interest with Yoda adds to his legacy along with the revealing truth about Darth Vader. Han Solo and Princess Leia have some touchy chemistry in-between the action (finally!). R2-D2 remains likeable, but you've got to look at C-3PO! What happened to him? We've come to know more about the cast, that is if you aren't careless to see EPISODE FIVE for the first time in your life.Like I said before, this next installment has much more. More speed, more intense combat battles, a more thundering orchestrated soundtrack by John Williams, and more special effects. Sights of objects that float in the air looked unbelievable (for the time). The biggest achievement goes to location filming under adverse conditions (the scene of Hoth), adding life to the story.George Lucas' script was of extreme brilliance in the first STAR WARS that only some further polishing would make his follow-up more revolutionary. Which is the one and only improvement in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Once again, please don't forget the Special Edition; no major movie classic has ever been updated in style thanks to Lucas' ILM team. Will EPISODE TWO live up to this?"
23099,False,"The story, the characters, the music, the situations, the special effects, the visuals-- Everything in this movie was pure genius! Every single second, every single frame of film is just stunning in my eyes. And with the Special Edition came a few new things that add to the magic.Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie along with Yoda light the screen with such a unique sense, something that few 90's movies seem to be able to capture. From the snowy 6th planet of the Hoth System, to the red sunset backdrop of Bespin, this movie lets your imagination wonder, and has caused me to write my own sci-fi play and seek a career in filmmaking.It's a shame that I know people that haven't seen any of the Star Wars movies, and in my heart lays a certain pity for them. Everyone alive and old enough to remember what they watch should few this film in awe. Definitely a million stars out of four."
23100,False,By far the best film of the series as well as my favorite movie of all time. There is nothing else out there that sucked me in as this movie did.
23101,False,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" brings back the original characters -- Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Darth Vader (who's really Luke's father), R2D2 and C-3PO --from ""Star Wars.""   The character development is much stronger than in the original ""Star Wars.""  We're introduced to Yoda, who helps Luke Skywalker (Mark Hammill) continue his Jedi training, even though the Emperor Palpatine insists that Luke ""must not become a Jedi."" Romance develops between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher).  Darth Vader (David Prowse) reveals his true identity to Luke while engaging in a duel with sabers. The special effects are even better. The ""Special Edition"" is just as good, but the  story does not change.  The ending leaves a few questions in mind that get answered in ""Return of the Jedi.""  My evaluation: **** out of ****."
23102,False,"I know you're probably tired of reading comments like this all the time, but it's true for me.  Admittedly, I'm kind of slanted towards this one, since this is one of my early childhood moviegoing memories, since my mom took my brothers and I to a really big theater in New Jersey to see it.  This film explores the central characters deeper without sacrificing thrills and excitement, and while it's a more obvious set-up for the next movie than the first one was, it's still got a good climax scene that allows you to take away something good.  Ford and Fisher are able to create something together too, and Mark Hamill comes off better than in either the first or third ones.  In the book I read on the STAR WARS movies, it said Lucas liked this least of all, but I think he's wrong."
23103,False,"The Empire Strikes Back is one of the films that breaks the rule about sequels. This film is just as good as Star Wars, and many people think it is better. I think Yoda is the key to the success of this film. You gotta love him. This film has more action in it as well as more humor. An absolute triumph. 10 points out of 10"
23104,False,George Lucas does it again with The Empire Strikes Back.  The full cast returns for a sequel that is better than the original.  The acting is great the effects are outstanding and story is wonderful.  The special edition is just as good. RATING = 10 of 10
23105,False,"This movie is the greater of the saga because it had a lot of suspense. In the special edition this suspense is greater (In Hoth;the Wampa scene,in Cloud City;the arrival of Darth Vader to the Star Destroyer) I was qualified with a 10 and give you the recommendation to see it."
23106,False,"Empire Strikes Back is the best movie in the trilogy and of all time.  With great acting, story script, plot, special effects, and directing, no wonder why it was so good.  I recommend this to those who haven't seen it."
23107,False,"This is a great sequel. This movie could actually be proven to be better than its original but then again there is no movie more original than star wars plus it made more money in theaters than the sequels but this movie is definitely worth watching and to anyone who hasnt seen it ""youre missing out"". This movies contains the best scene in the series which includes the part with the AT-AT walkers. The planet Hoth would never again be visited. Hopefully in the prequels to be we will see more of this but above all this is a great movie everyone should enjoy."
23108,False,"Most sci-fi fans, and just plain ol' SW fans agree:  This movie is the best of the original trilogy.  I have yet to see attack of the Clones, but if TESB is any indication AotC will be the best of the prequel trilogy.  The Empire Strikes back provides much more action than the first, and provides some much more interesting landscapes than Tatooine did.  Bespin provides a nice look into the technology and spledor of the SW universe.  The introduction of Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian pays off big, as the audience is given a better development of Han Solo.  In addition, the character development continues, and gives more insight into the desperation of the Rebel Alliance.  The Battle of Hoth is very well done, and easily outdoes the Battle of Yavin and the Battle of Endor.  If, for some reason you have been living on the moon for the past 22 years, SILENTLY get a copy and watch it, for the ending is one that no man should be told in advance. I unfortunately was born in 1984, and so by the time I was old enough to watch ESB, i knew of the ending's shocker.  The best SW movie is feinately one to cheerish and will live on forever in the SW saga."
23109,False,"The middle film of George Lucas' trilogy is by far the best film of the three. Eschewing the cheap look and near-campiness of Star Wars, and not having yet succumbed to the commercialzation and dearth of fresh ideas that is Return of the Jedi, Empire broadens Lucas' canvas in sweeping epic strokes and fully develops its dark, brooding themes. While Star Wars is an exercise in pure escapism, Empire takes its characters, and us, down a dark path. Consider: Luke is revealed to be Vader's son, Han and Leia begin a seemingly doomed romance, the rebellion lies in near ruin, Yoda and Obi-Wan believe Luke will fail at his quest -- and he does. I don't think are on Tatooine anymore, Artoo!"
23110,False,"Everyone ""knows"" that sequels are never as good as the original.THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is not only better than the original SW, it is much better. Characters who, in the original, had the depth of a puddle here develop and become human (or whatever). Incidents contribute to a well-rounded whole instead of being cool stuff stuck in simply because it would be cool. Even the far-too-obvious revelation (""I am your father, Luke"") comes at a time and in a way that humanizes the until then mechanically evil Vader.True, Lucas' patented blend of bland mysticism with portentous pronouncements is still present, now represented by a muppet rather than Alec Guinness: but even that has been turned to the service of the story. The training of the hero has become more than a blend of fortune-cookie wisdom and how to hold your weapon; we see it as the difficult, painful, and frustrating thing it _must_ be, and in so seeing, we see Luke as a potential hero and not the dumb hick he was throughout the first film. (He's still largely a dumb hick, but he's a dumb hick with some experience under his belt and some serious potential as a human being.)Of the three ""classic"" SW films, this is the one that most deserves to be seen on a big screen. After discounting for the way-cool special effects (which, even after the recent refurbishing, are still nothing to write home about in the late 1990s, amazing though they were twenty years ago), EMPIRE has far and away the most visual impact of the three. From the stark expanses of the iceworld at the beginning to the terrifying climactic sequence with the injured Luke hanging by one hand from the bottom of the cloud city, the whole screen is used to good effect to bring the viewer visually and, more important, viscerally into the action."
23111,False,"I am going against the grain here, but I thought this was actually the weakest and least ""Star Wars"" like of the ""Star Wars"" films. It feels very confined to me. Where are the sweeping visuals? Cloud City is the most exotic locale and even that is pretty sterile looking (although it was helped GREATLY with the ""Special Edition""additions). I like the darker tone of it but there's just not enough going on here in terms of action. That said, it's still a great movie and one of my favorites, but it's my least favorite of the saga so far."
23112,False,"Being a huge star wars fan and having seen the movies a bajillion and 1 times, I have to say this one was the most well rounded. It had suspense, romance, action, comedy and special effects that still stand up to todays standards. It also had one of the biggest suprises in movie history. Anyone who heard ""Luke I am your father"" for the first time came out of the theater completely blown away... I know I did. The movie is just brilliant. To me, Mr. Lucas just did everything right."
23113,False,"The year is 1980.  With ""Star Wars"" already engrained into popular culture shortly after its release (much like ""The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"" is today), fans were left to ponder what the sequel could offer. Three years after the release of the original, they found out.  ""The Empire Strikes Back"" delivers a strong emotional punch.  Unlike its predecessor however it is not an uplifting and feelgood film.  Far from it in fact. ""Empire"" is a dark, brooding and somewhat surreal film, bristling with conflict and drama.  As a result it stands head and shoulders above its prequels and sequel.We join the Rebel Alliance possibly five or so years since the destruction of the Death Star.  Despite their victory, the Empire continues to close in. Retreating to the ice planet of Hoth, the Rebels are on the run.  A hugely impressive Imperial Starfleet nears Hoth under the leadership of Darth Vader.  Obsessed with locating young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) Vader is unrelenting in his pursuit.  Urged on by the knowledge that Skywalker represents a shift in the balance of the Force, Vader vows to either destroy the boy or turn him to the Dark Side to benefit himself and the Emperor.Meanwhile Luke himself has grown up, if only slightly, since his accomplishments in the first film.  More aware of his uncanny power, Luke feels the Force now but cannot control its impulses.  His talent is raw and under the advise of the apparition of Obi Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness), Luke is instructed to learn from Yoda, a great Jedi Master on the planet of Degobah.As the Empire invades Hoth we are treated to an impressive ground battle. Making use of the wads of money available to him at the time, Lucas and director Irvin Kershner commit to a great deal of stop motion camerawork, with the AT-AT walkers and Snowspeeders in combat.  Even today, 22 years since ""Empire"" was released, it still impresses.  We also witness the first sparks of romance between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher).  Their character development in this film outweighs their contribution in the sequel ""Return of the Jedi"", but it works perfectly here.The Empire is presented as a powerful but incompetent and bickering military machine, with officers destroyed at Vader's whim.  Impatient and lacking any tolerance whatsoever, Vader is infuriated at the inability of his highest ranking officers.  The Empire seems to fulfill the notion of trying to crack a walnut with a steamroller: powerful but ineffective.The film's dark and eerie tone takes off when Luke arrives on Degobah.  A huge swamp of animal, plant and supernatural life, Degobah is an embodiment of the Force.  After crashlanding his X Wing Fighter, Luke wishes to locate Yoda.  Impatient and complaining, Luke is shocked to find a small creature who he originally dismisses as a pest actually IS Yoda.  Mindful of Luke's age and impatience, Yoda is reluctant to train him.  Obi Wan Kenobi's spirit urges Yoda to try.  He agrees and Luke's training begins.  Luke is tested beyond his mental and spiritual beliefs under Yoda's guidance as he faces his ultimate fear and the possible confirmation of his dark beliefs.
The Yoda character (a puppet performed by Frank Oz), is at once cute and believable.  His wisdom is beyond comprehension and his ability to conduct and feel the Force is illustrated brilliantly.  Add in John Williams' ""Yoda's Theme"" and you have the makings of one of the more memorable of all characters in the saga.Aware of his abilities to see the past and the future, Luke envisions the possible death of Han and Leia as they are double-crossed after seeking asylum.  Torn between finishing his training and saving his friends, Luke leaves Degobah to save them.  Little does he know their suffering is nothing more than a trap set by Darth Vader on the Cloud City of Bespin.Luring him in, Vader challenges Luke.  Fans of the original lightsabre duel between Obi Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader will get blown away here.  The battle still remains the best of all duels in the saga, with the ultra powerful Vader manipulating the young but strong Luke.  Set in the dark hues of black, blue and grey their lightsabre fight and its subsequent shock conclusion make ""Empire"" truly memorable.The film's ending is left wide open and ready for ""Return of the Jedi"" as the viewer leaves the film uncertain but eager for more.  The special effects and set and costume design remains superb and the floating menace of the Empire's Starfleet is more awe inspiring and terrifying than the original's Death Star.  The dark tone of this film is replaced by a warmer feel in ROTJ, but it is the power and dramatic tension that makes this film the best of the ""Star Wars"" saga so far."
23114,False,"A sequel better than the original. Excellent for so many reasons. Good performances, effects that still hold up 20 years (+) on. However it is the story that wins it for me. The good guys get defeated midway through the film after which the heroes get chased until they are caught and then tortured and imprisoned. Their saviour then comes only to need saving himself. Fantastic and a killer cliff hanger. This is a film about a relentless villain with a purpose and without the gore, absolutely fantastic. The only fault is that the writer/producer and director were not there for the films since, now that would have been worthwhile........"
23115,False,"Sequels are rarely as good as the films that spawned them- but THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (thanks to the direction of Irvin Kershner) proves the exception to the rule. Mature and thoughtful in a way the first film never was (though still chock full of the kinds of critters and fx that most fans of the original took to), this first sequel remains the best (by far) to date. For once in this series, the viewer feels s/he's in the hands of a genuine STORYTELLER. While Lucas himself may have written the script, it's Kershner who gives EMPIRE life, whose taut direction lifts what might've been just another also-ran sequel to a much higher plane than the original ever attained. (For every step forward, there is a step backward: the next film in the series would turn out to be the worst of the lot.)"
23116,False,"Hoth is great - asteroids are great - space slug is great - Yoda is one of the best original characters ever in a movie - Vader is a real bastard - Lando ""colt 45"" Calrissian and Boba ""he's no good to me dead"" Fett take charge of cloud city -- Leia and Han fall in love - Luke gets all sweaty during the training - best lightsaber duel of the three flicks -- ""how you doin' chewbacca, still hanging around with this loser?"" -- 3po gets shot and r2 saves the day at least three times again --  THIS MOVIE IS THE REASON LIFE CAN BE SO GRAND - the trilogy has given me and many others endless hours of happiness. A gem. 10 out of 10."
23117,False,After seeing the first one you knew they would have a continuation.  So far they have kept up with the latest installments of the starwars episodes. Empire strikes Back is in my book the greatest continuation of any sequence. Of course other sequences got tens but this over excels in everything. The special effects in the movie seem like they could have been made in the 90's. One things for sure this series of movies gets more publicity than any other movie events.
23118,False,"Everyone has his or her favorite movie. Sometimes, over the years, you forget why you actually named it ""your favorite"" at one point in your life, and you nurture it, defend it against evil-doers and just let it stay up there, up on the top of your best-list. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is mine, my favorite movie. It might have its flaws but I don't even want to talk about them. Nor about its greatness. It just is.Will it ever be de-throned? Well, competition has come and gone, and after seeing somewhere around 10 000 movies in my life, I'm still at the point where I say ""no, there's no other"". I still hope for a movie to top it. I hoped ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" would be that movie and although it's a 10/10-masterpiece, it doesn't come close to the timelessness of ""The Empire Strikes Back"". So I keep on waiting. Until then ... this is mine, my precioussssss ...Rating 10/10"
23119,False,In my opinion the six hour plus epic of episode IV through VI of Star Wars are the best movies of all time.  To separate them would not give them justice because it really is one incredible story.  I find the acting to be surprisingly good from mostly relative unknowns and they make the story so much better.  The feeling of depth to this story is what really sets it apart and it is so incredibly entertaining.  The special effects are mind boggling for their time and are still great today.  I love this movie because it made me want to be part of this universe and dream about being there.  The score has to be by the best I have ever had the pleasure to hear and the visuals are amazing.  For  entertainment I can't find any better movie than these.
23120,False,"I love the pacing of this movie, great twist at the end....beautifully directed by Kershner, the best SW movie to date....and will probably stay that way....Hopefully Lucas will learn from great mixture this movie has, to not make another mistake like the Phantom Menance again......"
23121,False,"This one is exelent and almost as good as A New Hope.  The only thing that brought it down for me was the fact that it was so depresing. In this one the Rebles have been driven onto a remote planet called Hoth. The Impeials find the base and lay seige to it.  Luke Skywalker (Mark Hammiel) gose to Dagobah to complete his jedi training by master Yoda (Frank Oz), while Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mahew), and C3P-O (Anthony Daniels) flee to Cloud City which is owned by an old ""friend"" of Han's, Lando Calrision (Billy Dee Wiliams).  The climax much more intense than the last (so is the rest of the movie). Again exelent preformances by Mark Hammiel, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Billy Dee Williams, along whith the rest of the cast.  Again George Lucus is an exelent story-teller. This isn't as good as the last just because it's so dark.  I give Star Wars Episode 5 The Empire Striks Back 10/10"
23122,False,"Although it is not the happiest of the 3 Star Wars films (I'm not even considering the pseudo-Star Wars rubbish Lucas is putting out now to pre-cursor the greatest trilogy ever concieved), it is my fav.  Perhaps it is the films darkness that make it slightly better than the other 2.  I have never watched a film more times and hoped for a differnet outcome than this one.  Everytime I see it I hope that somehow Luke chooses to stay with Yoda and finish his training.  Anyway.  Best of the 3, no doubt."
23123,False,"First,I'd like to add two things. I don't think that the whole Star Wars trilogy is an unique masterpiece, but then ESB belongs to my favourite movies. Why? While Episode 4 needs almost an hour to speed up and Episode 6 puts too much emphasis on little cute furballs, ESB is quite different from them. The atmosphere is dark and desperate, the plot as well as the characters are worked out perfectly in this part. Here we find most of the things which made that huge impact of Star Wars on our culture; John William's Imperial March, the first (and more impressive) appearance of Yoda and of course the legendary lightsaber duel at the end- when I think of Star Wars, it's ESB I remind. So there are two things to say:If you don't know the Saga, watch all three of them in the right order but don't give up after the first one, ESB will probably change your mind if you thought it was too childish. And then, may the force be with George Lucas to make Episode 1 look like Empire Strikes Back."
23124,False,"The Imperial Walkers approaching the Hoth Base is the greatest opening scene in the history of sci-fi/action/epics. Empire is nearly as good as the first and the score is equally good. It remains my 2nd ""most watched"" movie and probably always will. This, in my opinion, is probably the only one of the 3 originals to benefit from the ""special editions"". The ""Wampa"" scenes are much improved. Incredible on the big screen. There should be a movie house somewhere that only shows Star Wars movies...all day...every day. Maybe Lucas could put that in his will? What do you think? I give it 10/10."
23125,False,"Good Points:  Everything that made the first Star Wars movie great is in abundance in Empire Strikes Back.  The mood is darker than the first film and not quite so fairy-tale-ish, and it's nice to see the good guys get their butts kicked for a change.  Also, here the characters develop further than in the first film which shows that Lucas was pacing things nicely for what was to become a trilogy.  And who could ignore the special effects? Those wizards of eye candy, Industrial Light and Magic, which formed out of the first movie, deliver some incredible visuals that are still fun to watch even today.Bad Points:  Very little to complain about here.  Honestly, I can't think of a single thing I didn't like about the movie.Bottom Line:  A great sci-fi classic just like the first one.  If you liked A New Hope, you'll love Empire."
23126,False,"Declaring The Empire Strikes Back to be the best of the Star Wars Trilogy is not a unique opinion.  But then it clearly is the best, even allowing for the fact that without episodes 4 and 6 the whole thing would make little sense.Ultimately it is the deepest and darkest of the three films, with impressive Character development, especially Luke on his Jedi training and the gradual blossoming of the relationship between Leia and Han.  Comic relief comes in the golden form of C3P0 always ready to regale his human superiors with some paranoid babbling about the perils of evading the Empire.Some may think that there is more talking than the other films but then that's the price you pay for plot development, more of this would have been nice in Phantom Menace. The big revelation that Vader is Luke's father turns the triology on it's head. Yet with the Snow Battle, the asteroid chase, the manic storming of the bridge of a Star Destroyer and the Light Sabre conflict between Luke and Vader in the dark recesses of Cloud City we are hardly being short changed of high budget Hollywood action.The inconclusive finale may have been somewhat may have caused a little frustration back in 1980 but that is part of the films strength, meaning it can play out it's plot and character development without having to hurry the story to fit in with the confines of one movie.The Empire Strikes Back is by no means brain surgery, though for elegant science fiction thrills and visionary fantasy with just enough humour you can't go wrong."
23127,False,"""The Empire Strikes Back"", if not the best film ever made, is merely the best Star Wars film ever made. I seriously doubt Lucas will top this. Ever. The way the story is told continues to astound me. The darkness of it all. The adventure, danger, and drama that consists in the film's universe has yet to be paralelled (I don't it will be). In terms of acting, its pretty well orchestrated. In terms of special effects, it's amazing. In terms of music, it has some of Williams' best. In terms of script, it's wonderous (at least after the ""laser-brain"" scene). In terms of story, it's the best. In terms of characters? Well, lets just say it's uncanny. The way the characters unfold in their adventures and the true revealing of Vader's mind is fascinating. The film won't please impatient kids all that much. It is a mature movie through and through. Not in terms of content, but in terms of understanding. There's no Jar Jar, Jawas, or Ewoks in this one. The title explains it all and the end result leaves one in a semi-depressed stupor while also giving the viewer a sense of hope. Everything works in this one somehow, whether it's the story, locations, characters (Boba Fett and Yoda, for example), music, or awesomesness of the villains. It all accumulates into one word: fantastic.    10/10!"
23128,False,"TEMSB has to be one of the greatest sequels ever made. The action, special effects are all better, the storyline is much darker and the pacing is great. I remember going to see this movie back in Januray of 1997 and loving it. I got the feeling you're supposed to get when you see a Star Wars flick, excitement. I just wish they would release it on DVD."
23129,False,"In creating a sequel to the phenomenally successful Star Wars, George Lucas and his team were faced with a seemingly impossible challenge.  How could the original be surpassed?  Three years (and a lot of cash) had, of course, given the film-makers the opportunity to develop the special effects technology far beyond the original film.  But this alone was not enough. Where Empire truly excels over it's predecessor is in the two essential fields of film storytelling-- both the plot and the characters are far richer and more captivating.  Why is Empire the greatest film ever made? We will never again see such a perfect blending of romance, adventure, emotion and movie magic."
23130,False,"'Empire' truly ranks as one of the sequels that surpasses the original and leaves us hanging for another. My mind goes back to when I saw this at age six, being totally mesmerized by the battle of Hoth that found my hands in a continuous rewind/play cycle. Kudos to Phil Tippett for excellent work on the AT-ATs. My only disappointment with the film was that little of Dagobah's ""massive life form readings"" were shown other than snakes and lizards. The Empire keeps striking back!"
23131,False,"This takes the cake.  It runs away where it's prequel stopped.  We find out who everyone is, we see the dark side a lot more, and of course Yoda, Boba Fett, and the greatest uses of color ever in a film.  Amazing ending. Never ending entertainment, and most of all, a dark ending that leaves you begging for more.  The greatest."
23132,False,"Simply the best movie ever--enough said.  It is brilliant because there is no cheese, the humor is not forced, the action paces perfectly with dialogue, the musical score is superb, and it ends abruptly and surprisingly.  No Death Stars, quirky alien creatures, or bad lines where added, which made for some of the most heartfelt and emotional scenes in the history of filmmaking.  This is space opera as it was meant to be--where the fat that the film takes place in space is not the overriing theme, but rather a question of good and evil with complicated, graying, adult questions (Is Vader Luke's Father? Does Leia love Han? Is Lando a traitor? Are Ben and Yoda being truthful/helpful to Luke?)  Watch this again and again and again."
23133,False,"I love this film with all of my heart.  The power of the story telling, and the visuals are both awesome.  Every shot is beautifully put together, and I cant help but get swept away with the story.  The climactic ending is superb, giving the film a very dark tone.  The superb direction, and the fantastic star wars universe combined make this an absolute classic, and even the original looks slightly paled in comparison.  If you haven't seen this film already, do so!"
23134,False,Best movie of the best series of movies ever.  I challenge anyone to find a better villain in any movie than Darth Vader in this movie.  And it was the birth of Boba Fett.  Classic scenes between Han and Leia.  And C3PO comes out from R2D2's shadow.  Best movie ever... I think.
23135,False,"This is a little bit darker than the first one and it´s a little bit better.this is one of the best action/adventures ever made.I have watch this movie many times and it´s still as good as when you watch it the first time.
10/10"
23136,False,"There's not much to say about this film that wasn't said in ""Clerks"". But I do have to say that it is very difficult to make a sequel better than the original and Empire surely did that. In many ways it is the very example of what a sequel should be; something that carries the characters further and in a more serious direction without loosing the feel of the original.  That is, of course, the main problem with The Phantom Menace. It completely looses the mood of all of the previous films.  Empire is dark, rich, and a wonderful piece of work to watch."
23137,False,"What can I tell about this Fifth episode of the so famous trilogy of Star Wars! This part contains a big dramatic aspect (with the Lando affair and the run after Han) that gives so much feeling. You want to cry to kill the bad Lando, to Scream like Chewbacca and to say with Luke ... ""No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!"".  I think any of Star Wars episode provide so much of feeling than ESB and that's why It is MY best episode of that Star Wars trilogy of mine. Hope that episode 2 and 3 will be of that quality!"
23138,False,"The original Star Wars was a great movie in it's own right, but the sequel blew that out of the water!! Empire was and still is, so far, the best Star Wars installment to grace our big screens. The plot line was superb and really made for a hell of a ride for us to enjoy. The character development in this movie, from Han to Leia, Luke to Vader, Lando to Han, etc. was perfect. The special effects were taken to a all new level of intensity (the Hoth battle is still one of the best battle sequences ever--real or not). And John Williams' score is phenomenal.
It is very rare for any movie to make this claim, but Empire is one of the few sequels that out shines its predecessor. I think one of the reasons I also like Empire so much is the fact that it gave the Star Wars universe a much more grittier and darker tone. Darth Vader really became one of cinemas greatest bad guys in this. And Boba Fett was quite the bad ass mercenary/bounty hunter.Another reason I believe Empire is so much more popular and better than the rest of the trilogy is due to the fact it has a very emotional side to it. This gives the viewer a chance to become more closely involved with all the characters. I strongly recommend Empire for anyone that enjoys movies that make you cheer for the good guys, jeer for the bad guys (or cheer, I still love Vader!!) and gives you an overall great movie experience. Empire is definitely a classic of our time."
23139,False,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" is not just the best installment so far in the ""Star Wars"" saga, it is arguably one of the best sci-fi films of all-time. This is what science fiction and fantasy films are all about.
I won't bother too much with the story line, since most people (especially film fans) know all about the ""Star Wars"" films. After watching the film again recently, I had to just sit and admire the other worlds brought before our eyes... Hoth, the frozen planet... Dagobah, the swamp planet, and of course Cloud City. This film is a feast for the eyes, like so many great sci-fi films such as ""Metropolis"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". The skyline of Cloud City and the sights and sounds of the Dagobah and its creatures are enough to make you smile in awe of the other worlds brought before our eyes.The other factor in the film which makes it such an effective piece of emotional entertainment, is the relationships. The audience is allowed to identify and feel for the characters through these relationships. The romance of Han (Harrison Ford and Leia (Carrie Fisher), the conflict between Luke and Darth Vader as well as the friendship formed between Luke and Yoda make for an enjoyable and interesting slice of entertainment. This film puts its characters in both complicated and tough situations and in many cases leaves them hanging (with responses coming in ""Return of the Jedi""), but this is what gives the film its creativity and power. This is a great sci-fi film and the best so far in the ""Star Wars"" saga. A 10 out of 10."
23140,False,"All the Star wars episodes are great, but this is the best one. This is actually the best movie that has ever been made.  At least in my opinion."
23141,False,"Of the Star Wars franchise, this film is the best directed, has the best cinematography, and has the best score.  Irvin Kershner has been noted on not seeing ""eye-to-eye"" on some directorial decisions with George Lucas. From what I understand, George likes (at least in 1979) to keep camera direction simple and did not like to set up complex camera shots.  Irvin uses the moving camera very well and very subtly.  The cinematography is also beautiful.  My favorite sequence of all the SW films is the final lightsaber dual.  This is so well directed and lit with the contrasting blues and oranges intermixed that it really comes to life.  The score is one of John William's best.  Here you have so many themes.  My favorite is Vader's theme embedded within the asteroid sequence.  What I don't like about the film is the climax resolution of the film.  R2-D2 makes a minor adjustment, just in the nick of time and saves the ship.  The only thing lamer is ending the ending to the Phantom Menace."
23142,False,I think this is the best film ever made; the music is magnificant and the special effects are the top of the bill (of that AGE). I will always remember my idol -Darth Vader- ;he is the best. In this film you can also see the might of the empire and the power of the dark site. It's my top-movie.
23143,False,"This movie includes the greatest scene of all time: The ""I am your father"" bit. After watching it several times, it still shocks me and moves me to tears... The plot is the most intriguing and exiting of the episodes of The Star Wars saga."
23144,False,"'The Empire Strikes Back' is the best of the 'Star Wars'-movies to date. There's something special about this episode, it has something that the other episodes hasn't. I can't say what it is, really. It's just so...I must say that the Hoth-battle against the imperial 'walkers' is probably the best action-sequence ever been filmed."
23145,False,"Stuck right in the middle of the revolutionary opening chapter, ""A New Hope"" and the action-packed finale ""Return of the Jedi"" came this much darker, more involving tale.  ""The Empire Strikes Back"" takes a slower and more thoughtful approach as young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is told by his former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi to travel to the Dagoba system, in the far reaches of the galaxy, to find Kenobi's own Jedi master, Yoda. 
At the same time as he is receiving this information, the Imperial Army is bearing down upon the ice planet of Hoth, where the Rebel Alliance have set up base.  Leia (Carrie Fisher)and the other leaders of the Alliance order an immediate evacuation but they are not quick enough and a huge battle breaks out, plunging the base into chaos.  Amidst all this confusion, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his reliable co-pilot Chewbacca are trying to make their own bid for freedom and plan to leave the Alliance behind to make their fortune elsewhere.  As chaos sets in on the base, Leia and droid C-3PO end up on board Solo's Millennium Falcon and they make their bid for freedom unsure of their destination.  Meanwhile, Luke and R2-D2 have crash-landed on Dagoba and find it to be a dank, unpleasant swamp crawling with all manner of insects and strange wildlife.  Luke finds Yoda eventually, but he is not what he expected at all.  All the same he is willing to be taught and Yoda begins to train him in the ways of the Force so that he too may become a Jedi. 
Meanwhile, on the run from Darth Vader and the Imperial Army, Solo decides to visit an old friend of his, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) who in fact, lost the Millennium Falcon to Solo on a bet some years earlier. However, despite the initial welcome, disaster follows and Luke is forced to halt his training halfway through to try and resolve the situation...Very dark in tone and aimed less at the children than the other episodes, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" ranks as one of the finest science-fiction films ever made, building on the outstanding special effects of ""A New Hope"" and also vastly improving the plot.  The acting, of course, is top notch and who could ever forget that mind-blowing ending?  Lucas may not have been in the director's chair for this one but it doesn't mean the film is any less worthy than the original, it surpasses it in terms of story, character development and enjoyment.  Perhaps the most critically acclaimed episode, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is certainly the most influential and significant piece of the puzzle.  Fantastic."
23146,False,"Of all the movies that have had follow-ups to the original, many just had sequels made only because the first was successful enough for it.  First thing to know: ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is NOT a sequel.  A standard ""sequel"" is simply the same or similar characters from one movie put in the same or similar situation to the one of the original movie, which is complete without any sequel (Jurassic Park, Speed).  ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was pre-planned, and while ""Star Wars"" did seem like a complete story by itself, that was a result of creator George Lucas' uncertainty of whether or not they'd be given the opportunity to complete his saga of stories. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" did an excellent job as the film following ""Star Wars: A New Hope"", because it strived toward the same excellence the first one achieved, while the mood of this chapter contrasted that of the first entirely.  The first one definitely had a lighter sort of mood to it, as far as the action among the rebels.  This film concentrates more on the war itself, and how tough it is on the rebellion.  It also has more establishment of the imperials and their ruthlessness, which definitely adds a darker tone to it.  Score composer John Williams helps give this feeling to the film, with the now famous Imperial March that is so closely associated with villain Darth Vader (James Earl Jones).  For a mood this dark, there sure is a lot of really nice scenery in the film, from the glaciers of the planet Hoth to the spanning cloudscape of Bespin.  The special effects remain as amazing as those in ""A New Hope"", and have been re-done with a ""Special Edition"" as well as the first one, although not as much has changed in this film.  The acting is also just as good as it was in the first one, with the addition of Yoda (Frank Oz) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams).  The emotion of this film definitely surpasses those in ""A New Hope"", with the characters' personalities and relationships explored more deeply, such as between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), and even Luke (Mark Hamill) and Darth Vader, who for the first time have an actual face-to-face confrontation with each other in the unforgettable lightsaber duel.  This film is even more suspenseful and action-packed, with an incredible climax and other very high points as well. Of all the intense and breathtaking aspects of this film, the one that everyone has remembered since, and will be remembered for as long as ""Star Wars"" itself, is the revelation by Vader to Luke, which most people already know by now.  If you are one of the very few who don't, don't do anything until you see this film (and the first one, too) and find out from the movie, not from some loud-mouthed friend, the way many of us did.  As hard as it would be to make a film as great as ""A New Hope"" after it changed the standards of filmmaking forever, this film definitely meets and surpasses the first one.  It will also leave you hanging for the trilogy's final film, ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983), which also does not disappoint in any way.  A SECOND must-see for science fiction fans, or movie fans in general."
23147,False,"Just saw the special edition of this movie again last night after a few years, and I'm still amazed by it.  Easily the darkest and most dramatic of the star wars films (and the best), highlights include the opening hoth battle, the asteroid belt chase and the final lightsaber dual between Luke and Vader.  The special edition actually adds to cloud city, making it seem much larger and open and enhances its feeling.   The added wompa creature scenes are not as effective, but do not really detract from the film.The look of the film really sticks with you, especially on Degobah and Cloud City...great lighting, angles in the scene where Han Solo is frozen in carbonite.  Best work by John Williams in the trilogy as far as music goes too...""Empire theme"" ranks with ""ride of the valkyries"" in apocalypse now as a power anthem.Only part that slightly bugs is when the millennium falcon is docked in the worm's stomach on the asteroid and the ""minocs"" appear (it goes for amateurish ""startle"" scares like in a corny slasher flick) but otherwise an awesome movie. A perfect 10."
23148,False,"The most accomplished film of the whole Star Wars series. Not only is the plot more interesting-darker and technically intriguing-but for once in the Star Wars prequels, the performances are interesting and have at least enough depth to complement the plot.If you have not seen the film, do not read on!! Many set pieces within the film spring to mind, most noteably the battle on Hoth, where the whiteness invades the screen creating a beautiful visceral backdrop for the jaw dropping action. And, of course the revelation that Darth Vader is Luke's Father. Not only is this as big a twist as an avid film fan will find anywhere in film history, but the lightsaber battle involving Father and Son excites and involves the viewer like few movie head to heads ever screened.Overall, it excels Episode IV on plot (although the original lays out the blue prints) and performances, and although Jedi presents us with some phenomenal showboating from Lucas, I simply have to prioritise Empire for it's blackness, it's humour and it's ability to actually involve you with the characters."
23149,False,"The Empire Strikes Back has got to be the best sequel film thus far in motion picture history. The main thing that makes it stand out is the fact that it is very dark and different like Citizen Kane. Han & Leia's love/hate relationship is a great detail among the many other great details in the film.We also have that great score that produced the powerful ""Imperial March"" which is one of the most recognizable pieces of music ever composed. Along with that in the score is other great climatic music. Too bad they gave the Oscar to that dude who composed the score for Tess. I wasn't too impressed with that one.Then there are the sound effects. They were a bit ahead for the time and very interesting. Ben Burt is a technical mastermind.Then we also have a great cast. Granted most of the actors/actresses were reprising roles, but they still did well. I for one am a bit disappointed Billy Dee Williams wasn't nominated for an Academy Award for playing Lando, but I also understand not everyone can be nominated.Hopefully Episode II will bring some of the elements from Episode V to make up for Jar-Jar in Episode I. Have a nice day! =)"
23150,False,"I could say so much about how great this movie is but will instead recommend that anyone with an interest in film watch one of the greatest scenes ever: the carbon freezing scene.  Everything is perfect in that scene from the patience Kershner has to let the emotion build, to the incredible use of music, to the cinematography.  It is a scene where almost no dialogue is spoken and yet more emotion is conveyed from each character present than perhaps any other scene ever put on film.  For a director to achieve such an effect with no dialogue is the mark of a truly great directing.  Every film student should study it frame by frame. There is no way George Lucas could have filmed that scene and thank god he didn't try."
23151,False,"Easily the best of the Star Wars movies, and definitely one of the best movies ever made. There's not much that I can say about this picture that hasn't already been said, so I'll simple say this: you'll enjoy this movie from start to finish!"
23152,False,"As the title suggests, this is my favorite among the series. I think this episode is the best in creating the conflicts between the good/bad and Darth Vader/Luke. Also it has more astonishing space-travel/fight scenes than any other episodes, which all seem less creative by comparison. The original Star Wars (episode IV) is a prototype, and this is a polished gem! All in all, this is one of my all-time favorite sci-fi movies. I give it a 10!"
23153,False,"This part of the saga is the only way to understand the truly significance of the force. Because there are not Midichrolians, only the way of the master and his pupil. Only the words of an ancient teacher. Only the force and the dark side.For me, the best film yet(let´s hope Episode II and III do anything about it)"
23154,False,"Although it is argued that 'A New Hope' was more original and revolutionary (Which it is), I believe that 'Empire' is a better film. While the first film touches on Luke's destiny, in 'Empire' Luke begins to see the potential of his power, and also sees the temptation of the dark side. Where this film succeeds where the others fail is in the psychology of the film. Luke realises that his own worst enemy is himself, not Vader. Vader too is given far more scope in this film. We see his full range of his powers, his relationships with Imperial Officers, and more importantly with the Emperor. The climax of the film (Which I won't give away, just in case you've been living under a rock since 1980), ties up a lot of loose ends and intertwining stories from the film. Ultimately it sets up a great start for the final part of the trilogy (Unfortunatley it wasn't lived up to). A very solid 9/10"
23155,False,"One of the best movies I have ever seen, a world of fantasy and high ideals which inspired many......a classic.Because of the ""transcendental"" scenes of this movie(like the ones of Luke's training on Dagobah), I rate this the best Star Wars movie. Also the resourceful action scenes and the landscapes are very cool.The movie has sort of practical philosophy without many pretenses full of optimism and life which is very appealing."
23156,False,"With as much magic and inspiration as ""Star Wars"", the sequel continues the wonderful saga. With the same effort, the same fascinating characters and the same fantastic vision, it's hard to fail. This one is even better than episode IV, but feels very much like a wait for episode VI, the very best in the saga. Still - it's inspiring, enlightening and entertaining to watch...over and over again."
23157,False,"George Lucas was a brilliant writer.  He knew how take the age old plot line of an ordinary boy becoming a legendary hero, through the trials of life, death and romance.  He topped it off by giving it a futuristic, science fiction twist.  Between the three of his movies this one was the best.  It developed the viewer's perception of the Empire and how rotten and evil it truly was.  It developed Darth Vader's character into something that would make us shudder just hearing him breath.  It clarified this mysterious power called the ""force.""  It contained outstanding battle scenes, on land, in space and man to man.  Finally, it set up our curiosity about Jabba the Hutt and the Emperor himself.  This had to be best movie of all time.  I wasn't big on Lucas' additions to the originals, but he managed not to tamper too much with this one."
23158,False,"""Star Wars: A New Hope"" was above and beyond the best movie of all time when it came out. And it is known that sequels are not often worth the tape they're printed on. But ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"" proved that wrong.In some opinions, it was even better that the first. The story deepens, and we feel even more for the characters. And who can forget ""No, I am your father."" It rocked the world. Though it is the most misquoted line in cinema history next to ""Play it again, Sam.""This movie was great. I could watch it every day. Anyone who doesn't at least appreciate it must have an IQ lower than their age. And it didn't stop there. George Lucas continued with ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"" which couldn't have followed a better story. Stellar. Pure Cinema."
23159,False,"This is Darth Vader's movie.  We find out why he is the number 2 man(?) in the galaxy.  He's ruthless, insightful, powerful, ambitious, and devious. Most importantly, we find out why he is so evil--he wants to take over the galaxy!  His ambitions are no different than the rebel's, except he wants to be emperor.  He doesn't care about Han, Laeia, Chewbacca, or the rebels--they are just pawns in his ambitious game to depose the emperor.  Of course in episode VI, we find out where his true sympathies lie.Darth is marvelously delicious in this film."
23160,False,"with this masterpiece of the Star Wars saga, which in my opinion is the best part of the whole series. I always thought that way and I guess that will never change. Of course I got some criticism, but it is basically the same I have for Episode IV and that would be that the special effects seem not as good as they once did, which is basically due to the enormous change and improvement on the special effects department. Besides that though I do not have any criticism on this film. As with the other Episode I also am talking about the Special Edition here and I must say that Lucas has done some good improvement with this Episode as well. There were a bunch of altered or added effects, like explosions and a few scenes in the city in the clouds, but the part that was altered best, I think, was the one in the beginning involving the creature in the snow. There were really some good scenes integrated here, which all looked very real. Maybe besides the fact that there was just a little blood when Luke gave the creature that stroke with the saber. That might be another criticism of this film. I mean there is quite a bit of lightsaber action in which someone is hit (three scenes) and it just appears that there is almost no blood lost. This might be regarded as a bit unreal by some people, but I was satisfied with that, for I am used of it since I was just a little kid and I think it was much better than the stuff that happened for instance in Indiana Jones (which I saw when I was about 11 or so) . For those scenes at the end of the first Indiana Jones really gave me the creeps when I watched that film for the first time and I had quite a couple of nightmares afterward. Whereas nothing of that kind happened after I had seen any of the thee old' episodes of the Star Wars Saga about a year earlier.
What I especially like about this film is, of course the battle on Hoth, right at the beginning, which starts this episode of the epic tale. In this film there are much more elaborate and much better battle scenes. But not only on Hoth, but also on the city in the clouds. I'm not talking about those laser fights here, but I'm talking about the lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, which is so much better than the saber duel in Episode IV between Obi Wan and Vader. Last but not at all least there is much more character development in this one than in Episode IV and that also is what makes this such a great film. Besides all that, this film also introduces us to Yoda, (well if you've not seen Episode I that is) and the Emperor, who is the driving force behind the oh  so evil Vader. Speaking of which, he is really evil in this film. I mean if you thought you have seen his full wickedness in the first part you are so wrong. This man really is unpredictable and bad to the bone. His heart has been, you might say, destroyed by the dark side of the force, which is composed mainly of fear and hate.
Yoda is though important not that much of a main character, than you'd expect. He is just the person who is responsible for the upbringing' of the Jedi knights and who has been responsible for that for about 800 years. Although he seems quite useless and strange at the beginning, he actually is quite smart and helpful for Luke in this Episode in which Luke sees his connection with the Force reach a higher level. While Luke and Yoda prepare for battle Han and Leia are just making time fly by with a lot of jokes and action. I really must say here that Harrison Ford is great as Han Solo, who in this Episode (again) delivers most of the jokes. He is quite the scoundrel (as Princess Leia rightly noticed) and he is by far my most favorite character in the whole series, for his one  liners and his conversations with Princess Leia will always be remembered by me. My other favorite comedian from the first film (C  3PO) is not on such a roll as in the first one, but he still is pretty funny. The fact that Han Solo is my favorite character does not mean I do not like Luke, or I do not sympathize with him. It is just that if I wanted to be a character in Star Wars I would want to be Han Solo, because I think he is coolest and because I think if I could be someone in this Saga I could be Han Solo.
Besides all that, there happens something in this Star Wars film, that is well known and remembered by all fans of the Saga and it is something I do not want to spoil for anyone of you who has not seen this film (if there are such persons). All of the fans will know what I'm talking about and I think that is the biggest and most important event of the whole saga and by far the most touching one too. It brought tears to my eyes when I saw it again, something I would not have expected. It was just done so well, I really must applaud everyone who took part in that scene and of course George Lucas and John Williams, who in my eyes is the god of Scores.
Watch, be blown away, surprised and moved.
May the force be with youalways.
9 out of 10"
23161,False,"GEORGE LUCAS has inspired all of us STAR WARS lovers with STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE in 1977, in 1980 he then brought us STAR WARS: EPISODE V - THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (second in the STAR WARS TRILOGY) is a much darker film, with more drama, romance and evil. Being a more dramatic film is actually quite heart warming at times, JOHN WILLIAM's fantastic musical score and the actors of the film have helped a lot to make the dramatic scenes...dramatic.We see a lot more of LUKE SKYWALKER's (well acted by MARK HAMILL) development as a JEDI KNIGHT and education of the FORCE. A new character is introduced in this film and his name is...YODA who is a GREAT JEDI MASTER, one of the most interesting characters in the holy trilogy. YODA grabs the eye of the audience with his short and funny appearance and astonishing JEDI powers. The elements of the FORCE in this film are much more interesting and inspiring than what we see in the other two STAR WARS movies, with uplifting scenes like LUKE's education of the FORCE from YODA.One of the many highlights of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is the blossoming romance between HAN SOLO (amaZingly performed by HARRISON FORD) and PRINCESS LEIA (played sweetly by CARRIE FISHER). LEIA's sweet, innocent yet tough personality miXes well with HAN's scoundrellish style.THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK being the DARKER film of the trilogy, has more evil within, which means there is more of the dark lord of the sith...DARTH VADER (played by DAVID PROWSE and the voice of JAMES EARL JONES). VADER uses his powers much more effectively here, he dominates the movie and shows no mercy.Another good mention is the SPECIAL EFFECTS, they are actually a little more dazzling than the EFFECTS in the first film, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK won a special OSCAR for the VISUAL EFFECTS.If you haven't seen THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK I suggest you have a look at it and see what you think, I think anyone who's anyone should enjoy it, but if you haven't seen STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE, I strongly suggest you see that before STAR WARS: EPISODE V - THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is easily the best in the HOLY TRILOGY and one of the best movies ever made, well that's what I think anyway...I rate it a 10/10! Bye kids..."
23162,False,"THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK totally surprised me after the disappointment that was STAR WARS. I rented the film as a curiosity item, but found it very boring and uninteresting. So I wasn't so keen on renting the next episode, but since so many people said it was so much better than the first, I tried it. And I was blown away by it. It was so good, I even bought it. Now I've seen it dozens of times. I never expected it to be so good! I was totally amazed by the effects (great for their time!), the action & adventure and the exciting story. This one moves much faster than STAR WARS. Irvin Kershner is a much better storyteller than George Lucas. I still wonder why he chose not to direct this one and leave it in the hands of someone else. It's the same thing Steven Spielberg directing all of the Indiana Jones films. But I'm happy Lucas made that choice. This movie probably wouldn't have turned as good as it did. It's hard to describe what's so good about this movie and the way it makes you feel as you're watching it. The most important feeling it gives me is the sense of wonder. The space battles are truly breathtaking, and are better than anything else you see in movies today. I think it's safe to say that they truly don't make them like they used to. Hollywood forgot that the most important thing in an action & adventure film is caring about the people who are in danger and creating interesting characters. I don't think we'll ever see another movie like TESB again.In conclusion, simply GO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW. Even if you've seen it dozens of times, watching this movie for the hundredth time will always be a more pleasant experience than watching those crappy films in video stores today.Beware of the original release. Some stores still have those."
23163,False,"This one will always be my personal favourite of the original Star Wars Trilogy, mostly because it is the best. Everything really came together here; so much so, that even George Lucas didn't change that much for the Special Edition, and what he did change only served to enhance the greatness that was already there. Probably the most notable difference between this one and the original Star Wars was in the writing, by the late Leigh Brackett and the then-neophyte Lawrence Kasdan. Brackett had a great way with a putdown, but not to the point of simply being snarky. Lines like ""I'd just as soon kiss a Wookie!"""" I can easily arrange that; you could use a good kiss!"" serve as punctuation, and not the entire point of the film. This is why irony is dying its currently slow and painful death: a lack of skill and judgement in the use of insults, sarcasm, and other putdowns. This film has the great banter of an old Bogart-Bacall film, which also gave it an edge back in 1980, when so few intelligent films were being released. When the best banter of the year is coming from a space opera, that's pretty dire, but I digress. To critics of my point of view, yes this film is a downer, but that's what makes it so great. As the middle act, it shouldn't have a happy ending, and that's what will be so cool about Episodes II and III. We know the new trilogy is going to end on a down note, but like Titanic, we can't help but watch. If the plot mechanics operate in any way like they did in Empire, it's going to be a good time at the movies."
23164,False,"I have seen this movie many times, and each time I see it it gets better and better.  It has everything,romance, action, suspense and catches you in the end with a twist ending.  To really appreciate this film one has to look past the fact that it is a cult classic.  Watch it as a movie not as ""one of those geeky science-fiction films""."
23165,False,"I love the empire strikes back. Because of four words, ""I Am your Father"". Not only unexpected, but totally surprising and apalling. It just draws you into this film, you forget you are watching a movie. There's really no word to describe such an experience. It is so amazing that movies become such perfect masterpieces sometimes. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is jammed full of character growth, drama, evil. The best part is... this is a cliffhanger movie. What will they do? How will they escape? Will they survive? Perhaps it's a great film that can leave you wanting more. But while leaving you wanting answers, you will want to watch the movie over and over to re-experience the pure darkness and discoveries. So many backdrops in this film personify this movie. The Matte paintings and/or sets of Dagobah seem very dark and almost ominous. Just a hint of the sublime add a lot to what was not there before. if anything, the movie is unparalelled in it's mastery of what the cinema was originally intended to show. At least, it is still a damn sight better than phantom menace."
23166,False,"Say what you like about A New Hope, Return of the Jedi, or The Phantom Menace.  For sheer emotional power, this one has got them all blown out of the water.The first time I saw any of the Star Wars movies was when I was laid up at home after having my wisdom teeth removed the summer before my senior year in high school.  The movies just blew me away, but not having time to get overly attached to any of them, I decided that the Empire Strikes Back was the best, for many reasons.  We get more plot in this movie than in any of the other three.  There isn't necessarily as much action as the more exciting Return of the Jedi, nor is it all as new and visually exciting as A New Hope, but the story is more important here than all that extra stuff.When the original Star Wars came out, people were so blown away by the special effects that no one really noticed what a bad movie it was.  Not that it was a terrible movie, but the dialogue was terrible, the acting was atrocious, and the direction was, well, choppy.  It was a great movie, but very badly made.  Does this ring a bell?  Sounds almost exactly like what we have been hearing about the Phantom Menace, doesn't it?Return of the Jedi was a much better movie than A New Hope.  All the actors had gotten a little better.  It was a very different cast than in the original.  The action was more intense, the story was wrapping up, and we got one final titanic battle with the Empire.  Special effects technology had gotten better as well.  The biggest problem with the movie was how long-winded it was.  How many ways can the emperor phrase the same statement?  You'll have to watch it to find out.Which brings me to The Empire Strikes Back.  The action wasn't as intense, the acting wasn't a whole lot better, and loyal Star Wars fans got ticked off at how cute Yoda was.  There's really no pleasing some people, you know? They reacted the exact same way with the Ewoks and Jar Jar Binks.  Amazing. Anyway, with all these problems, why go see the movie?  The answer: here is where the plot thickens.  Just when it seemed that the Rebellion had gotten the Empire on the run, the Empire comes back and just about crushes their best hopes.  We get the shocking truth about Darth Vader's identity (well, it was shocking when the movie came out...I don't think anyone who has even heard of Star Wars doesn't know it by now).  We get crucial hints to the relationship between Luke and Leia.  You get murder, betrayal, and a truly terrifying encounter in the swamps of Dagobah (hint: not Yoda).  There is so much more to this movie than to any of the others.  That's the reason I consider it to be the best so far.  I'm ready for Episode II."
23167,False,"Without a doubt the best of the Star Wars trilogy.  It almost goes without saying.  Even if you like another of the Star Wars film better for whatever reason, you cannot say that artistically and technically that those movies are better.  That would be on the level of saying that the Goodfellas (which is one of the Master's best films)was better than the Godfather(I or II).
Everything from the cohesive sharpness of the dialogue (""I know"" has to be up there with ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn"")to the visual mastery was used to pure perfection. Surprisingly, the visual effects did not really stick out, blending into the story seamlessly. Granted the last scene of ROTJ is quite an adrenaline fest, the effects were all ROTJ really had.
I put this movie on the pedestal belonging to the cavalcade of the great poetic movies: Ikiru, 400 Blows, Pather Panchali, etc. and the great epics: Citizen Kane, Lawrence of Arabia, 2001 and so on.Even if you don't like Star Wars in general or have never watched it; this is not one to pass over lightly."
23168,False,"This is my favorite Star Wars episode.  This is like the most important episode in the trilogy because this is when Luke Skywalker begins to train in becoming a jedi.  Also because it first introduces Yoda and he tells you about the force.  What it is, and how to use it.  Without this episode, a lot of people will be lost.  They would be like, ""What's going to happen if Luke get's mad?""  Obi-Wan tells him to never use/get hatred because that leads to the dark side.  Also, this movie tells us a lot about Han Solo and Princess Leia, where they actually express their love towards each other.  Other than that, it tells you about Han's deal with Jaba, how he has to pay him or else.....  In Star Wars: A New Hope, it tells you this, but not as much in this movie.  So my review of this movie is that I think its the best Star Wars episode.  I give it 4.5/5."
23169,False,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" belongs to that rare breed of sequels being better than their hailed forerunners. There is more suspense than in ""Star Wars"" (1977), there are deeper developed characters than in ""Star Wars"" and it is better written (Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett no less!) than ""Star Wars"". After all, and especially after that computer animated waste of anyone´s time called, among other things, ""The Phantom Menace"" (1999), the suspicion that George Lucas might have invented the Star-Wars-Universe but isn´t its major artistic force is rooted in evidence."
23170,False,"I am what you call a ""star wars nerd"". i love the movies, i have their merchandise, and, i can't wait for the flicks to come out on dvd, so i can make george lucas richer than ever. but my favorite one of all is ""the empire strikes back"". Boba fett could nuke anything cross-eyed, and in this movie, he plays a big role, so, naturally, i love it. the story was great, it was longer than ""a new hope"", and a smidgen better than ""return of the jedi"". Indeed this is the greatest of them all."
23171,False,"I remember as a 10 year old child seeing this movie when it was first released back in 1980.  I was completely awestruck by the special effects, characters, and the incredible plot-twist at the ending. Now, 20 years later, nothing has changed.  ""The Empire Strikes Back"" still leaves me with a feeling that no movie before or after ever has.  A feeling that I have just seen the absolute pinnacle of cinematic masterpieces.  I have never seen the ""Special Edition"".  I never intend to.  I want to rememberr TESB as it was originally released.  Because, in my opinion, there is no improvement on perfection.The soundtrack of this movie is absolutely the best original soundtrack that I have ever heard. Just a couple of days ago, I purchased it for the 3rd time. I had it on 8 track, vinyl, and now own it on compact disc.  Now I can experience the movie all over again just by listening to the complete score. TESB is the best movie ever made....PERIOD....Slightly better than the original...Much better than ""Return of the Jedi...and MILES above the ""Phantom Menace""...my God, what was Lucas thinking? Let's just hope that Episode II will do TESB justice, and bring a sense of respect back to the Star Wars saga. But one thing is for certain, TESB will forever be the greatest movie ever made....PERIOD!!!"
23172,False,"As far as movies go, The Empire Strikes Back is the best Star Wars film. It's arguably the most important one, as it builds up the story arc with all its little plot twists, including a surprise ending that ranks right up with Usual Suspects and Sixth Sense. Of course, everyone in the world knows about Luke and Vader now, so I can only hope people can keep Keyser Soze's secret a bit more secret. Anyway, it's really kind of a letdown that Star Wars was nominated for Best Picture but ESB wasn't (just try and name the 1980 winner, go on). This is the finest sequel ever made, much better than Godfather II, and it deserves not only a few Oscars but a lot more money too...it's been knocked out of the Top Ten, a fate that no Star Wars film deserves, especially the best one."
23173,False,"Hello Friends,The Empire Strikes back is the best of the series because it is the ""reality check"".  The bad guys get the upper hand and the Empire take control with flash and fury which ultimately sets the stage for a big showdown.  I am rather hoping that the second installment will be similar and let us see the dark side more vividly. Just how evil did these folks have to become in order to kill almost all of the Jedi? I always thought that Darth Vader was infinitely more interesting than any member of the Rebel Alliance. This movie is a complete downer but wonderfully constructed and written.  It is easy to see why folks anticipated the release of the sixth (3rd) installment.  The ESB started a war that seemed hard for the Rebels to beat...but then again, what do I know??  Enjoy  :)"
23174,False,"EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is the best of the STAR WARS saga hands down. And if PHANTOM MENACE is any indication, it will remain the best once George Lucas completes the other two prequels.Lucas needs to step back and take a look at the elements that made EMPIRE STRIKES BACK not only a great sequel but a classic film on its own.
He should hand over the story of the following prequels to another screenwriter as he did with EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and the directing chores to someone who has a pulse on today's audience.That's the only way the prequels can live up to EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, the second best sequel of all time behind ALIENS, and before GODFATHER II and ROAD WARRIOR."
23175,False,"""Empire Strikes Back"" is a wonderful example of how much better a movie can be when it's not directed by George Lucas.  Lucas, as witnessed by most of his movies, including the latest ""Phantom Menace,"" is a genius at creating astonishing imageries and forming a spectacular visual setting for the storyline to work through.  However, as far as storytelling goes, Irwin Kershner does so much better.There are two reasons why this should be considered the best of all three; oh no wait, four, if you count ""The Phantom Mess,"" which I'm still bitter about for the fact that it will forever remain as a part of the Star Wars saga -- one drop of ink will make the entire vat of water black, and that's what happened.  Anyway, the first reason: The storytelling is amazing.  It was appropriately paced and appropriately lengthy.  It does much better development of later plot lines than any of the other movies.  The romance between Solo and Leia, for example, is done ever so gently and craftily. Luke is finally acting like a decent actor, as his character goes through major transformation from a reckless, brash jedi wannabe to a man whose identity was completely turned upside down.  And what about Darth Vader, the greatest villain in cinematic history?  You see him here more as a guile, manipulative, tactical, and extremely intelligent character than Episode IV, where he was much more machinelike and brute.And to me, the ending of this movie had so much more drama than the other two; oh, I mean three, I guess (grr...).  One of the most captivating, significant, and shocking lines in movie history, ""Luke, I am your father!"" still sends shivers and jolt through my body.  This is where everything is revealed, and all of the questions presented implicitly in the first Star Wars are answered.Second, this was simply the most difficult one to make, and you have to give due credit to writers, directors, and produces for that (yes, that includes Lucas).  This transition is done ever so perfectly, and that is why I consider this movie a notch better than all others.  Well, that is, if you don't by the fact that it is flat-out the best movie anyway.If you have not seen any Star Wars movies yet.  Start watching from Episode IV, NOT I!  It will make more sense to do so.  Oh, by the way, here's how I rank the Star Wars movies.Star Wars: ***1/2; Empire Strikes Back: ****; Return of the Jedi: ***; (and yeah yeah, The Phantom Menace: **)I'm just praying Episode II is better than the previous!"
23176,False,"This one might of fallin short with the space battles, but it more than made up for that with the Lightsaber Battles and the plot twists(you now what I'm talking about) and the cliffhanger at the end was a great Idea. the best one."
23177,False,"Out of the four Star Wars films (Only Episodes 1,4,5,and 6 existed when this was written) I feel that this is the most philosophical of the group.  The scenes with Yoda and Luke remind me of those old kung fu movies with the wise, old master teaching the Art (or in this case the Ways of the Force) to his young and inexperienced disciple.   Those scenes and the battle between Luke and Darth Vader are pure classics.Despite this, I did not place this part at the top of my list of ""Best Star Wars Movie.""  After seeing Episode 4, where the underdog Rebels rise up against incredible odds to defeat the all powerful Empire in a beautifully done space battle, Episode 5 seemed to be sharp turn towards the opposite direction.  Han gets captured, frozen in carbonite, and transported to Jabba; the Empire beats the crap out of the Rebels time and time again; Luke gets his hand hacked off; and Darth Vader reveals that he is Luke's father. Totally different than the episode before it.Those who have seen the first one (Episode IV for those who don't know) and haven't seen the second one (Episode V) then I have just this to say...SHAME ON YOU!  But seriously, be wary.  It is not called, The Empire Strikes Back for nothing."
23178,False,"The Empire Strikes Back is that rarest of films, a sequel that is superior to it's predecessor.  Thrilling, eiree, magical, funny and involving.  Fans of fantasy/adventure simply cannot ask for more than this. Director Irvin Kershner creates a modern day mythology that lingers in the viewers mind long after the credits roll and the lights come up. The upcoming LORD OF THE RINGS films are building up alot of anticipation, but I doubt if any film in that much awaited trilogy can live up to the towering acheivment of Empire.  This film is quite simply the best of it's kind."
23179,False,"Star Wars movies don't come any better than this. This movie is the best Star Wars movie, and it combines rough action, and relationships. The characters are more developed in this movie, especially Luke Skywalker. C-3PO is slightly annoying in this movie, but he gets along well. Yoda is a wonderful addition to the crew, and he's even better in the Phantom Menace. But the most interesting character to watch is Darth Vader. Why? Because he's purely evil, and he's so hell bent on getting Skywalker. The scene where he reveals himself is probably cinema's most dramatic scene.A well done movie, followed by a good sequel.4/4."
23180,False,"Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope was a tough act to follow. However, Lucas did it with Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. Without a doubt, it is the darkest of the Star Wars films (until Episode III comes out anyway) giving it a real dramatic feel to it. It also reveals the true fate of Anakin Skywalker. One that had audiences around the world gasping in surprise. Also contains one of the greatest sword fights in movie history."
23181,False,"The story is very dark, far darker than the first.  This film introduces many new exotic locations as well as a few new characters such as the Jedi Master, Yoda.  The film has one of the finest climaxes of any film I've seen.  The movie shows the true power of the dark side and the evil of Darth Vader.  The music is just as good as it was in the first, here we are introduced to the notorious Imperial March.  More is done with stop motion animation but other then that the special effects are just as good as the were in the previous film.  Do yourself a favor and watch this classic."
23182,False,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a stronger film than ""Star Wars"". The characters are stronger and more established and it is better made. This film is arguably the best sequel of all time, it expands on the original rather than remaking it. This is the best film out of all the ""Star Wars"" films though I really liked ""Episode 1"". A must see film."
23183,False,"Every time I watch this movie in whatever format (big screen, video, letterbox or pan and scan) I am absolutely entranced by the feel of it. The opening snow battle (with those insanely elephantine Imperial Walkers) and the chase scene amidst the asteroids are as thrilling as any scenes in the ""quadrilogy"". But what especially draws me in is the heaviness that seems to imbue just about every frame and every line the actors speak. This is quite a (welcome) jolt from the whiz bang frivolity that wins over Episodes 1, 4 & 6. I don't know how much of this tonal change (if you will) was brought to the material by director Irvin Kershner or how much it had to do with the necessary downturn in the script that was pre-ordained to end in the Darth Vader's favor. Whatever or whoever was responsible added psychological muscle to an already hyperactive story. I also loved the deepening relationship between Princess Leia and Han Solo. Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford generate some real electricity, albeit confused and awkward (until the end, of course), in the middle of all the other excitement. In fact I think that one of the most romantic scenes in movie history comes when the Princess declares her love for Han just before he gets carbonized and he replies that he knows her feelings. What could have come off as terribly smart alecky and arrogant instead resonates with reciprocation and desparation the way Ford says his line. This romance is what really carries this movie for me. Finally John William's score is among his all-time best and with or without the movie absolutely soars."
23184,False,"As if being a part of the most successful series ever, Empire stands as the best movie ever.  Though it could not exist without its counterparts, its plot complexities, character development and superlative story telling allow it to reign superior.  Even though it was the least successful of the the trilogy, most critics agree it is the best of the series.  It accepts its role as a single part of a series and takes the most signficant strides to give the Star Wars saga meaning.And who can forget 'No, I am your father.'"
23185,False,"The sequel to George Lucas' fantastical Science Fiction story ""A New Hope"" has a dark and excellent follow up in ""The Empire Strikes Back""- my favourite film of all time. Who could ever imagine that Darth Vader lord of all evil, was once Annakin Skywalker soft-spoken, noble Jedi Knight and most of all Luke's father. We have the debut of Master Yoda, ostensibly a comical character but in truth a deep and thoughtful Lord of the Force If you Haven't seen Empire with it's dark battle between Vader and Luke at the Climax, and the opening for the sequel at the end then my feeble minded friends you simply haven't lived."
23186,False,"This movie is the best of the three. Better lightsaber sequences, and better effects. The realtionship  between Luke and Yoda, especially when Yoda tells Luke not to leave, but he leaves anyway, was great. Han and Leia get a little bit of action, and C-3P0 gets pushed around. The ending was a complete shock for me. I never thought a sequel can be better than the original, I was wrong. A great film, I suggest for everyone to see it. 11/10."
23187,False,"It took the release of the worst, most disappointing film of all time (The Phantom Menace) for me to realize that ESB is my favorite movie of all time. Aside from the great story, characters, acting, dialogue, art direction, etc. etc. etc. -- it is simply the most primal, mythic, formative movie of my childhood. No movie has ever captured good vs. evil so well. Let's hope Lucas can make Episodes 2 and 3 somewhat closer to ESB and further from the awful crap of Phantom Menace."
23188,False,"The Empire Strikes Back is in my opinion a superior movie to the original Star Wars.  Many true Star Wars fans would agree with me on this.  The characters, action, and overall plot of Empire is greater than its predecessor.  The ending is less predictable and is at the same time relevant to its title.  True, it's not as original as Star Wars because the basic aspects are similar and for that reason may not be regarded the ""greater"" movie, but I think that Empire at least attempts and in my opinion succeeds in breaking the old rule that sequels are never as good as the originals.  It is because of these reasons that The Empire Strikes Back is my favorite movie of all time."
23189,False,"""The Empire strikes back"" is the best movie made in this Century. It´s really more than a movie, it´s more a great epic tale brought on the silver screen. Much darker than ""A New Hope"" and more grown up like this first milestone, ""Empire"" creates an atmospheric intensity I felt in no other movie so far, and believe me I saw a lot!  The storyline is far more elaborate than those few critics say, and anyone who gives this film less than at least 6 points definitely doesn´t know anything about the magic in movie-making. ""Empire"" is not only the peak of the Star Wars-Trilogy (so far!), but it´s SFX still stand up to our CGI-overfed Era! Just remember the asteroid field or the battle in the snow on Hoth. And everything is underlined by the best score John Williams ever composed. 10 Points, but only because there are no higher ratings possible."
23190,False,"I saw this movie as a kid, and I have loved it ever since. This movie has excellent special effects (even for today), a great story, great characters, great music. I think the acting was the best of the trilogy. The lightsaber duel was breathtaking and the best of the trilogy, while Vader reveals to Luke the ultimate truth. The Empire Strikes Back will be watched and acclaimed generations down the road. One of the best films in movie history. perfect 10/10"
23191,False,"Although The Empire Strikes Back is the darkest of the trilogy, it encompasses a lot more emotion.  It combines passion, fear, immaturity, betrayal, hatred, growth and love.  The score, I believe is the best ever written, ever piece of music tells a story and the music alone can make my cry or give me chills.  In the Empire Strikes Back Luke has a coming of age, Leia accepts her Love of Han, and even Yoda and Ben learn from Luke.  My favorite character in the Empire Strikes Back is Han Solo.  My favorite line is ""Laugh it up Fuzzball."" and my favorite part is the final scene between Vader and Luke.  When Luke lets go of the structure and falls into the abyss I get tears of joy everytime.  Watch it, you learn about love, friendship, growing and you just might learn something about yourself."
23192,False,"I liked this film a lot over other movie sequels, and among the Star Wars films this one is the second best to The Phantom Menace. With a huge success like A New Hope, making a sequel worthy to it was very tough...unless the makers put their mind to it...and they did. George Lucas did not direct this and he found a great direct with Irvin K. who made this film more human in nature than the first film. In fact, character expression here is the best and so is the character development...both the best in the series. You get to see just how natural the relationship of Leia and Han develop, you get to see more emotion, feel pain (like when Han got tortured or when Luke learned who Darth Vader is), and so much more. This film is definitely worth striking back for! Go for it!"
23193,False,"STAR WARS, obviously the most inspired, barrier-breaking science fiction/adventure movie ever made (thus far), showed us that you could fit your three acts in three separate movies. I think the first one was spectacular, an invitation to a fantasy world unlike any you have witnessed before or since. A very good first act, a very good introduction.But EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, in my opinion, is the best in the trilogy. Why? Let me break it down:1) Yoda. What more can I say? An ancient alien midget. A wisecracking Jedi Master. Where Han Solo gives us the irony of the series, Yoda gives us the muppet-ized hilarity of it. 2) Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. The only brotha in the future it looks like, but the dude is bad. He also gets more acting skills and character conflict here than he does in RETURN OF THE JEDI.3) Han Solo and Princess Leia. It's so funny when you look at STAR WARS: A NEW HOPE, and you think that she loves Luke. Han and Leia are so cute here. Bickering, fighting, kissing, and in the end, admitting of their true feelings. And Han always knew. What a lovely intergalactic romance.4) We first learn of Darth Vader's true identity and his relation to Skywalker.5) Awesome light sabre showdown between Vader and Luke that served up what we couldn't get from Vader and Obi-Wan's confrontation in HOPE. Unfortunately, it was rehashed into an overlong, boring one in JEDI, inserted between an even more boring starship battle.6) Oh, and speaking of starship battles. There are none! I think these are the main flaw of all the film containing them. They are cool to witness for the first few minutes, but they go on and on without doing anything different or interesting within the long time.7) Luke loses his hand. Throughout EMPIRE, you feel this dark dread, but this is the icing on the cake. A lost battle of Luke's. But the war is not over.8) The set pieces are out of this world. The icy snow in the beginning. The misty, marshy swamp of Yoda's home. The heavenly blissful City in the Clouds. Even the Death Star looks better than the last one! Not to mention Darth's suit looks MUCH better, as do R2D2 and C3P0, most likely to do with the gross earned from the first one.9) There are so many cool creatures and machines here. Like the elephant-like tanks in the beginning or the llama-like creatures used for horses around the snowy desert.There is a flaw however. A very annoying one, in fact. Chewbacca moans too much! You get so tired as he goes on and on about the desperate situation. I guess it was meant to go with the ongoing dread and unease you feel throughout the film. After all, this is the ACT II, the conflict of the trilogy. Still, I believe Episode V to be the best of this trilogy. Now to see which will be the best of the first three episodes...."
23194,False,"I used to think that Return Of The Jedi was the best out of the original 3, and The Empire Strikes Back was the worst, but that was when I was a kid. Since then, I have grown up a bit more now and watched the 3 all over again. I now believe that Empire is clearly the best of the 3. Why is that? Because of the following things. 1. Best Plot out of the three and it shows you that it doesn't all come down to special effects. 2. The movie is very dark, revealing and more importantly it's realistic that the bad guys actually win.Like how many movies out there do u see the bad guys win? The trouble with other movies is they are so predictable in that you know what will happen. In Empire you don't. 3. Best acting by the cast out of the three. 4. The soundtrack, the best music score I have ever heard. It adds a lot to the movie. 5. Irvin Kershner did a fantastic job of directing, I wish George Lucas brought him back for episodes 2 and 3. The scenes with Luke in the cave was Brilliant. The Battle Of Hoth was great, but I really enjoyed the scenes on Dagobah with Yoda and Luke. Yoda telling us about the force and the brilliant ending. This movies is 5/5 stars and my favourite movie off all time In conclusion I wish George Lucas would watch TESB again and realise the prequels should be done the way empire was done. The Phantom Menace was above average but it is nowhere near as good as Empire and the WORST out of the 4."
23195,False,"This movie takes all the great elements of Star Wars and elevates them to something deeper and more emotionally resonant.  Sure, there are cool aliens, action sequences, and all, but here the heroes have to deal with things us normal people also deal with.  Along with helmeted villains, snow monsters and the like, they face sexual tension, identity crisis, spiritual yearning, betrayal, parental issues, separation from loved ones, etc...  The pacing is just perfect, although there seems to be a screwed-up sense of time.  (Luke seems to be with Yoda for at least weeks, but the pursuit of the Falcon seems to take only a few days.)  The film is full of dreamy visuals--- a city in the clouds, a murky swamp planet, Kenobi's ghostly appearances, Luke's confrontation in the cave on Dagobah.  And the best part is the uncertain ending.  The bad guys seem to have won, and the heroes' fates are up in the air.  Definitely the best of the series.  Watch it again and again, it's worth it!"
23196,False,"The Empire Strikes Back is the best movie I have seen of all my life ! It has an amazing story, great actors and jaw dropping special effect. Irvin Kirshner did an outstanding direction !! The scenery is an eye candy. This movie has one of the most reminded ending ever : ""Luke, I am your father"". It is full of fantasy and imagination. Who said that sequels sucks ???I give it ***** + * /*****"
23197,False,"I know what you're thinking. ""There are millions of movies out there, what makes this your all time favorite?"" Well the truth is this. I've seen hundreds of movies in my life. When it comes to me and film, there's no genre I don't like and a movie has to have a lot of annoying qualities for me to dislike it. So I'm quite easy to please when it comes to the cinema. I know I haven't answered your question yet but bear with me.There was a time before I saw Star Wars and at that point I never really saw a movie that I didn't like. But once I first witnessed the adventures in that galaxy far, far away, my imagination (for the very first time) was actually pulled from reality and into this ""space opera"". I've never really been one for fantasy. In fact to this day, I can't quite understand the hoopla surrounding Harry Potter or the Lord of the Rings. But for some reason I can't really explain, these movies did it for me.You see, the (original) Star Wars trilogy for me is what really made me look at movies as more than just something to keep you entertained on a rainy day. At this point on, it was the basis of comparison to all the films I've seen in my life. I have yet to see a movie that I like better and I doubt I ever will because when it comes to MY taste in movies, this trilogy is as perfect as it gets.Now that I've totally gotten over my little Star Wars love fest there, let me go on to explain why The Empire Strikes Back is my favorite.I didn't see Star Wars until I was 15 so I wasn't one of those kids who grew up with it. Although if I knew then what I knew now, I'm sure it would be different. Anyway, I started seeing all this commotion about it's Special Edition re-release in 1997. It was obvious that there was something special about these movies that stood the test of time. So I went into the basement and found my dad's old Beta copies of the trilogy and decided to check them out. (I'm glad I kept my old Beta VCR, heheh) I popped in the original film and suddenly a whole new world of film was opened up to me. (But that's a whole other story.) I was so captivated by the magic of the original film, that I was kind of afraid to watch the sequels as I was afraid they would be inferior. How do you live up to that kind of masterpiece? I've never second guessed a movie since that day.So the time came to watch The Empire Strikes Back. I wanted to see the continuing adventures of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia and see if they could really bring down the evil Darth Vader. They blew up the Death Star already I thought they won! Until this point, I thought Star Wars was just this happy tale of good triumphing over evil. Well...I was blown away to see Luke attacked by the Wampa Ice Creature when the movie started, the AT-AT Walkers demolishing the rebel base on Hoth, Han Solo frozen in carbonite before the eyes of those who loved him and Darth Vader revealing Luke Skywalker's true parentage. (Of course, I already knew that, but everyone knew even if they didn't see the movies.) At the end, the bad guys won. You don't really see that in a lot of movies, because it wouldn't work. Unless you're creating a trilogy, that just doesn't sit well with audiences. If I saw RoboCop and at the end he was blown to pieces, I would be disappointed. But here it works, because you knew there was another movie coming and there was time to make everything all right.This movie has everything a film buff could love. It has action, humor, romance and characters that I haven't been so in love with until I saw Trainspotting. However, that's a completely different type of film.By the time it was all over, I realized that this film had more of an impact on me emotionally than the original film did. At the end of the first film I found myself cheering for the characters. At the end of this one I found myself worrying about them and hoping that it would all be all right.The Star Wars saga is, and will always be my favorite saga of all time. Because even if I'm having a bad day at work or one of my friends gets mad at me for saying something stupid or a girl decides she's finally had enough of me, the Star Wars saga will always be there to bring back my sanity. Heheh.And that's why this is my favorite movie of all time. 10/10"
23198,False,"Sequel to Star Wars starts out hot, becomes talky and loses steam in plot entanglements.  Was it really necessary for Darth Vader to be Luke's father to make this work?  Does that make Alec Guinness a liar (heaven forbid) in Star Wars, when he describes Luke's father?  Is there any reason to make a movie of this ""magnitude"" and expect your viewers to wait two years to find out what happens?  At that point, do we care what happens?  No, yes, no, and not as much as we did before."
23199,False,"Well I watched the whole trilogy over the weekend just to get a better feel for things.  I must say that this was the best of the three.  Lucas touched on every subject and more within the Star Wars universe.  This story actually leads directly into The Return of the Jedi.  Unlike Star Wars which basically could have stood alone and gotten its point across.  The movie needs Jedi as a follow up or it just doesn't work.  But that doesn't diminish from the quality of the movie.  And I must also say that even though I was watching the Special Edition.  The ORIGINAL effects were superb.   So to sum up, if you want to see the best out of the four Star Wars movies, please watch this one.  It's definately(sp?) worth it."
23200,False,"Let me say that it is my second favorite in the saga. This episode is fast paced , a decent plot and cool special effects!!My favorite one is Return of the Jedi !!it is favorite for special effects though!!This movie also features an awesome score by composer John Williams!The score is classic even if you do not like all of his scores!!Look for future star Billy Dee Williams in this movie as well!!"
23201,False,"One of my earliest memories was seeing Empire (the original release) on the big screen when I was five years old.  I remember feeling all the peaks and vallies of the perils of the heroes, as vividly as I do when I watch it now. That is the definition of a timeless classic."
23202,False,"Because I grew up with Star Wars, I have always found it difficult to choose a favorite episode in the Star Wars Trilogy.  I love them all equally. However, I do like The Empire Strikes Back very much for many of the same reasons that Samuel (see previous comment) did.  It seems that the characters really find themselves in this film.  They come to grips with who they are and what they're doing in life.  Some of the awkwardness of A New Hope is shed and they begin to (if I may use a cliché) blossom.  I think it's a perfect middle story, it has a nice cliffhanger, yet it never disappoints you!"
23203,False,"This movie serves so many purposes and accomplishes them all.  TESB does a fantastic job of bridging the gap between an intro and a conclusion to a great saga.  Not only that, but this great sequel builds character involvement and plot.  An all time great and easily the best of the Star Wars movies, one gets a true feel for the story and what the characters are going through.  ROTJ and a New Hope do not give you this same feeling.  A new Hope is simply meant to introduce the characters (Lucas alluded to this), and ROTJ wraps things up.  On a personal note I watch this one the most and never get sick of it.  It is definitely the meat and potatoes of Star Wars."
23204,False,"""Empire"" is the best film of the original trilogy. Rather than remake the first film, Lucas takes the world that he devoped in the first movie and takes things even further. The story in this movie is better. There's much more character devolopment and the characters are fleshed out more. The movie takes a darker tone with the fate of Han Solo and the big revelation regarding Luke and Darth Vader. The bigger budget also helps allowing for improved special effects to complement the improvements from the first movie. Proof that not all sequels have to suck."
23205,False,The Empire Strikes Back is the greatest movie of all time.  It doesn't depend on the first movie for characters and action.  It however sets up the beautiful plot conflicts and scenes that help move the series.  Basically there is no better movie in the series.  No other movie has this many surprises and emotional scenes as this one.  'Nuff Said.
23206,False,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a superb installment in the star wars trilogy. First, lets get started with the snow battle on the Ice planet of Hoth, Excellent!. The Imperial Walkers were inventive and another one of Lucas's great creations. The snow battle is my second favorite battle in the series next to Yavin. This films intensity was great. Vader had such dominate and evil presence, starting with hoth and ending with the best one on one confrontation I have ever seen in a movie, Vader vs Luke up top the most imaginative city of Bespin. Awesome!!!! I love the little green creature of yoda, who teaches Luke in the ways of the force.I love him not becuase he is unique and original but becuase he can act as well.Finally, I thought Boba Fett was an awesome bounty hunter and a great addition to threat of the empire. ""Empire"" focused on the darkness of star wars. It buried down into its mythology and made a strong backbone to the series. When C 3PO, R2, Leia, and Luke starred beyond into the outer rims of space at the films conclusion, never before have I been left with the curiousity and anticipation I felt at that moment. ""Return of the Jedi"" forfilled that anticipation and curiousity quite well may I add. I'll give "" Empire"" *** 1/2 out of **** stars. Classic!!!!"
23207,False,"Who'd have pegged Irvin Kershner as a likely candidate to take over George Lucas's trashily popular STAR WARS franchise? Luckily, the decision was made and Kershner turned in what is, by a long stretch, the best of the series. THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is a breathless chase movie but, unusually for this series, plot is allowed to intrude on action and the actors seem to have suddenly found some character. The whole thing is infused with a wonderfully dark operatic quality, greatly assisted by the rich and imaginative visuals. Movies like this need a good hissable villain and Dave Prowse and James Earl Jones as (respectively) the body and voice of Darth Vader turn him into a truly frightening nemesis (rather than the cardboard cut-out he is in the other films), all of which serves to give the whole enterprise a weighty centre that was completely absent from its predecessor.A grand and sweeping addition to both the STAR WARS canon (and sci-fi cinema generally) before the disappointing plunge into 2-dimensional characters and cuteness that was 1983's RETURN OF THE JEDI and the flashy CGI emptiness which became the trademark of the series by the time the trilogy of prequels ended in 2005."
23208,False,Again what can I say about this film other than it's pure genius. This one tells a lot like Luke meeting up with Yoda and finding out that Vadar is his father. The battle scene between Luke and Vadar is fantastic! Great movie I give this 5 ***** stars all the way!!!
