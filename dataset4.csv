22353,True,"This is without a doubt the movie I have seen the most time in my life, and I am hoping to watch it many times again before I die. I cannot understand how anyone can hate this movie, I don't give a F*** if it stole an Oscar from Pulp Fiction or The Shawshank Redemption. (Both some of my favorite movies) Probably the movie with most undeserved hate, and I can simply not understand why, This movie has everything, and here's why. This movie is both heart-warming and heart-breaking, it is funny, sad, adventurous, and most of all beautiful, to not love this movie you must be the saddest person on earth, just meaning that I do not see how anyone can not look at this movie without tears in their eyes. I mean this movie broke me down the first time I watched it, and it broke me down the 10th time I saw it. It is the most beautiful story about love, friendship, family, but if there is one thing Forrest Gump is about it is life. To see the life of this simple minded man will almost certainly change your's.The way Robert Zemeckis directs this movie is more than perfect, and is a huge part of why the movie is so utterly amazing. Without a doubt Zemecki's best movie yet, counting all the great movies he has made. The soundtrack is also one of the most beautiful I have heard in years, and and just perfectly captures the movie. Tom Hanks almost certainly gives his best performance till date, and Robin Wright just outshines herself in this amazing performance. Also incredible performances from some more unknown actors like, Sally Field, Gary Sinise, and Mykelti Williamson. I don't think I can name another movie that has both made me laugh so much and cry so much. I don't think I can name another movie where I have ever been so sad, ever been so happy, ever been so empathetic to a guy I know is pure fiction. But I think I have praised this movie long enough for you to get my view, so i am gonna finish by saying, if you haven't watched this movie you have no idea what you are missing. 10/10"
22354,True,"What I find completely ridiculous is why this movie, in my opinion one of the best ever, has such a low rating, so I've tried to figure out what some found against it.I noticed that the haters of this movie who make it have a lower rating than it actually deserves mainly argue that it promotes the government's politics of submission: the idea that ""if you're an idiot but you do what you're told then you will be rewarded, but, if you experience life then you're going to die a miserable death."" I'm not an American myself so i don't have any intention to defend the government or anyone else, but I think that the political events witnessed by the character in the movie make many miss the whole substance of the film. I think these bits of history only add to the magic of the film, making Forrest part of a fantastic world that seems so incredibly real though. How can somebody say that Forrest is just an idiot, an ordinary person who does everything that he is told to do? It appears to me that in fact,in his innocence, Forrest does what he feels he has to do,no matter the situations and the people around him, lead only by an inner sense of right. So what actually seems to be special about Forrest is that, regardless of his intelligence, he has the capacity to discover simple truth and life values that all the others around him miss: he tries to save Bubba endangering his own life, he gives Bubba's family money and mainly displays simple goodness in everything he does. So if you haven't yet seen the movie or you were disappointed by it, try watching it without analyzing things that much and just open your heart towards that world. The brilliant humour, the hilarious yet touching acting, the special effects and the uplifting message are totally rewarding."
22355,True,"Starring: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Sally Field This was flat out one of the best movies of 1994. It won best picture for a reason, along with a few other Academy Awards. I think one of the tag lines for the movie was, ""The world will never be the same once you've seen it through the eyes of Forrest Gump."" How true. The movie is basically one simple man's journey through life. And what a journey.The movie opens with Forrest (Hanks) sitting at a bus stop, waiting to go see Jenny (Wright) after being apart from her for years. Who is Jenny, you ask? We'll get to that in a minute. Forrest strikes up a conversation or two with the people that come and wait for the bus with him. Or, more accurately, he keeps talking regardless of whether anybody is listening or not. The movie plays out as a flashback, with Forrest taking us through all the major events of his life and narrating them.The flashback starts when Forrest is a little boy, about six years old or so, just at about the age where he should be starting school. We get to take a look at Forrest's childhood as he gets leg braces to straighten out his back, as his momma (Field) fights (and does a few other things) to get him into public school, and as he meets for the first time the love of his life. Jenny. He meets her on the way to school, sitting next to her on the bus, and they strike up a friendship immediately.Eventually we progress to the point where Forrest and Jenny are in high school, and we travel along with Forrest as he makes it onto the football team and gets to go to college. Forrest and Jenny never date, but he's always there to protect her. Anytime he thinks she's in trouble, he rushes to the rescue, ready to beat the ever-loving snot out of anyone who even looks at his Jenny wrong. I think one of my favorite scenes in the movie is when someone is dumb enough to slap Jenny. The film goes slow motion, Forrest's eyes go wide, and he starts charging at this guy like a runaway locomotive, and has the striking force of one too. Watching him beat the crap out of that guy is hilarious.As Forrest grows up and goes through school, college, the army, a Vietnam tour, becomes a ping pong celebrity, a shrimp boat captain, and eventually one of the richest men out there, he also gets to take a few stops in history as the filmmaker gives us his own spin of how he thinks history would have happened if Forrest Gump were there. He gets to meet the President three times, he's the man who exposes the Watergate scandal, he's at the school doors when Governor George Wallace tries to get some Negroes into a white school, and so on and so forth. It's really funny the way they manipulate historical footage to insert Forrest into the events of the past.This is truly a great movie. You'd be a fool to miss it.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)"
22356,True,"FORREST GUMP (1994) **** Tom Hanks, Sally Field, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson. Brilliantly directed and inspiring comic drama about the truly extraordinary life and times of mentally challenged Forrest Gump (Hanks in the best role of his career won his second Best Actor Oscar in back-to-back winning roles), a simple, honest, and decent man whose childlike innocence is his lucky charm through his altering experiences that span the past two decades flawlessly. Mind-boggling Oscar-winning computerized effects by Industrial Light & Magic has Gump meeting the famous and infamous. Hanks is a wonder (dare you not to get a lump in your throat when it finally registers that he has a child {yes, that's Haley Joel Osment}- watch his face!) and gets fine support especially Wright as the love of his life and Sinise as his best friend (Best Supporting Actor nominee) superior adaptation of Winston Groom's novel by Eric Roth (also an Academy Award recepient) that truly captures lightning in a bottle. Oscars also went to director Robert Zemeckis and for Best Picture. *** One of my all-time favorite flicks. I still cry, particularly Forrest telling Jenny why he loves her so much (""You're my girl!"") and at the gravesite when the birds fly overhead."
22357,True,"i don't usually watch many family type movies, but forrest gump is honestly one of my favourite movies to watch with my son and partner. tom hanks is a wonderful actor and in this movie it shows! there are some tears, some comedy, some laughter, some sadness, just basically a lot of emotions that shows we are all human in one way or another. i never get tired of watching it and seem to learn life lessons every time i watch it because i have forgotten some small phrase or action or something, then think oh wow forgot about that! then it seems familiar like an old friend - it is that sort of movie. very highly recommend it to anyone!"
22358,True,"I saw this movie in the theaters back in 1994. When it was released on VHS I obtained that version. I've watched the movie about once every two years since then. This is an amazing movie in any number of ways. One big way it amazes me, is the way which it, as a simple and guileless little story, like a feather wafting in the breeze, nevertheless evokes raw rank hatred and eyeball-bulging, forehead vein-popping, spittle-spewing vitriol from liberals and so-called ""intellectuals"" who are absolutely certain that, like a guided missile, it is seeking them out, intentionally, personally, to insult them with rightwing thoughts and ideas, and by a nitwit character no less. Hahahaha. As if.So let's first thing pop that little pea right out of the shooter. Let's dispense with the bilge of this movie being some kind of sub rosa rightwing plot. Puh-leeeze. This is a mainstream Hollywood production. Robert Zemeckis, Tom Hanks, Sally Field, and Robin Wright Penn are all known Hollywood lefties, liberal devotees who would take the pipe long before allowing themselves to be associated with or be used by anything akin a rightwing movie, let alone be openly and voluntarily involved in making one. Bottom line, this is not a political movie. This is not a movie which is making any kind of political or social statements in any respect. People who think it is doing any of that are just working way too hard over-thinking it all. Period. It's odd because it's really not all that complicated of a thing to understand. Which leads directly to another amazing thing about this movie: it is amazing the way the simple little message the movie is actually sending just sails right over so many people's heads. Amazingly they just don't get it, and based on the comments here they still aren't getting it 14 years later and counting. So if you fall into that category let me help you out.What is the message of Forrest Gump? Stripped to its purest essence, this movie is about loyalty and devotion, particularly to the ones in our lives we love and care about. These are the human values being reinforced. Loyalty. Devotion. Forrest Gump embodies loyalty and devotion. To his mama. To his good best buddy Bubba. To the love of his life, Jenny. To his leader, Lt. Dan. And in the end to Forrest Jr. One by one and all together Forrest sticks by and takes care of his family, friends, and loved ones. This is the thread running through the entire story. This is what carries Forrest to all of the remarkable places he goes along the way.The use of a mentally challenged man as the leading man is a conceit, used to illustrate the point that loyalty and devotion are the most important things in life, trumping everything else. It drives home the point that nothing else really matters anywhere near as much. Indeed, it drives it home with blunt force. Maybe it drives it home too hard for such a simple little point. Maybe this is where the movie's detractors get themselves side-tracked. There are a number of other amazing and remarkable things about this movie. The performances. The special effects. The almost poetic simplicity of the story and the way it is told. See it for all this and more, but please, don't over-think it."
22359,True,"This might just be the best movie I have ever seen! It made me all kinds of emotional. There are parts that are so funny you will spit out your drink but other parts make it hard to swallow. Forest Gump is a simple man with a simple heart but he sure knows how to tell a story. This is my favorite movie of all time and I wish I could watch it again for the first time. I find that the worst part of the movie is the ending with Jennie. I think the only thing that disturbs me is that Jennie only comes to Forest when she is sick and no one else will take her and then she left... I felt as if Forest deserved more respect than that. However, the rest of the movie is golden. I 100% recommend it anyone in the world."
22360,True,"Since I first saw this film at the age of 8, Forrest Gump has always been my favourite film. As a child this film was magical and Forrest inspired me with his ability to run fast. The scene where he breaks from his leg braces is iconic and highlights how well the movie matches music to emotion. The Forrest Gump theme music by Alan Silvestri hits the mark and truly captures the beauty of a feather moving in the wind. The movie uses the theme of life being like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get. What the audience gets is top tier cinema production on all levels. The director Robert Zemeckis delivers a visually stunning film that shows so much of the American Dream. The acting showcases Tom Hanks, Sally Field and Gary Sinise in their elements and they bring such life and dimension to the characters as we follow Forrest and his Mama across the decades. The movie tackles some of the hard topics with grace and surprising wit, all the while being respectful and quite informative of many historical moments without getting caught up wasting too much time on any one moment. The film to personally becomes one of understanding WHY exactly Forrest was able to be so successful. Luck? Funny script? Are we to believe its like the movie Being There where a man can succeed by the Mr magooing of his ignorance and naiveté. No. Forrest is successful because he is trusting. He puts his faith in others and in return friends help him. Sure a man of lesser intelligence can be swindled and taken advantage of but the story says that a man who works hard, trusts his fellow man and loves his mama and his god will succeed in America. The American Dream."
22361,True,"If this movie were a puppy, it would jump on top of you, wag its tail, lick your face, roll over and present its belly for rubbing, follow you home and hump your leg. It tries so hard to ingratiate itself with what it considers the average American moviegoer of the time, it seems like it was written by a whole committee of campaigning politicians instead of a couple writers. It's the most hollow, contrived piece of baby-boomer mind candy ever projectile vomited onto the national consciousness. It's offensive to mentally retarded people because it patronizingly shows Gump (Tom Hanks) achieving a kind of generation-sweeping fantasy success that no human being, so-called-mentally-challenged or not, could ever hope to achieve, yet still places him in a fairly realistic world (the Viet Nam scenes, for example, were pretty true-to-life in their violence and bloodiness). It's offensive to intelligent viewers because it's storyline and message are as simplistic as the title character. The Dick Cavett Show clip in which John Lennon, sitting next to Gump, simply speaks the lyrics to his song ""Imagine"" was just plain stupid. It's like the writers think the public will think they're exalting them in some kind of new and profound way by making all the popular imagery and beliefs that we've been force-fed throughout our lives into the actual foundation of a person's life. It's like they're saying, ""No, it's not just popular entertainment, it's the stuff that makes up your existence and defines you as a person, and that's all you need, so stop trying to challenge yourself, stop trying to think original thoughts."" George Orwell was right in ""1984"" about the control and manipulation and subjugation of our wills and bodies and intellects, but the source is different. The worst of it isn't coming from the police or the military or the people we work for, but from our entertainment - movies and internet and T.V. - the very things that are supposed to be an escape, at least in our imaginations, from all that drudgery and bullish*t and hassle of the world, and that makes it more insidious and effective. The scene near the end of the movie that takes place in the early 80s in which Jenny (Robin Wright) tells Gump she has some kind of ""new disease"" is an insult to the audience. Are we supposed to feel clever and proud of ourselves for realizing it's AIDS? Would it be considered bad writing if she just said, ""I have this new disease called AIDS""? Also, I heard that the producers spent seven million dollars to digitally erase Gary Sinise's legs instead of hiring a legless actor, which seems a little hypocritical considering the message of the movie that so-called-disabled people can do great things. This is the worst best-loved movie of all time!"
22362,True,"I am not exaggerating when I say that I have seen this film at least fifty times. It never fails to put me in a good mood. I would definitely recommend this film to everyone reading this review. Please watch this film! I watched this film with my mother at the cinema when it first came out and we still watch this film together, at least once a year. This is the prefect family film, or perhaps a film for a couple that wants to curl up with some popcorn. Tom Hanks is truly amazing in this role, and shows how a versatile actor he really is. My favourite thing about this film is how complex and well thought out the plot is, i often feel that writers and directors falter in their simplistic story lines. Forrest Gump will never fail to amuse :)"
22363,True,"*****WARNING: THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**** Adapted from the novel of the same name by Winston Groom, ""Forrest Gump"" is unlike any movie I've ever seen. For the duration of its two-hour run, it enchants and moves, amazes and inspires, seamlessly blending comedy and drama, history and fantasy, threading its spellbinding yarn against the backdrop of some of the defining events in modern American history.""Forrest Gump"" is about Forrest Gump, an everyman from Alabama. While Forrest is none too bright, he can run like the wind, which secures him a scholarship to the University of Alabama. As the film continues, he becomes a footballer, a soldier, a ping-pong champion, a folk hero and a multi-millionaire. He meets Elvis Presley and JFK; exposes the Watergate Scandal; saves lives in the Vietnam War; runs across the United States; becomes a household name as a highly successful shrimping boat captain; makes the cover of Forbes magazine; and inspires John Lennon's iconic record ""Imagine."" And yet, in spite of all these events, the defining moments in Forrest's life are those he shares with Jenny, his childhood sweetheart, who flits in and out of his life as she goes on a downward spiral trying to come to terms with being a survival of physical and sexual abuse by her father when she was a child.It is from these tender and real moments between Forrest and Jenny that the film finds it emotional core. Their relationship develops over the years and ultimately leads to them marrying and having a son together. But even then, Jenny's traumatic past comes back to haunt her, as the years of self-destructive behaviour that it triggered led to her becoming ill with an unknown virus (possibly HIV/AIDS) that tragically claims her life towards the end of the movie. ""Forrest Gump"" is very much a take it or leave it film. It could be viewed as one-dimensional, optimist bilge, about an idiot meandering aimlessly through life, merely getting lucky. Reading between the lines, though, you find a masterpiece, careening between sadness and joy, pain and triumph. Robert Zemeckis' direction is almost flawless; he renders ""Forrest Gump"" with aesthetic quality and flair. It includes soundtrack with contributions from various American artists and, of course, Alan Silvestri, who composes a beautiful piano suite that is magical in itself.Recognising technical and writing merit, the standard of acting in ""Forrest Gump"" is high as to be almost off the scale. Tom Hanks's performance as Forrest Gump accrued Oscar, Golden Globe and SAG awards that he wholly deserved; he plays Forrest's naivety and vulnerability well and his monologue at Jenny's grave was a tearjerker. Robin Wright's portrayal of Jenny - a woman crying out for help - was tender and real and Gary Sinise, playing Forrest's commanding officer in the Army, Lt. Dan Taylor, who loses his legs after being wounded in combat, is superb, flawlessly capturing Lt. Dan's wrath, melancholy and despair and later his redemption and joy. There is no way to define ""Forrest Gump"" as a movie. It can only be defined as art."
22364,True,"This movie suffers from a bad case of ""schizophrenia"". The movie starts out as a story about a boy who overcomes a handicap with a strong single mother (played by Sally Field). The movie could have been then a ""low key"" version of Radio and made a statement about the obstacles one has to overcome. Instead, Zemeckis wanted to make a statement about American history from the 60s to the 80s. The result was a judgmental indictment without regard for the ""complexities"" involved. For example, we are supposed to think that Forrest Gump is so ""dimwitted"" that he doesn't care about civil rights, when a young black woman is trying to attend class. Is Zemeckis mocking civil rights? Then there is something about having to pee while shaking hands with LBJ. I guess some people find this funny, but it just appeared childish to me. Then, Gump goes off to Vietnam, leaving his ""flaky"", ""irresponsible"" girlfriend behind. You get tired easily of his girlfriend being portrayed as an irresponsible child. When he returns from 'Nam, he gets in a fight with some pretentious hippy, who is supposed to represent the entire anti-War movement. This really irritated me seeing all the complex issues of the 60s being used to subjectively attack the anti-war movement. After this slight, the movie moves on to a new story. Now Forrest is running for no reason. In the movie ""Convoy"", where this idea was borrowed from (switching from truckers to runners), there seemed to be a little bit of a political message. Forrest is just running for no rhyme or reason. By the end of the movie, I am just annoyed by his talk about a box of chocolate. This movie was extremely annoying, patronizing, and ignorant. Forrest Gump might of been a better, more honest movie, if Zemeckis stuck to the storyline, instead of pursuing a right-wing political agenda."
22365,True,"It really isn't a good sign when a film has you reaching for the sick bag after only a few minutes.This film features one of Tom Hanks's most insufferable performances, as the eponymous simpleton who embarks on an odyssey across America ( and Vietnam - what did they do to deserve such a fate?). The scene in which Forrest's mother dies inadvertently provided some comic relief after interminable scenes of Gump running across America, meeting Presidents, and maintaining a frankly creepy crush on childhood ""sweetheart"" Jenny.This nauseating piece of reactionary twaddle is something the CIA should consider as a means of extracting information from anyone they saw fit. I'd be screaming for mercy after 10 minutes.And what were the Academy smoking when they gave Hanks an Oscar for this turd? Avoid at all costs - but if you really must watch it a bottle of whisky may numb your senses into submission enough to allow a viewing."
22366,True,"Great movie is great and have a great story and the chocolate looks great at the end. It contains a lot story that has been builded up great and is timed perfect for my eyes the movie makes me laugh every time i watch its okay funny for persons with that humor. its a great story line coming in the right order and have the right persons the right places . It is a big movie everyone have seen it at least one time in there life me in person have seen it more than 5 times at this time so i think its great that we have that great actors in the world. Actors makes a great job in this movie have seen better but in this movie they are special. and i think its great that they have Elvis in the movie i think that he does a lot in the movie. Highly recommend, sorry for spelling mistakes..."
22367,True,"Forrest Gump is so touching and captivating, sensational film, the film is full of great moments, when he is a child, when he decided to run for years, he in the Vietnam war, have fun scenes, Tom Hanks makes his best performance it is impeccable, his character is so childish and naive, the soundtrack is very good, the picture is excellent, the plot is clever, the cast is great, Robert Zemeckis makes a great direction, the end he finds the woman he loves and knows your child is great, the way the story is told is very good, he tells the moments he spent in 40 years at the bus stop, many people says that Forrest Gump did not deserve to get the Oscar Pulp Fiction is the Shawkshank Redemption, I totally disagree, even Pulp Fiction is an amazing film, Forrest Gump fact was the best movie of the year, Forrest Gump is exciting, has a beautiful story, a beautiful soundtrack is an incredible performance of Tom Hanks. Note 10"
22368,True,"There are movies and movies & there is Forrest Gump.Movies that make you laugh, movies that make you ponder,movies that may excite you, but only a few can make you cry. Forrest Gump does it all. Boy, tears rolled down for the first time after watching a movie(of course there are other movies that followed but surely none of those were even close to this phenomenal motion picture). Not that I am Hercules or Thor, but it takes immense poignance to make me cry. Talking about Robert Zemeckis, the man always had a peculiarity in his direction but this is the one which stands tall among all. This story wouldn't have been the same without him. He is the one who brought the feel to this movie. Tom Hanks does not have Tom Cruise's face or Brad Pitt's body & so he got to the best with what God has given him- SHEER ACTING PROWESS. In early 90's he was still to establish himself among great names & thats how he did it? Although he had already won an Oscar for philadelphia but this movie was his official entry to the hearts of millions of people across the globe. Its hard to imagine any other actor fit in this role. His movies have always been like a box of chocolates- YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO COME & this one is a pure delight- a movie that can make your day.Some of the finest dialogs, thrilling moments, funny instances, touching storyline, insightful thoughts & a pinch of romance, this movie offers you everything you are looking in a heartwarming feel-good movie.Robin Wright's performance was a treat to watch and some breathtaking chemistry with Tom Hanks made it even more delicious. Even the best in the romance cannot match this one. ""I may not be a smart man but I know what love is"" is one of my favorite lines in the movie. Stupidity has never been so touchy before.Every single character contributed to this beautiful fable in bits & pieces- Forrest, Jenny, Lt. Dan, Bubba, Forrest's Mama, Young Forrest & Junior Forrest are some of the unforgettable ones. An extraordinary journey of an ordinary man & arguably one of the best performances of all time by Tom Hanks- don't give a miss to this one. It may change your perception about life.One hell of a movie & it will be close to my heart forever! what can I say more"
22369,True,"For anyone who grew up in the turbulent Sixties, ""Forrest Gump"" delivers a clever blend of nostalgia mixed with a uniquely creative view of history as experienced by a presumed to be simpleton. While Tom Hanks' character recalls his life with a slow tangy drawl, he variously entertains and educates a host of passengers waiting for the next bus to their intended destination. Some ignore him, some show interest, one even scorns Gump's tale of getting rich in the shrimping business, only to depart before Forrest has a chance to pull out his copy of Fortune Magazine. Life can be like that for those unwilling to listen and learn, casting doubt instead of exploring the truth and keeping an open mind.I got a kick out of Forrest's string of brushes with greatness - the way he taught Elvis how to shake his hips, his unquestioning response to LBJ's inquiry about his war injury, and the way his war time experience inspired John Lennon to write 'Imagine'. There was also that ingenious sequence in which he meets President Nixon, then inadvertently tips off the Watergate scandal. However the most understated and easiest reference to miss was the clever homage paid to the 1969 film ""Midnight Cowboy"", when Forrest wheels Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise) across busy city traffic, and is narrowly missed by a taxi cab. Lt. Dan's response was ""Hey, I'm walkin' here"", just the way Ratso Rizzo did in that earlier film. All that with the 'Everybody Talking at Me' movie theme seamlessly woven in as so many songs of that era were utilized with other aspects of the story.For Forrest Gump, life is not a pretentious path to wealth or fame, but a never ending quest to learn and be a productive human being. Not to mention finding one's own true love. For Forrest, life long friend Jenny (Robin Wright) represents an unfulfilled ideal, one he accepts into his heart while still a young schoolboy and nurturing that relationship platonically throughout his adulthood. For her part, Jenny represents a youthful quest for experiencing life to the fullest, only to make a series of wrong choices that lead her to the brink of suicide. It's fitting that Jenny eventually realizes what Forrest knew all along, that they were made for each other even if outward appearances seemed to dictate otherwise.I've seen this film only a couple times in the past, thinking it was good, but only considering it for it's entertainment value. I guess one of the benefits of getting older is the insight one gains with experiencing life a day at a time and steady as she goes. My viewing of the picture today gave me a greater appreciation for the subtleties offered in the film, and leads me to believe the world would be a better place if there were a little more of Forrest Gump in all of us."
22370,True,"Forrest Gump is a heartwarming tale about a very different man who just wanted to fit in.Seeing his story throughout the movie made me think ""wow,this guy was some guy"".Forrest Gump was marvelously played by Tom Hanks who i'd only ever seen (well,heard his voice) in Toy Story.I thought it was funny that he was telling random people at the bus stop his life story.I'm glad that they didn't ignore him.Robert Zemecks directed this movie very well because it made perfect sense.I loved Forrest's confidence that he could do anything if he tried.It was such a lovely story,it made me cry,and i'm not that emotional when it comes to movies.The supporting cast was great as was the set design and the picture.Forrest Gump is fantastic and remember,life is like a box of chocolates because it's true,you don't ever know what you'll get.Thanks for that phrase Forrest.10/10"
22371,True,"Spoiler Oooh! The drama! The tragedy! The pointlessness.Forest Gump is the inane story of an insipid person with the usual Hollywood slant. A brain-dead person somehow shapes the course of history and we are supposed to believe it.The drama is over the top and forced. Are we really supposed to cry when his girlfriend dies during the early AIDS years? ""I caught a virus"" she says. Come now now, at that time most of the infected people were promiscuous homosexual men.And in the end we find out that the brain-damaged Gump is wiser than nearly everybody else. This one is so bad it must have Tom Hanks in it."
22372,True,"I really love this film and I have seen it many many times.It is extremely moving and powerful which is exactly what a film (of this genre) should be. If you want to watch a comedy, go watch a comedy, nobody is denying that this is not a romantic-comedy full of belly laughs but it is a real tear jerker and makes you think and Tom Hanks totally deservedly won an Oscar for being such an outstanding actor. It is really a fantastic film, there are not enough ways for me to express that. It makes you think and it touches you and it is *very* hard for the film crew (actors,directors,cameraman etc) to be able to achieve that but they have. I seriously don't understand how people can be so critical and hate this. I do not (well hardly ever) watch a movie expecting to critise it, that is not what movies are for. And *of course* you are not going to like some of the characters because they are not *meant* to be likable!! Thats just how some people are, a film cannot portray everyone as sugary sweet and perfect. I understand that not everybody will think it is fantastic but I do not understand the negative comments, to me they seem silly because I think this is a wonderful film, one of the best ever. The best thing about this film is that it goes through lifes highs and lows just it does for real people."
22373,True,"This movie is unrealistic and personally I didn't enjoy it in the slightest. I hate this movie and have never been impressed. There are plot holes and many scenes where you just want to punch the main characters. The script is atrocious and the acting is horrendous. I have never been more disappointed in a movie. This movie is thought to be touching and classic, but all you see is Tom Hanks and a lot of pointless of love. For once the movie focuses on male love rather than female but it never shows real love. Basically if given the chance I would take this movie off the market because it sets such unrealistic ideas for society."
22374,True,"In 1981, Forrest Gump watches a feather fall from the sky at a bus stop in Savannah, Georgia. He recounts his life story to strangers who sit next to him on the bench, recounting his childhood in the town of Greenbow, Alabama. On his first day of school, Forrest meets a girl named Jenny Curran, whose life is followed in parallel to Gump's at times. Despite his below average intelligence quotient, his ability to run at lightning speed (despite being a victim of polio as a young child) gets him into college on a football scholarship. After his college graduation, he enlists in the army, where he makes friends with fellow recruit Bubba, who convinces Gump to go into the shrimping business with him when the war is over. Despite his low intelligence, Gump manages to excel at drill exercises. They are sent to Vietnam, and during an ambush, Bubba is killed in action. Gump ends up saving much of his platoon, including his Lieutenant, Dan Taylor, who loses both his legs as a result of injuries. Gump is awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism."
22375,True,"Excuse me for the bad English. I want to start by saying this, WHAT A GREAT MOVIE. Since the first second of the movie I was mesmerized by how amazing this movie is, I mean how often do you see a movie that has it all, it's not based on a true story but it contains history elements, like the Vietnam war, the Watergate scandal etc. It's also not biographical but you can see John Lennon& JFK, it's also a romance and a comedy at the same time and of course DRAMA. It's brilliant to be in a movie that was a huge success both commercially with more than 600M$(second most in 1994 behind only THE LION KING)and critically with six Oscars (including Best Picture). Tom Hanks(Oscar winning role)excelled in this movie, and he made the whole world cry with him in the scene when Jenny dies, he did the same thing six years later in Cast Away when he made the whole world cry over a volleyball !!! . ""My momma always said: ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you'll never know what you're gonna get"""", what a quote"
22376,True,"I have nothing to write for this movie. It's just so great job, actors and everything around so I can't describe it. This is the most realistic and beautiful movie I've ever seen! Words can't say how much this movie means for me. I saw it when I was 8-years-old maybe and I said I didn't like it because I didn't understand it, well, I'm 14 now and I have to admit I was seriously wrong. I don't understand people who can hate this movie. Okay, it's their opinion if they don't like it but if they hate it, they don't know what's life. They can't merge with the story of the movie. This movie says so many things how we should all treat to everyone. Forrest was amazing guy and no one liked him just because he wasn't rich or because he had wrong legs. And later? He became popular just because of his acting and opinions. He was himself. All the time. He didn't care if people said if he's stupid, because for stupid person everyone's stupid. That's what most of people forget these days. They fall for others offenses very easily and they forget who they really are. Men these days care only about women and their needs. They don't know how true love looks. That's why I love this movie. Because it's not just a movie. :) It's the movie. The life."
22377,True,"...and it is still my all time favorite. Every couple of years. I first watched when I was 9 years old when I was in China. It was really hard for me understand of the messages the film try to deliver. As I grow up, I have been watching this film from time to time, and I start to understand the history of African American getting equal rights in the society, the fact that Jenny had a miserable childhood and why she was so rebellent as she grow up, and history of Vietnam war, John Lennon, JFK...etc. I can almost always learn something new about the film every time I watch it. This film always inspires me to question my life. As ""normal"" people with normal IQ scores, we though we know what are important and what are things we want. We won't spend time on things that seem not important, and be make decisions and choices based on that. But for Gump, he never made a conscious choice on those important decision in his life: play football, join army, make friend with the shrimp guy, play Pingpong, running cross the country. He didn't choose to do any of these things. Just like the famous line from the movie: Life is like a box of chocolate, and you never know what you will choose. And the feather flying in the sky at the beginning and the end of the film, was the a prefect visual metaphor of this line and Gump's life."
22378,True,"This movie really is spectacular, with Tom Hanks in the title role performing it spectacularly. Forrest Gump, a sweet, little, simple man just chasing his one true love, is such a basic idea for a movie, but is done in a way that is heart wrenching and emotional. By far, this is one of my favorite movies. Few other films really can compare to Forrest Gump in its emotion and overall theme of finding happiness in your everyday life, no matter what life throws at you. And so, I would certainly rate Forrest Gump 10/10 every time, for it's not the most big-budget films that end up being best, it's those which truly strike a chord and bring out the joy in people that can be classified as the best movies. And in the end, that's what movies are about. Bringing joy and happiness, and creating and ideal world even in the worst of times, for in the end, ""all the world's a stage."""
22379,True,"To get a 10 from me, a movie needs to be practically perfect in all aspects that I consider of the utmost importance: screenplay, acting, characters, technical achievement and soundtrack. Forrest Gump achieves that task. First of all, I think screenplay and characters ought to be analyzed together. The story of this movie is absolutely brilliant on its surface. The idea of displaying a naive and low IQ man who witnesses some of the biggest events of the US history during the second half of the XX century was perfectly performed. It was undoubtedly one of the most amusing things that I've ever seen on the screen. However, the movie was for me something beyond that. Forrest Gump, as being the simplest man you could ever imagine, represents the human being at its ""purest condition"". Gump does everything that we would do in the same situation if we weren't pressured by conventions established by society. Most people start drinking beer, for instance, not because they like it, but because they need acceptance from others. Forrest's case is different: he drinks Coke because it tastes better. He decides to mow the lawn because he likes it, regardless of other people's thoughts about that. He loves Jenny without any prejudice or shame, even though she only looks for him when she needs him desperately, representing the rest of the corrupted human race. Summing up, he follows his primal instinct and he is unconsciously immune of everything else. This makes Forrest Gump one of the nicest and well written characters of all time.Nothing would be the same, of course, if it wasn't Tom Hanks in the leading role. He is astonishing, vanishing completely inside the character. Robin Wright is also perfect as Jenny, being able to perform a large amount of feelings among almost two hours and a half. Gary Sinise and Sally Field are also great. Michael Conner Humphreys and Hanna Hall, who performed young Gump and young Jenny, caught our attention from the very beginning.Robert Zemeckis and his team made the movie of their carriers. The visual effects were revolutionary, placing Gump alongside John F. Kennedy and John Lennon and making the audience burst out laughing. Moreover, the rhythm and the editing were perfect and the cinematography was impressive. The soundtrack is also a differential, because it follows perfectly the passage of time. Hence, we enjoy some of the best hits of the 60s, the 70s and the 80s. The original score deserves a mention too. It's simple, beautiful and fits perfectly with the scenes where it appears. Forrest Gump is directed brilliantly, has memorable characters, astonishing and captivating performances, an original and magnificent plot and a marvelous soundtrack. Surely one of the best movies ever made.Vote: 10."

22381,True,"Forest Gump is a movie about a below average man who achieves much than anyone would expect and while being in this journey he entertains us. He is declared below average at school, has got braces in his legs during childhood, has a friend jenny who he loves, has a mother who guides him through thick and thin. After school he joins as rugby player excels at it. After rugby he joins army excels at it. He makes great friends with sergeant and a Bubba. After that he excels at ping pong. Sets a shrimp business, becomes rich, runs for a record distance continuously, gets back home. Gets out to search for jenny, who has been in trouble a lot lately. Gets to know about his kid with jenny, and helps him grow.The movie is simple, emotional, family drama where Tom Hanks is excellent. Great job by director and film makers to create such a movie.I recommend to watch this movie with family.rating: 10/10"
22382,True,"Tom Hanks is an amazing actor and was given the full credit he deserves for his role of Forrest Gump. The movie is an inspiration to anyone and everyone, from war to Elvis Presley, peas and carrots to a box of chocolates, you never quite know whats going to happen to Forrest next. A very unlikely man finds himself in crazy situations where he finds he has a lot to say and I think without this film, we'd all be lost. As well as this, the under-lying love story adds to the thrill of the film. Jenny, his first and only love, who goes suffers greatly, is saved by Forrest even though she tries to disregard him and rejects him from her life."
22383,True,This filmed is one of a kind. It has all genres mixed into one movie. Fabulous cast. The soundtrack is to die for. I want to thank everyone who was apart of this film. It changed my life. It shows a lot of unique parts of history. For those of you who put such a wonderful film down...I don't know what you'd consider a wonderful movie. This is the first film that ever made me cry. It makes me want to go back into the day. It's a film where you'll never forget some of the lines. Hundreds of people react the lines of this movie each day. This movie definitely is one of my favorites. It shows many life lessons. This the best movie Tom Hanks has ever filmed in and he is one of the best known actors of today. I couldn't imagine how much fun the cast of Forest Gump had while filming such a fantastic film. It must have been a lot of hard work but it sure did pay off in the long run.
22384,True,"""You have to do the best with what God gave you,"" says Mrs. Gump. Never realizing just how far her son, Forrest would go. With only an IQ of 75, Forrest goes to prove to his Momma and all of America that disabilities don't have to hold one down. In this modern day version of a fairytale, Tom Hanks accurately mimics a mentally challenged person (Forrest Gump). He convinces audiences that he has a disability through his line delivery, speaking in a slow choppy southern drawl, a sound rather uncomfortable to the ear. Unfortunately we hear this speech quite often as Forrest (Hanks) voices over the entire film, telling his inspirational, somewhat unrealistic life story. In the 1950's Forrest Gump's story begins. He's a child growing up in Southern Georgia, set apart from other children because of his need to wear leg braces. His mother pushes him, never allowing him to believe he is different from anyone else. Although it occurs naturally throughout the film, Forrest's ability to influence history while remarkable, is quite obviously an overextension of reality. From teaching Elvis his first dance moves as a child to winning a football scholarship at the University of Alabama. Gump continues to marvel as he pushes across barriers that people don't believe possible for someone ""like him"". While some may criticize the exaggeration it was intentional by the director, transforming the screenplay into a modern day fairytale. Allowing Forrest to go above and beyond what is capable in real life to plant hope and inspiration to the audience.Another achievement Forrest adds to his list is a war hero in Vietnam. Despite the films main goal being the message not visuals director Robert Zemeckis, a special effects whiz took advantage of the scenes in Vietnam. Down pouring rain, hot wet rain forests, and huge explosions that lite up the screen. Thus turning this family movie into pure action and creating a life like war zone. Later on he demonstrates his vision and the special effects teams' skill by displaying an injury that takes place in the previous war scene. Lieutenant Dan Taylor (played by Gary Sims) suffers a realistic double leg amputee. Forrest doesn't stop at war hero though, he continues to amaze. He runs literally across the entire country for therapeutic relief and opens a successful business which turns Forrest into a millionaire. Here the screenplay continues to emphasize how important morals are through Forrest, that despite his good fortune he continues to portray the definition of a good friend and human being. As the film develops so do Forrest's feelings for Jenny his childhood friend. Here Hanks continues to impress by his complex emotional appeal. Forrest is slow but not unemotional, therefore when Hank expresses his love for Jenny his feelings are somewhat naive and abrupt. Hanks makes the audience believe that Forrest simply feels love, and does not understand the multitude of reasons behind why he and Jenny will never work out. The tale of Forrest Gump may be far-fetched, but in 2 hours and 22 minutes Hanks and Zemeckis do an excellent job of pulling audiences heart strings, reiterating important values that seem too often forgotten."
22385,True,"From Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated director Robert Zemeckis (The Back to the Future Trilogy), this is a remarkable comedy drama based on the novel by Winston Groom. Basically, Forrest Gump (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Tom Hanks) is the low-intelligence but friendly man on a bus stop bench, and telling his life story to all strangers who sit down. The film is basically chronicles of his life accidentally ending up in big events of America between the 1950's and the 1970's, and finding fame and fortune without wanting or asking for it. These include meeting Elvis Presley, being put on an American football team for his running speed, meeting President John F. Kennedy, joining the army for the Vietnam war, becoming a Ping Pong champion, receiving the congressional medal of honour from President Richard Nixon, becoming a shrimp boat captain with his own company and running across America for two years. Within these adventures in his life, he always thinks of those close to him, the love of his life Jenny Curran (Golden Globe nominated Robin Wright Penn), friend Lt. Dan Taylor (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Gary Sinise), friend Pvt. Benjamin Buford 'Bubba' Blue (Mykelti Williamson) and his mother Mrs. Gump (BAFTA nominated Sally Field), and with his low-intelligence he does not realise the significance of his actions. Also starring Siobhan Fallon as Dorothy Harris, School Bus Driver, Alexander Zemeckis (Robert's son) as School Bus Boy, Elizabeth Hanks (Tom's daughter) as School Bus Girl and The Sixth Sense's Haley Joel Osment as Forrest Gump Jr. This is one of those films you cannot ignore, even if some people think not to watch it, but like Forrest says ""I don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but I, I think maybe it's both"" (this explains the use of the feather at the beginning and end). Personally, this is a film I would definitely recommend to see, and not just because of Hanks in what has to be one of his best roles. It won the Oscars for Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Makeup, Best Music for Alan Silvestri (he should have) and Best Sound, it won the BAFTA for Best Special Effects, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. Tom Hanks was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 39 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 40 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.""), it was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for Forrest at Jenny's grave, it was number 37 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 71 on 100 Years, 100 Movies. Very, very good!"
22386,True,"I hated this movie. When it came out and I actually went around saying that people thought I was odd or maybe alien to this planet. But I thought it was the most manipulative, unrealistic, piece of tripe I ever saw. Nothing that happens to Forrest would happen in reality and don't tell me it's a parable, because I don't even think it works on that level. The truth is if I was sitting on a bench with Forrest and he started to tell me his life story, I would get up and leave because strangers who behave that way make me uncomfortable and many people would admit this if they were honest enough to get over the emotional aspects of the story. Jenny was a tramp who didn't love him and slept around and didn't deserve that slavish devotion. And the line ""Life is like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're going to get"" not only makes ""love means never having to say you're sorry"" look profound, but it's untrue to boot. Whitman samplers publish the contents on the inside of the box. So, shoot me. I thought this movie appealed to the worst sentimental instincts of the human race and I resented being asked to go along with it."
22387,True,"I've never seen anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before, and for that matter, I've never seen a movie quite like ""Forrest Gump"". Any attempt to describe him would risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Even a dream....The title character leads viewers through an accidental travelogue of American social history from the early 1960s through the present in this revisionist fable. Vietnam, desegregation, Watergate and more are presented from the perspective of Hanks' lovably slow-witted character as he finds himself embroiled in situations he can't quite comprehend. Academy Award Nominations: 13, including Best Picture, Best Actor--Tom Hanks, and Best Director. Academy Awards: 6, including Best Picture, Director, Actor and Adapted Screenplay The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction, not the formulas of modern movies. Its hero, played by Tom Hanks, is a thoroughly decent man with an IQ of 75, who manages, between the 1950s and the 1980s, to become involved in every major event in American history. And he survives them all with only honesty and niceness as his shields.Yet this is not a heartwarming story about a mentally retarded man. That cubbyhole is much too small and limiting for Forrest Gump. The movie is more of a meditation on our times, as seen through the eyes of a man who lacks cynicism and takes things for exactly what they are. Watch him carefully and you will understand why some people are criticized for being ""too clever by half"". Forrest is clever by just exactly enough.Tom Hanks may be the only actor who could have played the role. I can't think of anyone else as Gump, after seeing how Hanks makes him into a person so dignified, so straight-ahead. The performance is a breathtaking, balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths.Forrest is born to an Alabama boardinghouse owner (Sally Field), who tries to correct his posture by making him wear braces, but never criticizes his mind. When Forrest is called ""stupid"", his mother tells him, ""Stupid is as stupid does."" He turns out to be incapable of doing anything less than profound. Also, when the braces finally fall from his legs, it turns out he can run like the wind. That's how he gets a college football scholarship, in a life story that eventually becomes a running gag about his good luck. Gump, the football hero, becomes Gump, the Medal of Honor winner in Vietnam, and then Gump, the Ping-Pong champion, Gump, the shrimp boat captain, Gump, the millionaire stockholder (he gets shares in a new ""fruit company"" named Apple Computer), and Gump, the man who runs across America and then retraces his steps. It could be argued that with his IQ of 75, Forrest does not quite understand everything that happens to him. Not so. He understands everything he needs to know, and the rest, the movie suggests, is just surplus. He even understands everything that's important about love, although Jenny (Robin Wright), the girl he falls in love with in grade school and never falls out of love with, tells him, ""Forrest, you don't know what love is."" She's a stripper by that time. The movie is ingenious in taking Forrest on his tour of recent American history. The director, Robert Zemeckis, is experienced with the magic that special effects can do, and here he uses computerized visual legerdemain to place Gump in historic situations with actual people. Special effects are also used in creating the character of Forrest's Vietnam friend Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), a Ron Kovic type who, quite convincingly, loses his legs. Using carefully selected TV clips and dubbed voices, Zemeckis is able to create some hilarious moments, as when LBJ examines the wound, in what Forrest describes as ""my butt-ox"". The biggest laugh in the movie comes after Nixon inquires where Forrest is staying in Washington, and then recommends the Watergate. As Forrest's life becomes a guided tour of straight-arrow America, Jenny goes on a parallel tour of the counterculture. She goes to California, of course, and drops out, tunes in, and turns on. Eventually it becomes clear that between them, Forrest and Jenny have covered all of the landmarks of our recent cultural history, and the accommodation they arrive at in the end is like a dream of reconciliation for our society. What a magical movie!"
22388,True,"Most people in the world may have a high IQ than Forrest Gump, but almost nobody may live a life like him. When I first saw this movie 6 years ago, I enjoyed it as a comedy. Now when I watch it again, I see the true meaning of life in it. Life is like a box of chocolates, you never known what you'll get next. An individual may seem so small compared with the whole society, and people may feel upset even desperate when they are in trouble. Forrest Gump has set an example to all of us, that only way to a happy and meaningful life is to love and try to live it to the fullest. I love this film very much and every time when I am upset with things in my life, I'll watch it again."
22389,True,"Movie Critic Title: ""Forrest Gump""By: Julian Castro""Forrest Gump"" is a great movie that almost everybody that likes to watch movies, has some day seen this film, and have thought it is a great movie. I have seen recently this movie two times and in my entire life I have seen it 5 or 6 times and every single time I see it, I become more satisfied and proud that still good movies can be created. This movie was directed by Robert Zemeckis, and its main actors are Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump and Robin Wright as Jenny Curran, Forrest's love throughout the entire movie. This film is a dramatic comedy because you feel as if you were the character, so you acquaint with the protagonist and you fell what he feels during the film. But also this movie has very funny scenes that make you laugh and enjoy the movie much more. This movies takes places in various settings were Forrest Gump goes throughout the film. The most important places are Greenbow, Alabama which was his hometown, also Savannah, Georgia, Vietnam, New York City and Washington D.C. These settings are great places to develop the plot in the film. Forrest Gump is a person that has mental trouble; he has a type of mental retardation. This disability doesn't stop him of doing all of the accomplishments that he achieves throughout the story. What Forrest does is that he follows what his heart wants so he does anything humanly possible to achieve his goals. But Gump's most important goal is to achieve the love of his life, Jenny. Forrest met her since their childhood and since then Gump felt in love with her. So throughout the whole story he tries to achieve his aim with her.In this, very well directed film; the actors did a great job making their specific roles. For example the protagonist of the story Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) was a great actor in this film, because he never overacted in any scene of the movie. Hanks is the perfect actor to do the role of the main character because has a lot of experience in doing a lot of films and most of them are loved by the public. So my personal thought is that Tom Hanks was chosen to be the protagonist actor because of his great quality in the art of acting. Also a great actress was Robin Wright and she did the role of Jenny Curran. She did a great job in her part and she also has the natural ability of being another great main actress and does it flawlessly without overacting. Robert Zemeckis (director) did a great decision by choosing those actors and because of his awesome decision this movie turn out being a great movie. ""Forrest Gump"", in general, it has very unique scenes. Personally, I liked the beginning of the film because I thought it was a very unique part, which Forrest starts telling some of his life experiences and things that happened to him that had a big impact on him, to a woman that was seated next to him in a bus. This is the only movie that I've seen that it starts like this one. Also a very nice part in the film is when Forrest was talking with Jenny about his experience in Vietnam, and Jenny was paying close attention to what was Forrest saying to her. This was an amazing part because Jenny told Forrest, after his experiences, that she loved him. This was a very powerful part because we see that Forrest felt great after those words.This movie is known for having many different moral and life lessons. This movie tells us that people that have mental problems such as Forrest Gump can succeed. The only limitation for you is you, this means that I you want to achieve something no matter what, if you have dedication and effort to achieve that something, you will reach that goal. Also another moral lesson that this movie shows us is that war is not needed to have an agreement. This movie tells us that war is bad and it can affect many people's lives and families. Also the last lesson that ""Forrest Gump"" taught us was that don't give up, what we need to do is to try as hard as we can to pass through the obstacles that life puts us in front. A clear example of this lesson is Forrest, life was hard to him because he was handicapped but with some effort and hard work he succeeded in everything he did. I think people that watch this movie will see similar moral lesson, because the movie is trying to teach us the lessons that I mentioned in the paragraph.This PG-13 film is a great movie that anybody that is above 13 years old can watch. But I specially recommended it to people that failed in life, so that this movies teaches them that they still have an opportunity to stand up from that failure and learn from it. I would not recommend this movie to people that don't have a open mind, because they wont learn from their errors or from their mistakes, but generally I recommended to almost everybody. Finally, this movie is a marvelous piece of art, because it is wonderful movie to watch and every time you see it you learn something new that will help throughout life or in future real life situations.Scale of 1-10: 9.5Julian Castro is a 10th grader critic from Lincoln School.

22390,True,"Having seen the movie and read the book, I feel it necessary to make an observation. Even though the movie is based on the book, it is remarkably different. In the book, Forrest goes into space; Bubba is white and meets Forrest in college; Forrest runs as a candidate in the senate; Forrest does not serve under Lieutenant Dan in the Army, but meets him in hospital afterwards; Forrest's mother and Jenny do not die (they do kick it in Gump & Co. though); and there is also Forrest's wrestling career and his friendship with the orangutang Sue that should be mentioned too. The book is a fantastic piece of literature and should be on every college syllabus everywhere. But if the film had been taken directly from the book, I doubt it would have been so successful. The film includes fantastic sequences (Forrest running and influencing pop culture; Forrest directly influencing John Lennon) that do not appear in the book. The way Forrest is tied into the last 40 years of American History is great, if a little convenient. I wonder though, whether the sequel will follow Gump & Co. or whether they will create another new monster."
22391,True,"OK, before I tear this movie to shreds, exactly HOW many Academy Awards did the stupid thing win? No, wait, don't tell me. I have a feeling the answer will depress me.This hype--er, movie--is a living testament to the fact that the baby boomers are incredible suckers. It's quite simple, really. You make a movie that romanticizes the '50's, '60's and '70's, and with enough publicity and a good enough soundtrack, no matter how bad the movie is, you have a hit on your hands. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the generation is stupid or shallow by any means; I'm merely saying that perhaps the haze of nostalgia that obstructed their view of the movie screen during Forrest Gump is what made this trash a hit.Because Forrest Gump is one ridiculous, unbelievable joke followed by another, and when Forrest isn't teaching Elvis how to dance, giving Lennon the idea for ""Imagine"" or, in an embarrassing scene I only WISH I could call ""forgettable"", wiping his face on a clean shirt and making a smiley face with the dirt by accident (""Have a nice day,"" he says to the man who gave him the shirt, thankfully ending one of the ""clever"" scenes that surely had everyone rolling in the aisles); his life is taking another depressing turn that makes this less ""feel-good movie of 1994"" than ""number 1 movie of 1994 to commit suicide to"". He's born crippled with an IQ of 75; the neighborhood kids taunt and throw rocks at him; his ""girlfriend"" Jenny leads him on hopelessly while sleeping with every man in America except for him; his best friend dies in Vietnam and his superior has his legs blown off. Feelin' good yet? Oh, it gets better.But even if Forrest Gump IS depressing, that doesn't make it a bad movie. What makes it bad is, as I said before, the silliness. Sure, putting him in all those vintage newsreels is cute and even pretty cool to see. But the cuteness wears thin pretty soon, and is replaced by more ridiculous events in which Forrest inadverently alters NEARLY EVERY IMPORTANT EVENT IN AMERICA, FOR THREE ENTIRE DECADES. Maybe that's appealing to some people, but not for me. For me, it makes the movie completely unbelievable, and what's more, stupid. This is not cute, and I certainly wasn't feeling good when I realized I'd wasted over two hours of my life listening to Forrest Gump's preposterous anecdotes.In the end, the movie's few saving graces--the good but predictable soundtrack (""For What it's Worth"" by Buffalo Springfield in a Vietnam scene...great! Only 300 other movies before have done the exact same thing!), and the interesting effects with the newsreels--fail to rescue this bomb from the clutches of mediocrity. Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis can have Oscars coming out of their friggin' ears, for all I care...this movie will only ever amount to a 5 out of 10 in my book."
22392,True,"More hollow patriotic nonsense from Hollywood, if Zemeckis is going to insist on trying to rewrite the past could he at least make it interesting as in the first two Back to the Future films.The moral of the film is ultimately that despite how stupid you might be, or whatever historical connections with the KKK you have, if you play sports and join the army you can be a good old all American hero. hardly fascinating stuff. I watched this film in theaters in the US and people were cheering at the Vietnam scenes and when Forrest gets his share at Apple Mackintosh. Saw this film again in Britain and the same scenes were greeted with the deserved apathy and boredom. I think that says it all.If you are interested in seeing a very patronizing and shallow movie about recent American history, then this film is for you."
22393,True,"One of Oscar's low moments had to be in awarding this picturebest film, best director, and best lead actor. The movie's nothingbut a pastiche of sentimentalism and forced nostalgia, strungtogether with soundbytes and pasted-in beautiful visuals, like aHallmark card glued onto celluloid.The whole schtick of having Forrest appear at ""key moments"" inthe 60s and 70s is just a sort of emotional rorshach blot on film,designed to allow the viewer to see whatever she or he wants.Even the soundtrack is a formulaic greatest hits soundtrack.Vietnam? Creedence! Drug scene in the early 70s? The Doors!Want to relive the running craze of the 70s? Jackson Browne's""Running on Empty!""  Yes, the movie is that achingly literal.I'm also stunned Hanks got best actor for this film. Hollywoodreally does love actors playing ""special"" people, doesn't it? (DustinHoffman in Rainman, Billy Bob Thornton in Sling Blade, etc. )Hanks is a professional, to be sure, but given the plotless text andthe range of emotions in the character (the whole gamut fromscared and stupid to confused and stupid), it wasn't a whole lot towork with.In an allegedly enlightened era, too, there's a lot of humour in thismovie which is basically, ""look at how stupid this retarded guy is!he doesn't know his mother's whoring! he doesn't know a shrimpboat isn't a tiny little craft! he doesn't get ironic humour like we do!ha ha ha ha ha!"" Pair him up with another such person in theVietnam sequences, ha ha, it's so funny the two dummies don'tknow the other one is a dummy! So to compliment the trite,non-dramatic sentimentalism, we have sophomoric comedy at theexpense of the mentally retarded.The one curiousity is an early performance by Haley Joel Osmentas, of course, a preturnaturally loquacious but cute mop-toppedurchin (spoiler coming) named Forrest Gump Junior."
22394,True,"Just came across your words, and I couldn't have said it better myself. What's really insulting to me is the film's Republican wet dream worldview. Basically the message here is that if you keep your mouth shut and don't question authority, you will become a great man (if you're a free-spirited hippie, you'll die an early death alone). Of course Gump is a ""simpleton""; any complex opinions might likewise bring out similar thoughts in the audience, and we can't have that is a big shiny Hollywood movie. (Yeah, Gump tried to speak out in DC, but the microphone went screwy...silenced by THE MAN! :) )  And what's with the ending? Let's see, AIDS, death, marriage, another death - all in twenty minutes.  Jeez, it's shameless.
NO WAY this is better than Shawshank! Morgan Freeman's performance both breaks my heart and fills me with hope (pretty much what Hanks tried and failed to do - and he won the friggin' Oscar).  And Pulp Fiction changed audience's and Hollywood's perception of what a film can be, something that Gump didn't even attempt. It sucks. IT SUCKS. Still, always great to see Sally Field..."
22395,True,"People are always amazed when I talk about how much if loathe this movie but let's face it, how else should one treat a movie that encourages people to drift through life and tells you that anything that attacks conformity and inspires change is evil. When Forrest asks a girl why she doesn't love him, we are expected to feel sorry for a narcissistic retarded fellow who doesn't see why someone couldn't fall in love with a brain-damaged freak. a film that dehumanizes the counter-culture, makes history seem like a mere play-thing to the idiotic and shows that if you just float through life, you'll last much better than those egg-heads atheists commie pinkos who tried to survive and were sent to Hell by the Almighty."
22396,True,"I loathe and despise this film on so many different levels.Firstly, how did Tom Hanks win an Oscar for speaking very slowly. I have never seen such a collective display of acting incompetence be so highly lauded.Secondly, The central message of this film is (spoilers) America is better than everywhere else in the world. Don't get me wrong, I like America. I love Americans, I waste massive amounts of my time and money on movies, music, and books produced in America- but this bloody movie is a typical of why so many people now seem to be anti-US. If you look at the lengths the ""good"" characters go to conform to society's ideal- his mother having sex with the principal, for example- they will behave in an immoral fashion to further their own lives within the American ideal. Furthermore, just in case this subtle point flew over the heads of the audience, the sole character to attempt to break from this conformity is killed with AIDS.Thirdly, I know it is a movie, a work of fiction etc, so there must be some suspension of disbelief, but this simply goes to far. How does a mentally handicapped kid from a redneck backwater manage to meet a significant amount of noteworthy 20th century figures, and be present at so many of the last centuries significant events? Also, why does no-one tell him where to go when he is waffling on at the bus stop?Next Up- no-one ever seems to comment on this, but this film is BORING. It is a string of randomly connected events, some of which are so tedious that when I first saw it I literally felt my brain melting. For example (spoiler) when he goes running for god knows how long for no apparent reason- then stops again for no apparent reason. The sheer pointlessness of this section made me want to cry out of frustration. This film is 2 hours and 20 minutes long- not an epic by any stretch of the imagination, but at least half an hour over time. The running section could easily (for example) have ended up on the cutting room floor without detracting from the movie in any way. This is actually typical of so much of the movie- (spoilers) Elvis does not add anything to the plot (except irritation), the table tennis scenes, the section with the prostitutes in New York, I could go on and on but frankly cannot be bothered. The basic storyline, as reliant as it is on suspension of disbelief etc, is essentially quite simple. (spoiler)Retarded boy from red neck backwater attends several famous events and through god's good graces and America's providence has a fabulously successful life, whilst losing the only woman he ever loved, and making some life-long friends. Easy, biographical story, not without a heartwarming premise. Instead we have a bloated, appalling, falsely moralistic, repugnant propaganda sequence constructed from a series of irritating set pieces and laden with pseudo-meaningful interludes. Why was it not made as a simple fictional biopic?Finally, I am not pro-feminist at all, but this movie made my stomach turn in it's treatment of the female characters. All the women of the movie are morally loose- whether it is his mother, love of his life (the only two complete female characters anyway), or any of the minor characters (two hookers leaps to mind), they all display a worrying lack of morals.Overall this movie is 140 minutes of my life that I want back. I feel violated for having seen this saccharine wrapped pile of excrement- I think I have given enough reasons for why it is the worst movie of all time without even going into it's wallowing in sentimentality, or dismal direction, or even looking at the waste of fine actors (Sally field, Gary Sinese etc). That Tom Hanks won his second Oscar for this overrated pile of garbage shows what an absolute travesty the Academy voting system is."
22397,True,"Forrest Gump is the story of a guy with a low IQ and his journey through life, encompassing the homespun apple pie America of the 50s when everything was rosy and American interventionism led the world against the evil Communists, the horrible 60s when those nasty dirty hippies tried to usurp American Interventionism and God-given right to invade other people by protesting against the Vietnam War. (Shock, horror, Nixon was right all along!) and the crisis-torn 70s, when all those nasty hippies were now drug-addicted Aids carriers that caused American Interventionism and God-given etc, etc.You get the point. The issues raised in the movie were far more complex than the mindset on display here, with good and bad on both sides of the argument. America is a wonderful country with wonderful people, but it can't feel good about itself so the film-makers just rewrite history so it CAN feel good about itself. It takes more than a movie of course but apparently people want to be convinced that Interventionism is not such a bad idea; still working well, isn't it? Gump's a decent guy, of course. He isn't judgemental for one thing. Perhaps if we were all afflicted with similar IQs no one would question anything, and American Interventionsm etc etc....I liked Gary Sinise's performance as the war veteran amputee, just another decent guy who has every reason to feel bitter. Pity the movie then has his character rounding on the left-wing draft dodgers and hippie protesters who didn't go to Vietnam, but tried to stop the conflict; perhaps he would better off rounding on the people who sent him there in the first place???This is a great movie for reactionaries. ""God damn it, I told ya that was the way it was!"" Bet they all give it a 10."
22398,True,"There are many ways that this movie turned my stomach. The idea that a mentally challenged man can achieve such successes in life pushed me way beyond my ability to suspend disbelief. Just one example among many: was I supposed to believe that Gump could be a successful football player on the University of Alabama team? How did he even get into the university? Given the tone of the movie I doubt that this was meant as a sarcastic comment on the intelligence of college football players, but that is how I saw it. It's an insult to real players who have worked hard to get on a team.All right, so I should just view this as some feel-good fantasy, yes? But there were some scenes that were played for real: Gump's buddy in the Vietnam war being fatally shot in the guts, his girl friend dying of AIDS, his mother dying of cancer. Such mixtures of realism and fantasy have never worked for me.Putting the above matters aside, there are more serious concerns. The message of this movie, that being mentally challenged is only a minor impediment to achieving great successes in life, is objectionable. How are parents dealing with the real problems that mentally challenged children have in this world supposed to react to this message? Or the mentally challenged themselves? Or everybody else for that matter.I was highly offended by this movie."
22399,True,Forest Gump is an amazing film. I thought it was brilliant and Tom Hanks as Forest was just amazing. I loved the way the storyline worked and how he talked about his life in flashbacks to different people who were waiting with him. I must admit I did cry twice in this movie. All in all it will be on my top ten list. This movie will never get old no matter how many years it has been out for. Even though they talk in a Southern Accent it is still amazing. I think the whole aspect of Forest Gump is amazing and I never expected it to be that good the first time I watched it. Now I cannot stop watching it. I have seen this movie so many times and still not over it. I would recommend this movie to people because it certainly is a classic.
22400,True,"I love this movie so much. It works as a comedy, and it teaches you really important life lessons. I admit, when I first saw this movie, I wasn't used to Tom Hanks and his southern accent. But this simpleton shows that you can do anything you want in life if you set your mind to it. I laughed at the times when Forrest says stuff that ""Mama"" used to say. And I really liked all the historical references like Vietnam, Watergate Scandal, and possibly the invention of the smiley face. Forrest shows us that anyone can achieve big things in life, even if you aren't capable. He gets the Medal of Honor, saving lives, and he didn't need to beef up on strength or anything. He didn't even have to pick up a ping pong paddle at an early age to be a master at ping pong. And he didn't even need to be a track star to run a cross country journey for a really long time. This movie really taught me to never give up."
22401,True,I loved the movie. I watch it as much as I can. Its great. I especially love the Vietnam part of the movie. I find it great how it shows compassion and romance yet a troubled story of a man. I think my favorite character is Lieutenant Dan. He is a cocky son of a bitch but damn he is cool. This movie is great for kids. It might even teach them a good lesson about life. This movie is excellent in every way. It is way better then some of these new movies. I love the story and plot. Jenny is a bitch though. She doesn't understand how much Forest loves her and she always pushes him away. Until she really needs him when they have a child together. Forest goes through a lot in this movie but he perseveres and keeps going and thats great. This is definitely my favorite movie by far.
22402,True,"This is the 3rd best movie I've seen. I love everything about this movie. The acting, the story, and how almost every big news event from the 1950s to the 1980s finds it's way in this film. Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a kid from Alabama with a low IQ of 75 and with braces on his legs. He meets a girl named Jenny Curran (Robin Wright) and they become good friends. Forrest starts to lead an extremely productive life. Despite his low IQ he is accepted into the University of Alabama and becomes part of the all American team. While there he witnesses George Wallace stand in the door, to keep African American students out. When he graduates he joins the US Army and serves in the Vietnam War. He befriends a fellow boot camp recruit, Private Benjamin Buford ""Bubba"" Blue (Mykelti Williamson) who has a dream of going into the shrimping business and his platoon commander Lieutenant Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise) who regards it as his destiny to die in combat like his ancestors before him had all done. In one part the platoon is ambushed by the Viet Cong. All the men are wounded. Forrest takes all the wounded men and brings them to safety, including Lieutenant Dan. Bubba dies and Lieutenant Dan is angry with Forrest for not letting him die in combat. In the Army hospital Forrest takes a liking to Ping Pong and becomes the Ping Pong champion, and receives the Medal of Honor for saving everyone. In Washington DC he meets Jenny again who has lead a life that is the opposite of Forrest's. She moves from failure to failure as she becomes a hippie and takes drugs while Forrest goes to China to play Ping Pong for the US against the Chinese team. He meets Lieutenant Dan in New York, New York who has now fallen into depression and is still mad at Forrest for leaving him a cripple. Forrest retires from the Army and goes to become Captain of a shrimp boat like Bubba wanted to do. Lieutenant Dan later becomes his first-mate and they begin to own a very successful shrimping business. Forrest meets Jenny again and they spend more time together before she leaves again. Then Forrest for no reason at all decides to take a long run all over Alabama at first and then all over the country. He meets Jenny again who now has a son named Forrest Jr. (Haley Joel Osment) and shortly after wards Forrest and Jenny are married, and their wedding is attended by Lieutenant Dan. Later Jenny sadly dies. The film ends as Forrest is waiting for the school bus to come by and pick up Forrest Jr. on the same tree stump that Forrest's mother (Sally Field) had waited by on Forrest Sr.s first day of school. I highly consider this to be Tom Hanks's best role in any movie he's done. I certainly recommend this film to everyone."
22403,True,"I think this movie is very good because it shows that no matter who person is, he can do everything what he wants. This is the most amazing and beautiful story about intelligence and love. The film shows that everything is possible if you want to and you can beat every difficulty if you have a dream. I saw this movie 2 times and I'm proud that I've watched it, because every time I'm watching this movie, it makes me to realize that the world can be cruel and beautiful in same time and if people are nice, they can accept you the way you are. If you distrust yourself, then you really must to see this movie. It will change your mind about yourself, the people you are surrounded and the world that you live."
22404,True,"I've never met anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before, and for that matter I've never seen a movie quite like ""Forrest Gump."" Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try.And yet this is not a heartwarming story about a mentally retarded man. The movie is more of a meditation on our times, as seen through the eyes of a man who lacks cynicism and takes things for exactly what they are. Watch him carefully and you will understand why some people are criticized for being ""too clever by half."" Forrest is clever by just exactly enough. He's a thoroughly decent man with an IQ of 75, who manages between the 1950s and the 1980s to become involved in every major event in American history. And he survives them all with only honesty and niceness as his shields.Tom Hanks may be the only actor who could have played the role. I can't think of anyone else as Gump, after seeing how Hanks makes him into a person so dignified, so straight-ahead. The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths.What a magical movie."
22405,True,"I know I'm not the only one who hated this movie. In fact I'm not even the only person in my family that hated this movie, my mom and sister did too, and I have met other people who hated this movie throughout the years since it came out. Unfortunately, it hasn't been too many people at all.Enough of that, I of course looked and heard why people seem to like this movie so much. But I couldn't disagree more. The whole plot of the movie is ridiculous -- how a mentally challenged person could go through or cause all these historical events and fads. For example, creating the smiley face, the s*** happens bumper sticker, catching the people in the Watergate scandal, winning a medal of honor, becoming a ping-pong champion (like an American can ever win that!), becoming an all-American athlete for football, running across the country, falling in love with a drug-addicted stripper (well i guess this one's believable as he is mentally challenged), speaking out against the Vietnam war after he won the medal of honor for it, etc. STUPID, STUPID, STUPID. Running some more, STUPID, STUPID, STUPID. Then just quitting for no apparent reason, STUPID, STUPID, STUPID!!!!OK, now the good parts of it. Yes there are some things I liked about the movie. The cinematography was beautiful (and I'm a big fan of this as I believe it helps set the tone of a movie), but it's useless because there is nothing for it to enhance. I also liked Gary Sinise in this; Lt. Dan is actually a cool character. And of course, the soundtrack is awesome...Now only if we can mute everyone but Gary Sinise and the music, I might be able to sit through this movie again. One can only hope...Now back to the not so good to outright horrible. I never read the book by Winston Groom so I can't say if they did the book justice or not, and I really don't care. I mentioned how much I hated the basic premise for this movie, but the dialog doesn't help either, with it's cheesy axioms and pathetic southern accents (I used to live in TN, and I don't remember the accents being that bad). Whatever, I can live with the accents, but I prefer the exaggerated ones in ""Fargo"" (I thought they sounded cool). Anyway, now onto the acting: Tom Hanks wasn't great in this movie at all. How hard is it to play somebody that doesn't change from one scene to the next. He walks, talks, and acts the same in every scene of the movie. This had to have been Hanks' easiest performance to play...and it won him his second Oscar. But of course this isn't the first time that's happened. See Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain Man,"" but at least that was a good movie.I like a lot of Robert Zemeckis's films by the way to include ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" ""Contact"" and even ""Beowulf,"" but this one, he asked way too much for me to believe. I actually think the events of ""Star Wars 1-6"" were more likely to have occurred than the events in this movie. A lot has been said about his right wing political agenda; I don't care; it's his movie, he can do what he wants with, but I don't have to agree. Also that this movie is stereotypical to blacks. I always wondered what African Americans thought about some of the stuff in it as I don't think it was meant to be racist, but some of it kind of came off like it. I guess it's up to them to decide.Now onto the last part of my comment which doesn't have anything to do with why I like/dislike any part of the movie. I've been called a Communist, un-American, and other worse things for hating this movie. Really what is the point. I don't put other people down for not liking movies I like. Everybody's is entitled to their own opinion. Furthermore, I thought I lived in (and fought for) a country where I can like or dislike whatever movie I want. I don't like movies because everyone else does, and just because Hollywood or the media says that a movie is good, doesn't mean that it is. In fact I tend to disagree with Hollywood a lot. Anyway, isn't having to like something that's jammed down my throat communist in itself? Anyway, if I had to choose between becoming a communist and liking this movie, I would choose communism without a second thought or regret.If I was rating this movie on how much I actually liked it, I would give it a -infiniti just on the stupid screenplay alone. Too bad, it took awhile for ""The Shawshank Redemption"" to get popular, or that would have swept the Oscars that year."
22406,True,"In ""Forrest Gump"", Tom Hanks and Gary Senise are brilliant along with the rest of the cast. From start to finish, most everyone will love this flick. I can't find fault with this movie, and I am shocked by some of the negative comments on this forum because it is a truly great film.I've watched this movie at least 10 times and I just love it. This movie is filled with all the emotions done with precision. Just sit back and enjoy it. In some ways it is so light on the outside and so profound in other ways. This is a wonderful movie for all ages and is so very deep. You will die laughing and also cry your eyes out. All you need is a pulse and you will love this movie for ever. 10 out of 10! One of the most memorable movies of all time."
22407,True,"""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies ever made! It made a HUGE impact on me when I saw it in 1993.If you haven't seen this one, you should go out and rent it when you get the chance. Tom Hanks has never been better, and the rest of the cast I have no complaints to make. I haven't seen them so much before, but as far as I can see they should all have won an Oscar for best performance! If it could be possible, my biggest wish right now is that there could be a second movie coming out soon. Then we would see how it has gone for Forest and his friend Lt.Dan. If they have made more money or if they have lost it all. (Not that I believe they would have lost it, with the luck that Forest has). As i final comment, I have to say that this movie has given me so much joy through the years.Much like ""Sound of Music"" did for that generation, this film does for our times!"
22408,True,"After all the hype surrounding this movie and its subsequent showing at the Oscars, i thought i knew enough about this movie to know it wasn't going to be my type of flick. ""..feel-good fodder for the dumbed down American masses...simple boy leads extraordinary life in an over-simplified excursion thru post war America.... over-hyped, over-rewarded.. lacking realism and believable characters.""that would have been some thing like the review i might have given prior to watching this film.having now seen the film ( thru a rather sad of anything else to do on Saturday night)i would not change much about what i've already said about the film except to say , if possible it was even worse than i feared.Not once did i feel any pathos for Gump. his low IQ was mainly used as a convenient plot device to explain all the unbelievable things that happened to him. Who can believe a guy who runs across America for 3 years just because he felt like it all of a sudden? If all the things that happen to Gump really happend to one person, that person would be a national celebrity if not an icon. Yet Gump seems to end the movie as a relatively anonymous character. Some might say this adds to the charm of the story, that this guy could be involved in all these extraordinary happenings without really knowing the consequences of his actions and what was going on around him. I think this merely adds to the flawed nature of the film. SPOILER ALERT Having said all of this, the movie maybe has one redeeming feature.My girlfriend was in tears by the end when Jenny dies. Maybe this works as a love story.  But i wouldnt watch this film just on that basis. In fact i won't ever watch this film again unless someone offers me a serious amount of money, which lets face it is about as realistic as most of this movie!"
22409,True,"I remember hearing so much about this film and after a great year at the box office that had seen the release of Pulp Fiction and the underrated intersection, I thought that this film, from the director of ""Back to the future"" would surely not fail to the disappoint.Boy was I wrong. Bob Gale must have thanked God that Zemeckis hired someone else for this self-absorbed piece of tripe. The film resembles the films of the eighties that were trying to show female empowerment by having them think and act like men, that you watch now with a odd sense of embarrassment. That's what this film is to the disabled. It tries hard to seem so enlightened and yet most of the film's attitude is mocking. The way he just happens to become a football hero, because lets face it, in America if you're disabled then that's the only way to get acceptance from Bullies. Firstly why would someone want acceptance from Bullies and more importantly what the hell does that say about the world that this is the message Zemeckis is sending out.The film then becomes a horrible mish-mash as Tom Hanks is badly imposed in old film clips of chat shows and presidents, and the only plus of the film comes in the shape of a great performance by Gary Sinese that is spoilt by a cheesy ending where he forgives the Vietnamese by falling for a Vietnamese woman (Kind of like a really naff version of my name is earl.) If there is any justice in this world then this will fall down the list and out of the 250, but unfortunately the world is not just and if this film indicated that, then it would have a higher ranking from me."
22410,True,when I 1st seen this film it inspired me in a lot of different ways of how he was treated growing up from others and what he went through in life to get where he is now. he also help a lot of people on his way because he never wanted to see people like bub gums family be in such bad shape and he took care of his family and that shows there is still great people out there in this world from off the movie. the he tried to help captain Dan out when he visited him in his apartment. puts Dan on the ship Jennie and made him his captain. as for Jennie she was hanging around the black panther party and her boy friend that was not for war. she had wasted almost all of her life partying and doing drugs with the wrong people I think.
22411,True,"One of the most inspiring movie of all time.If you find yourself vulnerable or sad, this movie shows how to deal with it, although don't try to run across USA, unless you felt like it, :))Good behaviors can get you far, they might mistake you as stupid but sometimes stupid acts gives us some wisdom to learn and be tough to overcome our obstacles,'Stupid as stupid does'.Forrest is a very resilient, good friend, and always looks to the bright side of life. He has more character than a normal person as we speak.His loves for his Mama cannot be compared. And he takes in, all the wisdom she taught to him very seriously, even we find it silly/irrelevant at times."
22412,True,"I'll keep this short and simple.Forrest is a simple man that doesn't ask much out of life and ends up living what some would call the luckiest life in the history of cinema. Except it isn't.Dig a little deeper and you'll find some very simple yet profound truths. The most important thing in life are the relationships we have with others, not the things that we accomplish or obtain. And Forrest loses almost everyone that is important to him throughout the course of the movie. He's a simple man, but he knows what love is.On the other side is Jenny, who's entire story is summed up when Forrest says the deceptively profound ""sometimes I guess there just aren't enough rocks."" For her scars, there weren't.Watch it again. Dig a little deeper. Then you'll come to understand why this is considered a timeless classic."
22413,True,"I watched this a very long time ago, but I never really appreciated this movie. It must have been because I was very young. I wasn't even born when the movie first aired! However, I do remember a few scenes from this movie. The ones that stuck with me throughout the years were the very, very sad scene of Bubba dying and the oh-so-famous quote: ""Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."" This movie starts with a feather floating in the background, getting flown all over in the place, when finally it lands beside some dirty rubber shoes. The owner of these shoes, Forrest Gump, picks it up and keeps it. He just sits there, quietly all by himself, when a woman sits beside him on his bench. He then greets her and thus, begins the narration of his life story.His story is wonderful. I loved everything about it. Forrest wasn't exactly the brightest crayon in the box. On top of that, he couldn't even walk properly. His IQ was a poor 75 and he couldn't even get accepted into a public school. But his mother did everything for Forrest. His mother was great. You could see she struggling.I thought it was very cute the way Jenny and Forrest's friendship blossomed. How she invited him to sit beside her. The way they hung around with each other in their tree and just talked about anything and everything. Jenny was very protective of Forrest. When the first bullying encounter happened and Jenny told Forrest to run? That made my skin have goosebumps. It just felt good. ""Run, Forrest! Run!"" I also never realized back then that Jenny was having trouble with her father. But now, I understand. Jenny's prayer was also.. Amazing. ""Dear God, make me a bird. So I could fly far. Far far away from here."" That just touched me.After his friendship with Jenny, Forrest met Bubba during the Vietnam War, after he finished college. During the scene where Forrest first entered the bus, it was like the first day of school all over again! Nobody would let Forrest sit with him. Until he came upon a guy who had a weird lip jutting out. That was the start of their strong brotherhood.I felt like the time they spent together was so short. I didn't even cry when Bubba died. It was weird since I was expecting to cry, seeing as how Bubba's scene was the one that stayed with me all throughout the years. I'm so disappointed in my lack of emotional attachment. But I still love Bubba. :) It was nice how Forrest went on with his shrimp catching business just for the sake of keeping his promise to Bubba.The two things that changed during my previous screenings and the one I had tonight were 1.) I liked Lt. Dan more than I thought I would and 2.) Jenny wasn't all that great.I'll talk about Lt. Dan first. First of all, I didn't even remember him! I was even shocked when I saw that his legs were cut off! See how much that ""didn't"" affect me. But he was a good friend. He became one of Forrest's best friends. He even stood up for him when one of the hookers called Forrest stupid. I thought Dan didn't care, but that proved me wrong. They even became partners with the whole Bubba-Gump thing. Sweet.Now, about Jenny. I don't see why Forrest liked her. Yes, I get that they were friends since childhood, but after they grew out of their childhood, she kept leaving him! I was so mad after she left him during ""the morning after"". At least that sparked Forrest's will to run all over America. Hm.The ending was great. I forgot all about that. What a welcome surprise. It's just a shame that Jenny died, too, in the end. All of Forrest's loved ones passed away. All he's got left is Little Forrest. I guess in a way, that was nice. He had someone to look after and someone to look after him. :) There were a lot of great cameos that I was on a look out for. I loved that Elvis part! I even took a second look to check if that guy was really Elvis! Yes. I know. It's impossible since he's already dead, but hey! It seemed realistic. There were also meetings with different presidents. And a deal he had with a very famous ""fruit company"". The cameos just kept coming and coming. And it worked! The main message of this movie was that life just keeps on going. Bad things are inevitable, but you can trust that there will be a million good things that will come your way. It's a movie about life. Forrest Gump teaches you things. He sees the world from a different viewpoint. Not an idiot's viewpoint. But a child-like sort-of perspective. No biases at all. Just an average things-the-way-they-actually-are perspective. This is one movie you mustn't dare miss. Wonderful movie. Just wonderful."
22414,True,"I have this in my collection it is by far the most played movie I own. I love the simplicity of it, while at the same time being a complex tale of how so many of recent history's pivotal moments involved the same man. From the simple reference of Forrest teaching Elvis to dance, to meeting Presidents as an adult. I love the music and the scenery, the costuming and the special effects, which although now are common in movies, for their time were ground breaking in the way they were done with such detail. And it is the detail of this movie that makes it work so well. For instance when Lt DAN is on the floor in the motel room and spins around, his ""missing legs"" do not get caught on the table in the centre of the room. This was done by filming the scene without the table in the room so that Gary Sinise could move, then placing it back later to reinforce that this character had no legs. It is the sort of detail that is rarely noticed, unless it is not addressed. But most of all I love the fact that at heart it is really just a simple story of a man's love for his one true love, Jenny, a tortured soul who was so mismatched for him in so many ways that it was always going to be impossible for them to be together but this did not stop Forrest carrying her in his heart throughout all his adventures. It is easy to see why this movie was an award winner and remains my favourite movie of all time."
22415,True,"Forrest Gump An absolute film favourite of mine, mainly because there has never been a movie character that I have appreciated so much as Forrest Gump. A simple man who experiences (and creates) some of the most significant events in American history, while all he really wants is to be with the woman he loves, Jenny.Tom Hanks gave an incredible performance as Forrest, a man of 75 IQ who is waiting at a bus stop whilst telling his life story. As we see the story develop from him meeting both his sweetheart Jenny, Elvis Presley and being told 'run Forrest, run!' different people arrive at the bus stop and listen to him. Each meets his story with emotions ranging from enraptured to derision, as they learn with the audience the incredible life Forrest has led. This includes him starring in the All American Football team, winning a Congressional Medal of Honour in Vietnam, exposing the Watergate scandal and making millions from 'Bubba-Gump shrimping industries', while meeting three different U.S Presidents along the way. The film ends on a poignant note, with Jenny and Forrest meeting again and having a son, as Jenny dies of HIV/AIDS.Along with Tom Hanks in the title role Forrest Gump featured an excellent supporting cast, with career bests from Robin Wright Penn as Jenny and Gary Sinise as the legless Vietnam veteran Lt. Dan Taylor.I was inspired by the wonder of a man experiencing his life without realising its significance to the world, just simply wishing for an emotionally damaged woman who goes on to live a lonely life without him. She rejects Forrest, telling him 'he doesn't know what love is', before eventually realising that no-one would ever love her more.Due to its preposterous plot line and sentimental tone, Forrest Gump could easily have descended into melodramatic mush peppered with phony special effects. However in the capable hands of screenwriter Roth and director Zemeckis the movie becomes a highly entertaining yet profound account of one simple-minded man who goes on an enthralling quest. For such an audacious film there were amazingly few flaws (Forrest inspiring John Lennon to write the song 'Imagine' and the contrivances of him running across America the only examples I can recall).Forrest Gump is a film that may well transcend anything of its kind. It gave us a character I had great sympathy and hope for, and reminded me that a person needs no intelligence to be an upstanding and admirable person.9/10 BrianInvincible"
22416,True,There are some in which we cannot enjoy .There are some movies which aren't smart mix of comedy and drama.There is one Forrest Gump which changed whole structure of mixes .There is one Tom Hanks who definitely one of the best actor who transformed himself from dummy to smart man .There are so many laughs and so many dramatic scenes .There is one sad but funny story .There is story which learned us how one man can change the world with his running and he can call whole nation to run with him .There is one friendship with Bubba which ends with death and there is one love with Jenny .There is only one Forrest Gump and watch it .
22417,True,"As a low-IQ child escaping the pursuit of his classmates, a football player holding the ball considering nothing but to run, and a Vietnam War soldier saving his friends regardless of danger, Forrest Gump seemed to be running all the way in his life. He ran through not only his life, but also most of the most meaningful years of American history. We can never imagine that it is a person with only 75 IQ that could be interviewed by the President Kennedy and President Johnson, accidentally exposed the Watergate scandal of President Nixon, participated in the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and America, and even enlightened Elvis Presley with his casual dance. He shared his innocence and purity with people around him, even in the most difficult times, and also explained us what true love and friendship are. Finally, Forrest became a millionaire, a father, and an idol by his running-followers, any of which could be the dream of the normal people. He made us laugh at ourselves, because we finally realized that it is not your possessions that make you powerful, but your internal heart."
22418,True,"All I can say is that I love this movie! Tom Hanks is such a wonderful actor. The very beautiful Robin Wright was perfect for this part, she always loved Forrest, but just was never really in love with him, and ends up jumping around from guy to guy looking for love and drugs as a adolescent sexually abused flower child of the 1960's. Although Forest was born with a learning disorder, he goes on to accomplish great things, and meet some of histories most notable figures of the 1950's, 1960's and 1970's such as President John F. Kennedy, President Lyndon Johnson, President Richard Nixon, Governor George Wallace, before he is shot, leaders of the Black Panthers, Elvis Presley and Forrest even receives the Medal of Honor for selfishly saving the lives of his fellow platoon members during Vietnam war.After Forrest's return to civilian life, he goes on to start a shrimping company named the Bubba Gump shrimping company with his former Lt. Colonel, who thn wisely invests the companies profits in a small start up in Silicon Valley called Apple computer.Although Forrest accomplishes success in life, deep inside all he really wants is to marry Jenny, his child hood friend and first love, and have a family. The story takes an interesting twist when Jenny is diagnosed with a disease that we can only assume may be AIDS due to her care free and irresponsible drug use and numerous sexual partners over the years.Such a movie, although fictional inspires all us to strive to be good hearted and kind, in a child like manner as Forrest Gump is. This film is a modern day classic that you can watch over and over again.Jose F. Medeiros"
22419,True,"Everything about this film works! The acting. The visuals. The story. Everything is strewn together in a story of one's mans life and his journey to understand love, friendship, and destiny, leaving us with a film unlike any other that cannot be imitated.Tom Hanks's performance as the main character will be the one that defines his career. He makes his character believable yet different from any other movie character ever created. Watching him grow up and learn more about the world is already well done, but what is amazing is that even though his world changes around him, he does not. As a result, he learns more about life, love, destiny, and how they all work together.Gary Sinise's character, Lt. Dan, is one of my favorites in this movie. Just like Forrest, he learns about destiny and life. But unlike Forrest, he already had his own belief about destiny, and how he was destined to be a certain thing. But life got in the way, and he felt ""cheated"" out of his destiny growing depressed and alcoholic. It is not until a life-threatening situation that he comes at peace with his life and the fact that it took a road different from his destiny.The way that director Robert Zemeckis uses both human emotion and creative special effects to tell such a story is ingenious. Everything flows together, creating an unforgettable story that faces issues like destiny and fate, American society and history, and love and friendship. Add that to great performances, especially from Hanks and Sinise, and what comes out is a great story that will be around and highly admired for years to come. 10 out of 10!"
22420,True,"''Forrest Gump'' is a very beautiful movie that totally deserves to be in the top 250 from the IMDb, receiving nothing less then six Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor. The story is a lesson of life, showing the simple and mentally challenged Forrest in an epic journey through life, meeting historical figures like Elvis,John F. Kennedy,Richard Nixon, Jonh Lennon, among many others and experiencing first-hand historic events, while largely unaware of their significance, due to his low IQ of 75.Even misunderstood by many people and considered to be ''stupid'' by them, Forrest has more success in his life then many of his ''normal'' friends, receiving many honor medals, becoming rich and inspiring many people. The movie is a lesson of life and shows how people who are discriminated can have more success then many of the ordinary ones.And Lt. Dan Taylor, shows how people's minds can change through the years, when he first wants to die in the camp with his soldiers, and years later, thanks Forrest, that saved his life from the death.I think everybody should watch this awesome movie at least once in a lifetime."
22421,True,"Cast: Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Robin Wright, Mykelti Williamson, Sally Field Director: Robert Zemeckis***This may contain spoilers***This is the most inspirational movie I have ever seen. Starring Tom Hanks, it is a story about the life of man named Forrest Gump who experiences many things. His experiences take place at a time when the world is constantly changing, and there is no telling where Forrest will end up next. Throughout his life's journey, he learns many lessons from all kinds of people. Forrest meets some of the most well known public figures of his time. Some include Elvis Presley, John Lennon, John F. Kennedy, and Richard Nixon. The movie starts off when Forrest is a young boy with braces on his legs. Bullies would pick on him everyday chasing him home until one day his braces started falling apart while he was running. When parts began to fly from his legs, he realized he was running and was overcome with joy. This was his turning point when he was a boy. He grew up like a normal person would and graduated high school. After that a football coach noticed his talents as a football player and Forrest received a scholarship to play college football. Around the time he graduated, the Vietnam war was happening. He was drafted and sent to Vietnam. He meets Bubba who was his best friend and he also meets another great friend named Lt. Dan. Forrest was shot in the war and while he recovered he played ping pong. After his time served in the military, he continued to play ping pong for the United States and made a lot of money. With this money he bought him a shrimp boat and became a shrimp boat captain. Lt. Dan became his first mate and they started shrimping. One day Forrest headed back home on news that his mother was very ill. He stayed with her until she passed away. To deal with the sorrow from his mother passing, he began to run across the country. He would only stop to eat and sleep and would run coast to coast until one day he stopped running. He then returned home and lived there for a while. Then one day he received a letter from Jennie and went to see her. When he got there she told him that she was sick and that he had a son named Forrest. They then moved back to Forrest's house and lived there until Jennie passed. Forrest then raised his son. Forrest meets the love of his life when he was a boy and her name was Jennie. The love he has for her is what keeps Forrest going through life and takes him to all of the wonderful places he goes. She was a sweet girl who was Forrest's best friend. She was the one who told him to just run if something bad was happening. Her advice led to his braces coming off, his survival, and his freedom from people. She was Forrest's number one fan. No matter where she was or what she was doing she would help him if he needed it. As she grew up many things changed about her life, and she wasn't the best person. She moved off to college and got kicked out. Then she moved off and left Forrest to travel with some hippies, got addicted to drugs, but eventually she turned her life around to become a good person. Tom Hanks' acting was superb. He played the role of an innocent, simple man who was in large events. The simplicity he brings to the role makes you think that Forrest is an actual person. The acting is delivered well and isn't swinging between different personalities. There wasn't a flaw in Tom Hanks' performance. Gary Sinise, who played Lt. Dan, was great in his role. He pulled off the crazy but intelligent leader that he was. For the little time that Mykelti Williamson played Bubba in the movie, you felt connected as if he was your best friend. Robin Wright played Jennie perfectly, portraying Jennie as an opposite to Forrest. Lastly, Sally Field played Forrest's mother perfectly. She was caring, informative, and helpful like a mother should be. All in all Forrest Gump is an inspirational movie about a simple man who lived an extraordinary life. It is full of life lessons and proves that anybody can do anything."
22422,True,"I have a half brother who grew up in the Southern U.S. and on one occasion we were discussing this film and he said he felt it portrayed Southerners as dimwitted. I disagreed with him and informed him that the author himself was a native Southerner. The setting is central to this story in that it lets the tale unfold tying in factual events with the fable before us.The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels. From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation. Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend, he moves you with his character. Words don't grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys' tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright."
22423,True,"This is a lovely comedy-drama story where the main actor has a different perspective on life since he has a minor mental disability and the way he faces life challenges is special. Their main characters (Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Dary Sinise and Sally Field) take you into this heart-warming- love-story whose plot is always changing due to the particular attitude of the main character who lives in Alabama and who plays many roles without any prejudice(gardener, baseball player, runner, ping-pong player, soldier, entrepreneur, etc..) he just get carried away by the circumstances and do every single thing simple and easy. Based on a novel written by Winston Groom and directed by Robert Zemeckis. I would really recommend this charming film that will move your inner emotions and leave you a great message ""Live without complications""."
22424,True,", Forrest Gump is the kind of guy that would take off his coat for a stranger if they were cold. The kind of person who forgives over and over and doesn't really want much in return besides friendship. He's not the smartest tool in the shed, but his love and compassion for the ones in his life go beyond what most normal people are capable of. Everyone knows he's basically the nerdy (but witty) underdog, and he is always teased or asked if he's stupid, to which he normally replies ""stupid is as stupid does"". He joins the army after he graduates college and meets his best good friend Bubba on the bus (a black man who is very similar in character to Forrest, and who immediately clicks with him). Bubba tells Forrest about the shrimping business, which has run in his family for at least 2 generations. They make a deal to form a ""shrimping"" team after they return home and split all the money 50-50. *SPOILER ALERT**DO NOT KEEP SCROLLING IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE Not very long after Bubba and Gump make their pact, Bubba gets wounded in battle, as does their Lieutenant, Dan...and a couple other characters. Dan wants Forrest to leave him to get killed in battle (by bombs) because he lost his legs and he wanted to die with honor, but Forrest picked him up despite Dan's orders, and tries to save both him and Bubba, but after Bubba is carried by Forrest (also against Dan's orders), he is gasping for air and dies in Forrest's arms. I think this is one of the most important parts of the movie, because it shows not only how humble Mr. Gump is towards his friends, but his sheer backbone and determination to do the right thing. Thank you for reading"
22425,True,"Tom Hanks proves he is America's actor as really he is such a great and awesome actor and plays the everyman of the world like it is really a real person and not the actor.Forrest Gump is a not too bright man but really has great intentions and a heart of gold. And only wants to be a part of his one and only friend's Jenny's life played by Robin Wright.As unintentionally he becomes part of the greatest historic events like Watergate, civil rights issues, the Vietnam War, and ping pong champion as he in the war, meets his mentor and soon to be friend, Lt Dan played by Gary Sinise.He remains his true humble self along with only his heart of gold and simple yet lovable self.Really a great film with acting, directing, and heart of soul and gold. As we don't get much films these days. Way to go Tom and the other actors!"
22426,True,"Tom Hanks has proved over the years that he is a talented and versatile actor and his performance as Forrest Gump is easily one of his best (only his performance in Philadelphia was better in my opinion from his films I've seen).But it's not only Hanks performance that makes this film remarkable, but the story itself. Forrest Gump is an unintelligent man, but he has a heart of gold. We get to learn about his life story and everything from childhood, his college years to his service in the army in Vietnam to his eventual marriage to Jenny. We get to see Gump's struggles through life as he is picked on for being unintelligent and we also get to see some happy moments in the 2 strong friendships Gump forms with one of his army buddies (Bubba) in Vietnam and his childhood friend and eventually his wife Jenny.What is also great about Forrest Gump? The fact that we are presented with a central character who we can sympathise with. It is all too easy sometimes for film makers and their writers to create characters who we are supposed to care about, but we start out hating, and hate them throughout the film and then hate them at the end. This is not the case with the character of 'Forrest Gump' It is impossible not to like Forrest as he shows that although he isn't bright, he is still capable of showing his emotions and empathy towards others i.e his protectiveness for Jenny, and when he rescues most of his platoon in Vietnam. Whilst Forrest Gump is a serious film, it does have many funny moments like when Jenny tells Forrest Gump that she has a son called Forrest and that she named him after his dad and Forrest Gump turns round and says 'He's got a daddy called Forrest too'. Obviously she then tells him that Forrest is his son.Is this film perfect? Not quite - Forrest Gump's continual running seemed pointless to me, although it was fun to watch.Forrest Gump is a wonderful film with a basic story about the life of a truly remarkable person and is well worth your time."
22427,True,"I seen this movie in the theater when it first came out. My mother, grandmother, great grandmother, and my two older brothers were all together. I have loved this movie since I first saw it. His longing to be loved by Jenni and the adventures the longing took him on are priceless. Just some regular guy having his foot in all these important moments in U.S. history. On a lonely day or when I need to put things in perspective and get a laugh, I pop this one in. I laugh, I cry, I think, I relax, I wonder and then I cry again at the end. I definitely like his mother and Jenni dying in the movie. It is very realistic that way. Watching Forrest sit on the stump waiting for little Forrest to come back and the feather taking off is a memorable moment for me. He lost important people in his life and gained something so priceless on the way. Jenni was gone but yet he still had a part of her, the best part. Life goes on and you take the bad with the good. I also learned life won't happen for you if you sit on the couch all day feeling sorry for yourself."
22428,True,this is the best movie i've ever seen. no movie has ever touched me like this one. tom hank's acting was just so great. this is the kind of movie people will love forever. the thing is if you can't feel this movie then you won't like it very much. once you love this movie you can never ever forget it. it's so unique and wonderful. just a brilliant masterpiece. i'm really lucky that i watched this movie. such a romantic movie. i really don't understand how on earth some people can't like it. it's ridiculous. the rating 8.7 on IMDb is really low. it shouldn't be less than 9.0 at all. i strongly recommend that if you haven't watched it then you must watch it
22429,True,"Three of the greatest films of all time came out in 1994: The Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump. Each were absolute masterpieces and I thoroughly enjoyed each of these movies. 'Forrest Gump' is one of the better drama films I've ever seen. The casting for this film was brilliant, as was the directing and writing. The script was brilliant and the acting was phenomenal, especially by Tom Hanks. This film, is very similar to 'Edward Scissorhands' in many ways and are the two greatest romance films I've ever seen. What I found interesting about this film is how everything is narrated by Tom Hanks' character, Forrest Gump, whilst sitting at a bus stop and telling his life story to other people. The fact that the end tells us that Forrest is waiting to catch a bus to meet Jenny, the love of his life, after all these years was great. The scenes where we realize that Jenny has a kid named Forrest Jr. and that he is the father was nicely done. When Jenny died, you can feel the emotion and feel such pity for Forrest as the chemistry between the two was good, the music was very quiet and most importantly, they were characters we felt connected to. The other two great chemistries were between Lieutenant Dan and Forrest as well as Buba and Forrest. The scene where Bubba dies was extremely sad as I would've loved to see him for longer. Pretty much a classic film!"
22430,True,"I do not mean to sound like a 'fanboy', but this film was simply amazing. It is one of the rare films in the modern age to teach the audience a lesson, a moral even - pure good deeds, and a kind heart are always welcomed within society.Tom Hanks played Forrest extremely well. Even in the first scene where we see him sitting on a bench, without dialogue we can tell that this character is mentally challenged. He barely even uses body language. Hanks plays Forest extremely well through all the different stages off his later life. Forest is just a nice character, not wanting to hurt anyone or anything. A real heart-warming character.This film has been beautifully directed by Robert Zemeckis. I am a fan of Zemeckis, he has directed other favourite films of mine such as the Back to the Future trilogy, Cast Away and The Polar Express, but this is his best work yet. The way he makes the audience feel the characters is very well done. Whilst watching this, I felt so many different feelings such as guilt, sadness and joy - which is what this film is all about. His work on Forrest Gump has been recognised, as he won Best Director at the Academy Awards, as well as five others. Whilst watching this film, I and I'm pretty sure everyone else who has seen it, felt the feelings of Forrest. From his school days getting bullied and his beloved Bubba dying in Vietnam, to receiving a Medal of Honour and becoming a millionaire. I cannot emphasise enough, that Tom Hanks played this role to perfection.I love the way the film is told through Forrest. He tells people at a bus stop the story of his life, and the people listening in really represent the audience, as they get drawn into the story and simply do not want it to end. I also like the way in which Zemeckis has included the white feather at the beginning and end of the film.As a whole, this film is brilliant, and I recommend it to absolutely anyone. It is so inspiring, and everyone can be like Forrest."
22431,True,"Forrest Gump was absolutely incredible. There are many reasons for this; the movie was acted elegantly being one of them. Also, the story line was rivetingly moving. Lastly, there are many quotes from the film that simply unforgettable. Those are the reasons why Forrest Gump is so incredible.First of all, Forrest Gump is such an amazing film because the acting made this movie so memorable for everyone who would watch it. Even though Tom Hanks has had many other amazing performances such as Woody from Toy Story, his role as Forrest is by far the most memorable in my opinion. Furthermore, Robin Wright does an incredible job as Jenny, who is Forrest's true love in the movie. The combination of these to stars was instantly recognized by many as a recipe for a film that would warm the hearts of many for decades to come. That is why the acting in Forrest Gump helps to make this motion picture so amazing.Secondly, a reason that I feel makes this movie so incredible is that I have never seen a movie that has had a story line that is so moving. There are so many events that happen in this movie that make me want to cry because they make you feel so good inside that these things have happened. For instance, When Forrest meets up with Jenny fret not seeing her for a few years and meets his son was incredible. He asks Jenny as his son gets on the bus, ""Is he smart?"" Jenny responds with, ""He's the smartest in his class."" This scene is without a doubt the most moving scene that I have ever seen in a movie, ever. That is why I feel that the story line of this movie is more riveting, heart-warming, and moving than any other movie out there.However, there are a couple elements in this movie that some people would view negatively about this masterfully created movie. Some events are completely preposterous, but they help make the movie's plot tremendously, and they make you appreciate reality more. For instance, there is no way that any human would be able to run across the country three times in a row only stopping to eat and use the restroom. However, this event makes the movie interesting and only makes you realize how far someone can go to overcome adversity.Finally, the last reason that I have that contribute to the masterpiece that is Forrest Gump is that some of the quotes that were made throughout the film are very memorable. One quote made by Forrest makes you really think about life; ""My momma always said, 'Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.'"" This is possible the greatest movie quote of all time. Another quote, which was made by Mrs. Gump; ""You have to do the best with what God gave you."" This quote makes you realize that there are always going to be struggles in life, but you have to make the best out of everything that God puts upon you. That is how the quotes from Forrest Gump help make this movie one of the best films of all time.In conclusion, I challenge you, the reader, to watch the masterpiece Forrest Gump and look out for the choir group, ""The Hallelujah Singers."" This is a group led by Marleena Smalls of Beaufort, who played Bubba's mother in the movie. Also, watch for more memorable quotes, amazing performances by actors, and events that will move you an make you feel warm inside. Forrest Gump is truly one of the greatest films of all time, and it is both a memorable movies ever; this is because of all of the reasons that have been stated above."
22432,True,"""Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you might get."" This rings so true from this story of perseverance, survival and love. 'Forrest Gump' is such a beloved classic drama from the 1990s starring Tom Hanks as the title character (he won the Best Actor Oscar that year for this film), a simple man from Alabama who experienced many life-changing events from the Vietnam War in which he served to the end of his beloved's life from an unknown virus (she is played by Robin Wright(she no longer has Penn attached these days)). This film touches the heart of any viewer as he or she watches how the world changes in the eyes of this simple country man with an IQ of 70. This is an ingenious story that will make you want to watch this over and over again."
22433,True,"This movie is phenomenal! It's amazing and once you see it, you will want to watch it over and over again! It's truly a breath-taking film where Forrest teaches Elvis Presley to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam and meets one of the greatest friends on Earth named Bubba, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Hippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years. Also, never to forget his one true love Jenny. It is a romantic comedy for all ages to enjoy and learn about events in our past and many more things. Ignore others bad reviews and see it for yourself! Then voice your opinion because others might have different reviews on this movie. Overall, I loved it so much that I got some of his sayings in my head, ""Stupid is as stupid does"" and ""Life is like a box of chocolates you never know what your going to get""! Favorite movie of all time! Go watch it! :)"
22434,True,"I find it very difficult to understand why people who call themselves film lovers can hate this film, while people are entitled to their opinion I truly believe some people find it hard not to over analyse films; my own sister is one of the haters!! This film is all that is innocent and morally good in everybody, not just Americans. Forrest Gump is not stupid he simply sees the good and the truth in all things, he goes out of his way to do the right thing no matter what the circumstance. This film is beautiful in every aspect, the casting is superb and the narrative itself is breathtaking and unbelievably moving. I love every aspect of this film and I do wish that people who do not like it sit down open their eyes and simply see the beauty within this film and if you still don't like it watch it again because I guarantee you will have missed something."
22435,True,"the year 1994 i thought i saw something special. pulp fiction came to my eyes, i thought wow. that is a film...then i saw shawshank redemption,a film that gives us everything based on hope, friendship and redemption,simple prison drama people thought. yet when they have watched it, it made them cry...i thought best film I've ever seen, no way will there be a film better than this. then i watched forest gump for the first time...simple little forest gump, no hopes for a future as it seemed as a youngster, how it states...hes spine is crooked as a politition, were gonna straighten it all out for him,, this film will give people with disadvanteges hope. an all star cast with the best performances of there lives.. Gary Sinise said, when he got the script he was puzzled, saying how will this work i don't get it. when he learnt he's lines he burst into tears wondering how he has been involved with such beauty.. Oscar went to the right film. we will never see a line up for best picture again like that ever..thank you for this work of art.. because if heaven was in a movie, this was it."
22436,True,"ATTEMPTING TO WRITE a review for this film has proved to be a very difficult job; in fact, it is probably the toughest review that we have encountered over this past decade. Producing a write-up is generally on one's overall like or dislike of the Film in question. Consequentally, our better efforts are rated higher than others for that very reason. Passionate prose requires a rationing of fist class, 'Grade A' fuel; strictly High Octane.THAT WE HAVE no really strong opinion about the worth of this now classic, Oscar laden favourite, leaves us with what we fear will turn out to be a figurative stalemate, a split decision, a statistical draw. And we are reminded of former Notre Dame Football Coach Frank Leahy, whose eloquence in surmising what it is like to neither come out a victor, nor failing in the attempt to secure a win.TO BEGIN WITH, the screenplay offers the telling of the story in flashback. The occurrences of what is nearly a life's worth of really unusual happenings and very unlikely coincidences, all seem to have been mixed into an emulsion of what can only be described as some of the most important moments in American and, indeed, World History.WHILE FULLY REALIZING that a Film, no matter how good it may be, is still just a movie, escapist entertainment. It is a powerful form of fictional day dreaming; but still it's make believe, nonetheless.WE ARE REQUIRED to be entertained by the incessant recitation of the narrative of all of these events that have led up to Forrest Gumps reunion with his life long friend and one true Love, Jennie. The long, deliberate cadence of Gump's delivery of this dialog is found to be very amusing, even to the most sour pussed stoic in the audience.SORRY FOR HAVING to throw cold water on our ongoing involvement in this mirth-fest but we really out to pause and give some serious and sober analysis to this, our cause of amusement.WHEN ASKED IN AN interview* about how and why LI'L ABNER creator, Al Capp, chose to build his comic strip around Hillbilly characte5rs in a most rural setting of Dogpatch, USA; his answer was delivered, quickly and in a most straight manner. Al stated that the use of Hillbilly characters was a nearly sure fire prescription for success. His reasoning being that the introduction of Hillbilly characters makes the job of succeeding in creating the desired yuk-yuks easier because everyone feels that they are superior to these American Rustics.WE MUST ALSO consider the characterization of Forrest as being not just uncouth or ill mannered; but rather that he is truly slow or mentally deficient. He most certainly must suffer from some acute degree of mental retardation. Is this what the pseudo intellectuals in the Elite of Tinsel Town believe to be the polite and proper cause for merriment and mirth? WE ALSO DETECT at least a smattering of snobbishness and sanctimony. This is amplified by an unabashed utilization of patronizing preachiness, which would seam to reassure the production team's moral and intellectual superiority; at least to their way of thinking, we suppose.NOTE: * This interview was done 1n the 1960's and published in a certain quasi-intellectual Men's Magazine; which also did a good business in peddling the exposition of feminine pulchritude and skin. Of course, Schultz and I only bought it for the articles. Honest!"
22437,True,"Forrest Gump is perhaps one of the greatest films of all time if not the very best. I feel like Forrest Gump almost all of the time.Forrest Gump is a film that everyone must see before they die. It is so touching. It just has an excellent mix of sadness, happiness, comedy, and just about everything I could ask for in a film. Some people do not even realize how great this film is. It is generally liked by the people and critics but it still does not have the credit that it deserves.Tom Hanks played the role of Forrest Gump perfectly. I could not see anyone else in the role. Speaking of acting, every actor and actress delivered amazing performances. All of the acting was great.""Forrest Gump"" will always be a favorite of mine and I recommend it to anyone who has not seen it."
22438,True,"Tom Hanks stars in his Oscar winning role in the best picture winning instant classic, Forrest Gump. When making Forrest Gump, it seems like director Robert Zemeckis' only goal is for this film to be a classic. And it truly is.Forrest Gump is the story of a guy named Forrest(obviously played brilliantly by Tom Hanks), a guy who has an I.Q. of 75. Forrest, throughout the entire film, is telling his life story. And his experiences. From his love for Jenny(played by Robin Wright Penn), who eventually becomes a hippie slut, to his days in the war, from his encounter with Elvis, and it goes on.Tom Hanks' performance is so delightfully sweet. and so is the movie. Forrest Gump is delightfully funny, blissfully sad, and downright sweet and a ton of fun. My momma doesn't like this movie. I don't know why. I may never understand it.When I think about it, I don't think it deserved best movie of the year over Pulp fiction and The Shawshank Redemption. But sometimes I do think that it did. Forrest is such a lovable character. And he has such an exiting life.The ending is sad, the film is a little sentimental, but it's not a problem, the acting is terrific. Especially from Tom Hanks and Gary Senise as the lovable Lieutenant Dan. Forrest Gump is a delightful film. One of the best pictures of 94. Not positive if it's the best, but it makes the top three no doubt.Forrest Gump: A+"
22439,True,"Do not buy this on Blu-ray, the conversion or whatever is really , really , bad.Paramount has put this movie out as a blu-ray, but I'm pretty sure it's only upscaled DVD, with 540i or more likely 540p :-( this is one of my top movies of all time as the titles says, but i was expecting the full 1080i which my 47"" Philips supports (thank you Lord Jesus).stoopid is as stoopid does, cmon Paramount, you make one of the best movies ever and hit us with this rubbish??? Forrest was simple but never acted stupid, so why you?peaceDavaParamount you owe me a tenner, 'cos i could of got FG at a lower price, so invest that tenner in proper 1080i please. 10 out of 10 for the movie! 1 out of 10 for the upscaled video fudge as blu-ray!"
22440,True,"What an amazing movie! This is how movies should be made. I saw this 3 times now and a few minutes ago, and I said to myself that I had to comment on this one, and as a matter of fact I rarely come here to comment as this is my 5th comment. With every view of this movie it always gets betterI find this movie very beautiful, thoughtful, funny and in the end all that matters is how much it touches you. Well this movie had done all that. I'll have to say that Tom Hanks deliveres one of the best acting performances ever and as that said my favorite. So the movie let's you know in the beginning that Forrest is a little slow as his momma said, but as we discover he can do some amazing things no matter of his problems. No matter where he was he was always thinking about the ones who loved, even for someone he knew for a little while, he always saw the good parts of people. In the end we learn that he is not the ill or the problematic one but that everyone around him were that. He was always enjoying the little things, a thing that we all don't do very often. The thing that touched me a lot and thought that was just amazing about Forrest is that he helped everybody in a way even that he didn't knew. Everybody found happiness in the end and I like to think that Forrest's being push them.I give this one none less then a perfect 10 and I think that everybody should see this at least once to see how beautiful things are through Forrest Gump's eyes""That's all I have to say about that"""
22441,True,"On the very rare occasion that I give a movie a ten I always feel the need to add a little line about how no movie is perfect. Sometimes I slap that ten with a qualifier and leave it at that.I probably should have done that with Forrest Gump. Tom Hanks is an acting legend that had never truly failed, but he took this character to a place I don't think any other actor could have. He was absolutely fantastic and he had a script to work with here that allowed him to shine like never before.As I was watching this movie I knew, even as young as I was, that the performance was Academy Award winning good. I was so moved by the performance that I actually predicted Tom Hanks would win before the movie was half over. When the nominations were announced I predicted that Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Writer would all go to this movie (I never even thought about direction at that time and knew nothing about screenplays and all that) This movie is a classic and everyone should experience the laughter, sorrow, and inspiration it will almost certainly solicit in most viewers.So wish I would have given it a ten."
22442,True,"Short review but, this movie was great and it really gets you thinking about death, and how beautiful life is, i feel like this movie turned a lot of things around for me. now i feel like i should love my life even more than before (that rhymed). the movie is funny and keeps you entertained while still learning you some life lessons."
22443,True,"love this film and the film is like a box of chocolates never know what your gonna get i laughed all the way through i highly recommend watching this film. no nudity, no bad violence suitable for all the family even know it was released a while ago i will be introducing my kids to this film"
22444,True,"When it comes to the greatest dramatic films ever produced, ""Forrest Gump"" has to be near the top of that list. Put succinctly, it has everything a movie could possible hold: adventure, great characters, drama, emotion, and humor. There are very few films that combine all those things with such aplomb as director Robert Zemeckis does with ""Gump"".For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the life story of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a man who, on the ""scale of normal"", falls a wee bit short in the intelligence department. However, via the guidance of his beloved Mama (Sally Field), the constant wanting for childhood sweetheart- turned-wild child Jenny (Robin Wright), and friends like Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) and Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), viewers are shown a life that, despite coming from such a simple man, has touched so many others.There are two primary reasons why ""Forrest Gump"" will resonate through the ages:First, is the Gump character himself. Not only did it rocket Tom Hanks to super stardom, but it is one of the greatest representations of life ever put on the big screen. Even though Forrest is obviously ""slow"", he has qualities about him that we all wish we could mimic. He doesn't get caught up in the ""b.s."" of life, instead just taking things at face value and living life in the moment. As a result, he has a knack for showing up at the right place at the right time. Sometimes, we get so caught up in the minutiae of our everyday lives that we forget to just ""live""...something Forrest does like no other.Secondly, this movie is a reflection of its times. I think there are so many baby boomers who, like Jenny, thought that counter-culture (drugs, hippies, etc.) was the best route into adulthood. What many of them realized, however, was that such behavior could not last forever, and eventually you have to come back to reality. In this case, Jenny has a Forrest to come back to, which provides the primary drama of the film.Overall, ""Forrest Gump"" is a landmark effort in cinema, as it is one of the only movies that can still hold up perfectly despite being only about ""the journey"", so to speak. It can be watched by viewers of pretty much all ages and enjoyed on some level. The film is on television so much these days that sometimes it gets a little over-exposed, but it still remains a special piece of filmmaking."
22445,True,"I absolutely love this movie! The acting, the cinematography, the writing, everything is perfect! I've seen this movie over a dozen times and every time I laugh and I cry. Tom Hanks, as always, does wonderfully at fully creating a character that you fall in love with. You follow Forrest on his adventures, which could seem a bit random, but due to his amazing acting paired with a great script, it all flows together and creates a film that leaves everyone in awe. I would recommend this movie to anyone, it truly has something for everyone."
22446,True,"""Like a box of chocolates, you'll never know what you're going to get"". Like a box of chocolates, in the film, Forrest Gump, you never know what you're going to get. Directed by Robert Zemeckis in 1994, the Academy Award winning Best Picture, Forrest Gump, follows the life of main character Forrest Gump through some of his most important life events. Played brilliantly by actor Tom Hanks, audience members empathize for Forrest as they watch him overcome tremendous hardships as a handicap, growing from a mentally unstable little boy to a successful war veteran and business owner. Through heartbreak, triumph, and loss, so many elements of emotion can be felt through the movie. Also, with the events of Forrest's life very much paralleling with America's history, historical moments of our country's past can be reminisced through the film. The film's main story line with regards to American history, with the variety of elements such as comedy, drama, and romance woven together in the plot, all brought out through Tom Hanks exceptional acting, makes the movie Forrest Gump, one of the most iconic of all time.Forrest Gump's plot not only follows the story of Forrest's life, but gives a glimpse at various historical moments of America. One of the many historically significant scenes includes the The Hippie Movement and their anti-war protests, as well as the Black Panther Party, which Forrest's long time lover, Jenny, was a part of. The movie also displays what some may say is the most ""accurate depiction of the Vietnam War"", as Forrest, for most of his life was a veteran of the war. The Vietnam War is one of the most controversial armed conflicts to ever take place in the 20th century, and during the movie, viewers experience a realistic depiction of the ""desultory"", ""purposelessness"" of it. The historical significance that the movie encapsulates is important as it provides viewers a glimpse into the history of America through a first person point of view.The roller-coaster of emotions that are felt in the movie by various elements including comedy, drama, and romance, makes Forrest Gump an enthralling film to see. The first time I watched the film, in the beginning, I thought that the movie was just a comedy, something that would make me chuckle here and there. Little did I know that the movie contained so many lessons and morals that hit me on a deeper level. I say that the film is like a chocolate molten cake, which from the outside has the appearance of a normal, one flavored, typical sponge cake. However, delving deeper into the cake, breaking the outside, chocolate oozes out, similar to what's really under the surface of the movie, Forrest Gump. I feel like many expect the movie to just be a comedic one, but really there is so much more than that. There is romance, drama, and heartbreak, all encapsulated in one two hour span of a film. The movie's twists and turns and the various life events of Forrest are so unexpected that I found myself crying one minute and laughing hysterically the second after. You can experience so many emotions in just this one film.Without Tom Hanks' brilliant acting as Forrest Gump, the movie's inspiring story line and captivating emotional elements would not have been exhibited at its greatest potential. What was most exceptional about Hanks' acting was his ability to naturally and accurately display a slightly disabled man, a very hard task for any actor to do. There is a fine line between overly exaggerating the role of a handicap person and slipping out of the true character of one, and in my opinion, Tom Hanks perfectly maintained his character throughout the entire film. In 1995, a year after the film was released, Tom Hanks won the Academy Award for Best Actor, Golden Globe for Best Actor, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor, and many other titles. Tom Hank's was and still is admired for his performance as Forrest, which was a tricky role to play, yet a powerful one that made the film so iconic.Without the deep rooted American culture and various elements evoking different emotions in the plot of the film, as well as Tom Hank's brilliant acting, Forrest Gump would not be the iconic movie that it is. Released in 1994, still today in 2017, Forrest Gump holds its magic and makes for one of the most iconic movies in history. Silly, heartwarming, and inspiring, Forrest Gump is an American classic that everyone should get the chance to watch."
22447,True,"This awesome movie is about an innocent man who represents how the world should be: he's loyal, humble, honest, he would never cheat or lie. He does everything with good heart and reaches success at the most important tasks of life.Only in America he could live such an interesting life: meet Elvis Presley, President Kennedy, John Lennon... He goes to Vietnam's war and he does everything following his heart. He becomes an American hero.Gary Sinise is a great American actor in his best performance too. He served in Vietnam with Forrest and was also a hero, protecting his men and fighting for his country."
22448,True,"Another tremendous movie by Tom Hanks. Throughout the movie Hanks shows amazing acting and gives a brief history of the past century of American culture and life. A great movie to show the family, a few ""cover-the- eyes"" moments for the children. Other than that it is another wonderful, high-quality American movie."
22449,True,"This awesome movie is about an innocent man who represents how the world should be: he's loyal, humble, honest, he would never cheat or lie.

He served in Vietnam with Forrest and was also a hero, protecting his men and fighting for his country.All in all this is a must-see movie for everyone, specially for non- Americans, so we can enjoy American culture and icons, as well as learn some American history, which is very useful."
22450,True,"Maybe the book was better.I get that they were going for a ""stupid is as stupid does"", to show the triumph of optimism, et al.But mostly this movie just made me sad. Sad that Forrest was treated this way. Sad that even his triumphs were accidental.The fact that they had Forrest get to meet Elvis, the president(s), John Lennon and all those other historical figures just made it seem even more fake than the CGI it took to add him to all those historical scenes (George Wallace, JFK, Johnson, etc.) It threw you out of the realism of the film -- AND also seemed so unrealistic that someone like Forrest could achieve those kinds of things outside of a film.Finally, I don't understand anyone considering his love of Jenny as a true romance. Yes, I believe he loved her. I believe that she loved him in her own way, but not romantically. I understand that she was incredibly messed up by the sexual abuse of her father and that's why she pursued the self-destructive life she did. I understand that she felt she might not be worthy of Forrest because she was suicidal and messed up. She seems to have tried to turn her life around right before she died of AIDS, and was trying to provide for herself without relying on a man.My interpretation of Jenny relationship with Forrest was either: 1. She came home because she was pregnant (cue her sleeping all the time), then had sex with Forrest, then years later when sick, claimed he was the father, so her son would be taken care of. or 2. Forrest truly was the father (and there are hints such as them bending their heads the same way while watching TV & fishing). If so, why did she not tell Forrest he had a child until she was dying? I understand maybe she didn't want to marry him and raise the child together - but that still seemed cruel. Again, I feel that she only married him at the end as she was dying to give the child a parent. Not because she felt true romantic love for Forrest.Best part of the film were the performances. I did like Gary Sinese's performance, that was outstanding. His bitterness at being rescued, his life trajectory and turn around were handled very well. Tom Hanks did a good job of portraying Forrest with dignity. And Robin Wright did a fairly good job as a self-destructive victim struggling to come to terms with her life."
22451,True,"The movie ""Forrest Gump"" sends some very important messages to its viewers, by using different themes, a special setting, an unusual plot, and an ""everyman"" characterization. I think this movie is amazing. It follows the life story of Forrest Gump. It is a modern classic, which will probably be famous always, and will always be applauded.This movie has a universal theme of acceptance and tolerance. Forrest repeats the phrase ""stupid is as stupid does"" many times in the film. It shows how people judge others on their academic intelligence, not on their emotional intelligence. Forrest has a very intuitive emotional intelligent, but he is judged by his academic intelligence, which is not very high. It presents to people how ""life is like a box of chocolates,"" and how you can choose what to do but you can't choose what you are and what your destiny is. The main character, Forrest Gump goes through many incidents in his life, which he doesn't choose. It also shows how Forrest is like a ""mockingbird"", bullied and judged unfairly because of his actions, appearance and understanding of things happening around him.The setting of this movie is special. It takes place in a small fictional town in Alabama, and in the wider world for 3 generations, from late 1950's threw to late 1980's. The film begins in Forrest Gump's hometown. Forrest is born with a low IQ of 70. He has polio and has to wear braces on his legs. He has troubles being accepted by a school and has a very difficult time fitting in. He meets a girl named Jenny. Jenny has a horrible childhood that involves a father that drinks and sexually abuses her. Forrest has a very strong feeling of wanting Jenny as a girlfriend and follows her through the whole film. He goes through many realistic incidents, but his response to them is surrealistic. One of those incidents was the Vietnam War, where he meets two new friends called Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) and Lt. Dane (Gary Sinise). He learns from both of them the meaning of friendship and commitment to one another. He also teaches them a couple of lessons; the real meaning of ""stupid is as stupid does"" and that everybody is equal and have feelings. Jenny appears in his life many times and leaves each time, mostly in the end; she leaves some ""foot steps"" after her. Those ""foot steps"" always lead him back to her and her influence on his life.Both the actors' casting and performance were very good. An American director named Robert Zemeckis directed the film. Tom Hanks, who plays the role of Forrest Gump, does a good job of talking in a southern accent although he is not a Southerner. His character is used in a surrealistic way. Tom Hanks narrates the movie. He talks as a first person narrative. The way he talks creates an unintelligent impression from the viewer's point of view. Sally Fields who plays Mrs.Gump, Forrest's mother symbolizes a good motherhood, determination and protection of human values. Jenny (Robin Wright) represents total acceptance; she is the first one to really accept Forrest as he is. She never judges him on his academic abilities.The movie sends its themes and messages in very unusual but interesting ways. It basically tells about the real and significant incidents through a long period of time. The movie definitely earned the 6 Academy awards that it received. It influenced so many people of many different ages in different ways. The script was very touching and the performances were amazing in presenting it. I think ""Forrest Gump"" is a film that everybody HAS to see."
22452,True,"It seems that most people either love ""Forrest Gump"" or hate it. I am right down the middle. I didn't find this movie to be a masterpiece, but I thought that it was interesting how they did it. The title character (Tom Hanks) is of course a retarded Alabaman who grows up with his single mother (Sally Field). Throughout the movie, he plays a part in almost every major event of the post-WWII era, and in the process meets several distinguished personalities. All the while, he continues trying to get back together with his sweetheart Jenny Curran (Robin Wright Penn). Toeing the line between comedy (he shows his butt to LBJ) and drama (his friend Bubba gets killed in Vietnam), the movie never gets idiotic, although it was intermittently sappy.Either way, I liked ""Forrest Gump"". It was the first Best Picture winner that I saw in the theaters, but I didn't consider it the best movie of 1994. In my opinion, that distinction goes to the under-appreciated ""Shawshank Redemption"".Tom Hanks sure has come a long way since his debut, the slasher flick ""He Knows You're Alone""."
22453,True,"Forrest Gump is an instant classic. It is easily lovable and has a brilliant script, along with a career best performance from Tom Hanks, great acting by the rest of the cast, a wonderful story and great direction. The story itself is told in such a witty manner, keeping in mind that the narrator is Tom Hanks and as he is a bit low on I.Q, he does not take his life very seriously and merrily spends it. The movie is long but it never drags on. I thought that even if it extended for a few more minutes, I would not mind it.Tom Hanks gives a splendid performance and is one character that would be remembered. The emotions are expressed through his eyes. It is very hard not to shed a few tears or even keep your eyes dry when he cries or is sad, especially during the death of his closest. Jenny's character is absolutely the opposite as she develops all wrong habits and suffers throughout her life. Not a very likable character. The other actors too give very good performances, mainly Sally Field, Garry Sinise. Bubba is also humorous with his obsession with shrimps.Everything is good about this movie. The movie doesn't get boring at all. One of the best movies I have seen. 10 on 10 for this film, which is rare since I don't give such rating usually."
22454,True,"Forrest Gump is a heart-breaking film of witt and startling grace. Another Oscar for Tom Hanks, who is unforgettable in his portrayal of Forrest Gump. He brings a touching gravity to the role of an idiot savant from the South who finds strength in God, country, his childhood pal, Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), and his great mother (Sally Field). When Forrest falls a few IQ points shy of minimal school requirements, his Mother knows who to sleep with to bend the rules. Her son has a gift. As Forrest makes his pilgrim's progress from the '50s to the '80s, he becomes a college football star, a Vietnam war hero, a world-class ping pong player, a shrimp tycoon and even a father.Forrest is everything we admire in the American character - honest, brave, loyal - and the film's fierce irony is that nobody can stick around him for long.""Forrest Gump"" is an entertaining film of extreme importance. It completely reiterates the idea that no one should be prejudiced for being different. What a superb example of film-making! 9/10"
22455,True,"I was shock with disbelief when I saw the top movie of that year was Forest Gump (1994) instead of Angels In The Outfield (1994) which was second from the bottom. It was as though society was sucking up to trash. I don't care who puts this movie up as something it is fact not worth watching, as most of it was boring, not very entertaining and certainly not funny. There's nothing interesting about a nerdy Peter Pan adult whose stupidity can easily be taken advantage of. I see nothing morally right about someone showing their bare buttocks. I got the impression that whoever came up with this concept really didn't have any good ideas and just slap this together to throw at the audience, just to make a buck. There's nothing worse than insulting the audience intelligence. The only drama in it is the unpredictability of what this wacko character would do while loose in the community. If running you through different scenes/locations is adventure, then that has certainly taken a back seat."
22456,True,"Forrest Gump is a good-natured simpleton. His below-average IQ has restricted him (some might say protected him) from understanding the intricacies of the world he inhabits, and so he is oblivious to the hate and prejudice of American society.Robert Zemeckis (Cast Away, Back To The Future) and multiple academy-award winner Tom Hanks (Philadelphia, Saving Private Ryan) present us with the world as seen through the eyes of Forrest Gump, in one of the most powerful stories ever committed to screen.Though he may not be the smartest person in the world, Forrest Gump has achieved some amazing things. Aside from meeting three different American presidents and becoming a world ping-pong champion, Forrest has also been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honour for his courage during the Vietnam War, run across the country several times over (because he ""just felt like running""), inspired Elvis Presley to invent a new type of dance and exposed the Watergate scandal. At the heart of the film is a love-story. Forrest and his life-long companion, Jenny (Robin Wright Penn- Hurlyburly, The Singing Detective), are two completely different people, and Jenny knows that he deserves better, but Forrest loves her anyway. ""I'm not a smart man,"" Forrest declares. ""But I know what love is.""The acting in this film is nothing short of perfect. Tom Hanks demonstrates how he will win his second Best Actor Oscar with this performance. Nobody else could have possibly portrayed Forrest so perfectly. The supporting cast is strong. Robin Wright Penn is good, and Gary Sinise gives the best performance of his career as Lieutenant Dan Taylor.""... Life is a box of chocolates,"" Forrest announces at the beginning of the film. ""You never know what you are going to get."" This film is exactly that. Through the eyes of Forrest Gump, you will laugh, and you will cry. This life's journey is one that you will never forget."
22457,True,"I just can't believe that this movie is rated so highly in the IMDb Top 250.I only just watched the film recently and I would't watch it again.I am definitely in the minority amongst people I know that have seen the movie.They all seem to love it.So why didn't I?I'll give my reasons.First off,it is too long and I almost gave up on it half way through.I have to say that I found Forrest Gump to be annoying as well.I know that he is supposed to be a bit slow,but getting hit in the 'ButtOCKS'(You know the way he says it!!!) and ""My name is Forrest Gump,they call me Forrest Gump"" had me turning down the volume.Let's not forget ""Life is like a box of chocolates"",on second thoughts,maybe we should forget about it.I have seen Tom Hanks' performance described as astounding in other reviews.He is OK,definitely not astounding.The best acting came from Gary Sinise and even then they sugar coated his character at the end.The major problem for me though was when he got it together with his lifelong girl friend.I couldn't believe how contrived this felt and the only reason it happened was to tug at the heart strings in a cynical way.She dies of course but she has given birth to Forrests' child.Boy oh boy,did they really want you to sob your heart out.It didn't work for me at all.I can feel emotional when watching a movie,'It's A Wonderful Life' gets me every time.But this type of clinical and unrealistic 'emotion' left me cold and bored.So this film is rated above 'Gladiator' is it?Not in a million years.'Forrest Gump' is often described as a heartwarming tale.Just watch it again to see how cold and manipulative it really is."
22458,True,"'Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get' The above statement set the scene for this film, in my opinion as, going into it i had no idea what to expect. Forrest Gump is essentially a true underdog story that flourishes at every turn, and while the concept behind it may be far-fetched, it still manages to be believable throughout.The film starts out with a young boy who's mother, despite the setbacks her child has, aims to give her child a normal life. It's the extents she goes through to help him achieve this that truly set the scene for me, if anything it's a story about love, and courage.Hanks truly delivered in his role as Forest Gump, and truly helped to deliver one of my all time favourite performances.9/10"
22459,True,"i have only to say that when i saw this movie i became an instant fan of tom hanks and Hollywood . many people say how shawshank didn't get a Oscar because of this movie i say after tom hanks performance , i saw only one more performance compatible than this and that is of Daniel day lewis 'there will be blood'.When I first saw this movie I didn't appreciate it like I do now. I think it may have been because I was so young when I first saw it. Just recently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. That life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. That we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there's no hope... I just love this movie. And anyone who hasn't seen it or who thinks that don't like it I seriously suggest seeing it or seeing it again. It truly is amazing..."
22460,True,"Inspiring work by ZemicksForest Gump is a masterpiece. Obviously Robert zemciks and Tom hanks make a Brilliant Duo. Tom hanks has given many blockbusters to Hollywoodbut Forrest Gump must be his Best Movie ever. This movie keeps my eyes wet all the 142 minutes no matter how many times I watch it. I can say that it is because of sheer emotions which this movie seems to be pulling out..The movie is all about a semi retarded kind of Boy with a low IQ at his best innocence level. Gump never grows up or matures in the movie. He never becomes a man and remains a boy throughout the movie. This movie focuses around lot of different aspects of life mainly showing that life isn't that bad but it's only us who think down the wrong way. This movie shows us that we should appreciate all the little things we get and not let the big sorrows and pain hold us back. Lot of VfX work is done in the movie showing Gump rubs elbows with many famous personalities over the last half of the century including Elvis Presley and Nixon, General Dan doesn't really lose his legs either---they are just erased and the background is then touched up by using computer graphics programs.Tom is too good in the movie along with all the supporting actors who have done a very good job. Zemicks sure knows how to get his job done. Jenny seems to be the girl gump loves the most but she been shown a selfish and out-tracked character, while his mother has been a encouraging and inspiring one creating contrast. The traditional male heroes that we have had are all dysfunctional in some respect or another and we are lost without heroes but here Gump is a new kind of a role- model; he's A Nice Boy and everyone knows they're hard to find. There are many sequences in the movie which are work of pure fiction but still seem to be amazing like Gump turns out to a millionaire, becomes a national Runner as well as Heritage.The only thing I can tell u is watch this movie over and over cause art works don't repeat themselves much over a century or two. If u don't have anything else then watch this movie a 100 times. Kudos to Hanks and Zemicks."
22461,True,"""Back to the Future"" trilogy director Robert Zemeckis surpassed himself in ways that he probably never imagined when he made ""Forrest Gump."" Clocking in at two hours and forty minutes, this PG-13 rated comedy about the epic misadventures of a slow-witted dolt from rural Alabama with a below-average I.Q. who lives through several milestone events in the 1960s received the Oscar for Best Picture of 1994. Not only did Zemeckis earn a Best Director Oscar, but also Tom Hanks' took home the Academy statuette for Best Actor with his insightful, down-to-earth thesping. Forrest Gump is not the brightest bulb in the grid, but Hanks conveys this quality without ever stooping to histrionics. Above all, Hanks delivers a performance that has innocence and dignity intertwined. Moreover, ""Forrest Gump"" qualifies as Hanks' best film.""Forrest Gump"" unfolds in Savannah, Georgia, as the eponymous character narrates the story of his life in a number of flashbacks. Indeed, two-thirds of the action takes place with Forrest on the bench relating his exploits to other people waiting for their bus. The first time that we see young Forrest, he has just been fitted with a pair of leg braces at the doctor's office while his mother (Sally Fields of ""Norma Ray"") watches. She is determined to see to it that father-less Forrest gets to live as normal a life as possible. The school principal (Sam Anderson of ""La Bamba"") fails to convince her that Forrest's low I.Q. of 75 means that he should not attend regular school classes. Despite Forrest's intellectual's shortcomings, Mrs. Gump persuades the principal to permit Forrest to enroll in normal classes by having loud, noisy sex with him. The next time that we see young Forrest (newcomer Michael Humphreys) he hesitates about climbing aboard the school bus because he doesn't know the bus driver and has been warned by his mother not to accept rides from strangers. The driver and Forrest introduce themselves to each other and he steps aboard because they are now no longer strangers. Forrest meets his first best friend Jenny Curran when she is the only student riding the bus who will let him sit beside her. Later, Forrest meets his second best friend on his way to military boot camp when Bubba makes room for him to sit beside him after others have turned him away.Jenny and Forrest cultivate their friendship to the point that other students decide to attack Forrest. Initially, these obnoxious kids throw rocks at Forrest while he is walking home with Jenny. ""Run, Forrest, run,"" screams Jenny to our hero as the kids hurl more rocks and pursue him on their bicycles. Forrest takes off running and his braces disintegrate and he breaks into a loping stride that the kids on their bikes cannot match. The first chronological transition from young Forrest to Tom Hanks as Forrest occurs when the same kidsonly olderattack Forrest and Jenny (Robin Wright of ""The Princess Bride"") and try to run him down in their pick-up truck. Again, Forrest outruns them and scrambles through a practice scrimmage that Alabama football coach Bear Bryant (Sonny Shroyer of ""Gator"") is holding. Forrest winds up in college, joins the football and scores touchdowns for the Alabama Crimson Tide. During his stay at Alabama, Forrest is exposed to the famous stance in the doorway by real-life Alabama governor George Wallace when the University of Alabama was integrated by African-American students. As one of the black students is entering the school, she drops a book and Forrest retrieves it on camera. Later, Forrest visits the White House, drinks 15 Dr. Pepper sodas, and gets to shake hands with the real President John F. Kennedy.Meanwhile, Jenny has grown up, left her abusive father to live with another person, and ends up in an all-girls' school. Forrest shows up and beats up Jenny's date because he thinks that the guy is getting rough with her. Jenny gives Forrest his first sexual experience. She cups his hand over her breast and he blows a gasket while Jenny's roommateapparently asleeplistens in horror as Forrest admits that he has messed up the roommate's bathrobe. Jenny informs Forrest that she wants to become a folk singer like her idol Joan Baez. Forrest joins the U.S. Army and takes a furlough to Memphis, Tennessee, to see Jenny perform folk songs on stage. Forrest knows that Jenny got expelled from her college for posing nude in a 'Girls of the South' issue of Playboy magazine, but he isn't prepared for what he sees when she performs in the nude singing a Bob Dylan song. When a spectator heckles Jenny, Forrest comes to her rescue.Significantly, the film pioneered some revolutionary techniques, such as inserting a live actor into historic archival footage of important events as well as enabling Oscar nominated actor Gary Sinise to appear convincing as a handicapped Vietnam veteran who has lost both legs in combat. If the structure of ""Forrest Gump"" is reminiscent of David Fincher's recent opus ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"" this is no surprise because Eric Roth penned scripts for both ""Forrest Gump"" as well as ""Benjamin Button."" Roth got an Oscar for his adaptation of Winston Groom's novel. Not surprisingly, ""Forrest Gump"" was awarded Oscars for best visual effects. Interestingly, Paramount Pictures produced this film for $55-million dollars and coined over $600 million dollars from it domestically as well as internationally."
22462,True,"tom hanks was great in this movie. he really played the character well, showing his ups and downs, emotions, anger, joy and good character throughout the movie. it should be seen by everybody young and old. what is great about this movie is how it captures the emotions and events of this time period. young people who did not grow up at this time (and we are getting older than we think) should see all the happenings of this time. I know a lot of us have heard our parents talk about how things were, but the movie and every character really fit into their role and really captured the life of that time. forrest gump as we all know was ""special"" and had to face many hardships. because of that it would have been a little harder for him to succeed than the other characters in the movie. however we see that with his honesty, kind and good hearted character that he is able to surpass everyone in the movie and become a well respected, loving father that we all could call a role model."
22463,True,"I'd like to say first of all, that I absolutely love this film. When I first saw this film in the theater I was taken back by how flawlessly, the Director expressed the story of the title character Forrest Gump. I am surprised however, by all the Forrest Gump haters out there, who view this as some sort of propaganda machine, or film about a man who skates his way through life and achieves everything. Boo hoo, are those haters jealous because he did everything right or because he made ""a gazillion dollars""? Well, life is different for everybody. Maybe somehow, these people don't believe that something like this is possible? How could a simple, southern man from Greenbow, Alabama succeed when all he does is follow the direction of others? This films theme after all, (SPOILERS), is whether life is governed by destiny or, by chance? I won't get into a debate about that here but, lets remember this is fictional, and it's for entertainment. Don't take it so seriously...enjoy it! The acting by Tom Hanks is beautiful. It is hard to view Tom Hanks, now, as anything other than Forrest. His character was completely submersed in this role. The accent was spot on, and the journey through the south, (Alabama, Savannah Ga., etc), was remarkable. Forrest is portaied as immediately different from the supporting cast. He goes through the same course of life as everyone around him but, he achieves his milestones in a unique way that only makes sense, but possibly not, to Forrest. The title character always brings his definition of life back to what he was taught by his ""Mamma."" I think this is a very real, and touching way of showing respect to all the mother's out there who are constantly defining for their children what the world is about. The life of Forrest is logical only to him. He doesn't question the advice given by his mother as being wrong, and he stops at that. No further thought is involved, he takes the advice and uses it as he ""floats"" his way through life. Every scene in this film is used to convey how destiny and chance usually occur at the same time.All in all I give this film two thumbs, way up. I recommend for anyone who loves a great story, and wishes their lives could be this easy."
22464,True,"I have to say that no movie has touched me more than this one. Forrest Gump had to go though happiness, sadness, happiness, and sadness during his life. One of his BEST Friends, Bubba, died while they were at war. Bubba and Forrest were going to have a shrimp boat after the war but since Bubba didn't make it after the war Forrest took over the shrimp business. He made a restaurant called Bubba Gump's shrimp company. But one day Forrest's Mom passed away. So he put all the money he made from the restaurant into a funeral.I would recommend this movie to ages 13 and over because there are some very disturbing scenes. But if you love movie to make you cry, laugh, and smile this is a great movie for you."
22465,True,"So, what the hell is wrong with having a simple outlook on life? I think the reason we have a lot of problems in life is because we're too smart for our own good, that we always try to complicate things. I think that's what this movie was saying. Forrest Gump took life on its own terms, and he didn't sweat the little things. He just kept on keepin' on, and that's what the movie is saying. ""Don't sweat the small stuff."" You don't have to have an IQ of 75 to just relax and take it easy. Gump may have been smarter than most of his ""normal"" contemporaries. Contrary to what Jeanie said to him, he knows better than most people what love is. His loyalty to her in spite of the way she crapped on him until she was almost dead is a testament to that. Until the end, she was a dingbat.Forrest first lost his best friend Bubba in Viet Nam. Then, he lost his mother. Then, he lost his Jeanie. Through it all, he remained stoic. There is something very noble in that. Intellectually challenged or not, he was still a human being with feelings. He was smart enough to know what dead is, what right and wrong are. When it gets right down to it, that's all we really need to know. This is a great movie. My only complaint about it is this guy who wrote the screenplay obviously didn't know diddly squat about Bear Bryant. Bear was not a very demonstrative coach. He wouldn't have been jumping up and down on the sidelines screaming, ""Run you sonofabitch, run!"" Bear was always pretty stonefaced on the sidelines. Also, I can't help wondering how they made Gary Sinese look like he lost his legs. That was very impressive, whatever they did to do that. Also, intermixing Gump with now dead historic figures was very impressive, showing him shaking hands with JFK, LBJ, Richard Nixon, John Lennon. Still, number one is it is a good story. 9 out of 10."
22466,True,"The life of one man intersects through several pivotal and troubling moments of American history. Welcome to the very interesting life of ""Forrest Gump.""Playing the extremely likeable, title character is Tom Hanks. Born slightly ""slow"" with a crooked back, he will face many challenges as a boy and as an adult. Despite the mental and physical handicaps, Hanks is blessed with great strength and speed; and a warm and generous heart that will always lead him to where he needs to be. His God given talents and the love of his life (played by Robin Wright) will see him through school bullies, the Civil Rights march, college, the Vietnam War and the protest against it, the loss of loved ones, and a floundering business venture. This simple yet extraordinary man will seek his destiny as he goes through life, not knowing that he already fulfills it time and again since he was a child.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Forrest Gump"" is the part when Hanks uses his speed and strength to rescue wounded members of his platoon during an ambush in Vietnam.""Forrest Gump"" deserves its place as one of the movies that should be watched before you kick the bucket. It is funny, sad, uplifting, and very entertaining.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
22467,True,I love Forrest Gump. It is one of the best Tom Hanks movies I've seen so far. I love how Forrest will love and care for Jenny no matter what. I have seen this movie countless times and I can still keep watching it. It's that good.
22468,True,"Is this movie worthy of being the best film of 1996? Well, I have not seen The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction yet, though I definitely plan to see them eventually. I, myself love history and the fact that Forrest Gump is scene throughout history can be pretty funny. I love that he is but into real footage of real events or is watching even just simply watching them happen. One of my favorite scenes is when he is making a speech after the Vietnam War happened. Forrest Gump is very innocent and doesn't know what the rally was for. That's what makes Tom Hanks' character so great; he's just super likable! The score is worth noting as really good too. When Jenny comes through that water calling Forrest's name is just a nice moment...then she has to leave again...and again. Not that that's an issue, because that in fact helps the film keep moving. My one problem here is surprisingly the symbolism...a lot of people may disagree with me here. I like the symbolism, but when Forrest narrates what the symbolism is it feels very blatant and doesn't let us think much. A lot of stuff would've been much better without words, and I think would've risen my score a lot. The cinematography is, of course, outstanding. The U.S. as some great shots like the speech shot and his running shots but the most interesting one to me was Vietnam. It had such diverse colors that made the war scenes better than they already are. Lastly, it had a great story and plot, making it a story that would make you wanting to come back for more. I give this movie a: 9.3/10=9/10 overall"
22469,False,When I first saw this movie I didn't appreciate it like I do now. I think it may have been because I was so young when I first saw it. Just recently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. That life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. That we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there's no hope... I just love this movie. And anyone who hasn't seen it or who thinks that don't like it I seriously suggest seeing it or seeing it again. It truly is amazing...
22470,False,"I believe everyone has a right to their opinion about films or other topics. However from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the film maker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.I have a half brother who grew up in the Southern U.S. and on one occasion we were discussing this film and he said he felt it portrayed Southerners as dimwitted. I disagreed with him and informed him that the author himself was a native Southerner. The setting is central to this story in that it lets the tale unfold tying in factual events with the fable before us.The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels. From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation. Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend, he moves you with his character. Words don't grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys' tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright.I feel that much of Gumps' appeal is his downright sense of doing the right thing regardless of the people and situations around him and we see that in this film. That being the case maybe we all wish we could be just a little more like that, trying to maintain innate goodness and not the trade-offs we often make as we go down lifes highways.The movie has it all too,drama,comedy and it challenges societal norms as well. Then there are the almost endless quotes from the movie that have slipped into everyday speech. They are too numerous to say at this point.One of the toppers for me in the movie is when Forrest is in a quandary about life and wondering as Lt.Dan said we all have a destiny and his Mom says it is where we are all just floating around like a feather in the wind. Forrest's character terms it very well with this quote,""I think it is a little bit of both."" From my experiences in life it does appear to be that way. So if you have not seen the movie,see it soon you are in for a real treat. If you did not like it, give it a try again and hopefully you will see it for the great story it is!"
22471,False,"I have seen this movie easily a half a dozen times, and I find that the beauty of the film is how Forrest Gump not only shares his innocence and purity with others, including the audience, he also manages to retain that innocence and purity through some very difficult times. As a Viet Nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late Sixties, I could of course personally relate to the various periods that Forrest Gump endures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and period costume was enthralling. And yet it was so perfectly understated that Forrest Gump's travels through thirty five years of the stormiest and most meaningful years of American history only became clearly defined for the viewer. Even more so than the well known chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, I felt that the remark that stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us."
22472,False,"Quite simply, the greatest film ever made.Humour, sadness, action, drama and a Vietnam film all rolled into one.I'm not a stone cold, heartless villain, but it takes a lot to make me cry when I watch a movie. Bambi's mother, I couldn't care less. Jimmy Stewart in, ""Oh, what a wonderful life,"" - yeah right! The Lion King, when Mufasa bites the big one - on the verge.But seriously - I bawled my big brown eyes out, on several occasions in this film. A real tear-jerker, and a wonderful character, played to perfection by Tom Hanks. Every bit as worthy for the Oscar as Rooney was to win the Premiership in 2007.I cannot say it enough: This is THE film of all time. Watch it, and you'll see."
22473,False,"""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.10/10"
22474,False,"This is a powerful yet charming movie; fun for its special effects and profound in how it keeps you thinking long after it's over. Like others, I've seen this movie more than once. One comment I've never heard is that Forrest's simplicity is almost zen-like. I should read the novel to get the author's intention (I remember some people preferring the book and complaining that no one at the Academy Awards gave him any credit.) But rather than an implication that you should do what you're supposed to do and believe in God and you'll win in the end, I see it as zen-like, i.e., living in the moment and not having expectations or particular cravings (other than his loving Jenny.) So he ends up just stumbling into all the major historical events of the time. Granted, he achieves this only because he doesn't have the brains to think otherwise and actually have expectations, but so many of our problems are because we do have higher intellect and desires, which ironically makes us unhappy because we know what we are missing. We love our cats and dogs for the same simplicity and always being in the moment. There's a line in the movie wondering if everything is predestined or happens randomly or it's a combination of both. It is something to mull over for a long time."
22475,False,"He may have been good in Philadelphia but be is excellent in Forrest Gump.Tom Hanks delivers another great performance in his career by portraying the lovable,king yet not so intelligent character Forrest Gump.It is also Tom Hanks' second straight win for the Best Actor Oscar which he becomes the second man to do said accomplishment after Spencer Tracy.Whilst not as dramatic as Philadelphia,Tom Hanks' performance is just as great in this movie and this movie could possibly be the film of Tom Hanks' career as he used to be a comedy guy who turned to drama in a way which would paved for future stars such as Jim Carrey(The Truman Show),Reese Witherspoon(Walk the Line) and Will Ferrell(Stranger Than Fiction) to name a few.Also staring in this great movie classic are Robin Wright-Penn who plays Jenny,Gary Sinise who was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Lieutenant Dan Taylor,Mykelti Williamson as Forrest's best friend and shrimper Benjamin Buford""Bubba"" Blue and Sally Field as Mrs.Gump.This film was nominated for a total of thirteen Academy Awards but won six of them which include Best Film Editing,Best Visual Effects,Best Adapted Screenplay,Best Picture,Best Director-Robert Zemeckis and Best Actor-Tom Hanks.This is one masterpiece of a movie that will not be forgotten about in a long time.Bravo!"
22476,False,"I've seen most of the top-voted 30 or 40 movies here at IMDb, and Forrest Gump probably wins my vote for the single best movie ever made.This is not a conclusion I came to the first time I saw this film, or the second. The more you understand about this movie, the more you like it. And in terms of understanding it, my wife and I both were still gaining new understanding the 5th or 6th time we watched it. (For example: Why does Jenny behave exactly as she does throughout the movie? It'll take a lot of thinking to =fully= understand her.)Just the fact that we've seen it at least half a dozen times says a lot. There are few movies that I ever even give a second viewing. Like many of the truly good movies, there are people out there who see it once and consider it to be a waste of time. Such people are usually just looking for the most ""action,"" gore and sex they can find, and haven't a clue about films that actually involve thought, ideas, and life.Did I mention the script is absolutely brilliant? There are a lot of =truly= funny moments. And the music rocks. But those are only specific aspects of a movie that has just about everything else right about it as well.See it, enjoy it, think about it, see it again. Think about it some more.

22479,False,"I remember John Byner, the stand-up comic and impressionist of the 1970s talking about guys crying at movies, how it's not an acceptable behavior. He advised the men in his audience to drop their keys, do something that gets them to lean forward, wipe their faces, and get things under control.I dropped my keys watching Forrest Gump. Lieutenant Dan comes over the hill at Forrest and Jenny's wedding, new legs, fiancé at his side, clean-cut and happy.Forrest states the obvious, ""Lieutenant Dan, you gawt le-eggs!""And the water-works just started to flow.I sit up straight and clear my throat. Got 'em (the keys, that is). My wife leans over and gives me a kiss. She says, ""That's why I love you.""Other than a few historical fussinesses and plot slickeries, none of which are worth mentioning, this is as close to a perfect, emotionally-satisfying entertainment as I have ever seen.

It's filled with a patriotic decency you can only find in The Wizard of Oz and To Kill a Mockingbird.When Dorothy is aching for home and the Wizard can't deliver, I drop my keys.

22480,False,"This movie was amazing. It reminds me of my rises and falls in my life and just seeing how resilient Forrest Gump became was really inspiring. He had so much to offer the world, even when no one saw his ability to contribute to society. He did everything from leading a football team to a championship, to being a war hero. Even through the tough times in high school to the frantic relationship with Jenny, Forrest still remained humble and resilient. Any anti-bullying campaign, in my opinion, should use Forrest Gump as a prime example. Maybe even go as far as showing the movie. The movie also shows what it truly means to keep a promise. The promises that Forrest made to his mother, Bubba, Jenny and Lieutenant Dan were all kept. His love, passion, drive and spiritual understanding were all unconditional. What an amazing movie"

22484,False,"Forrest Gump (1994) is an awesome and breathtaking film directed by Robert Zemeckis. This is an exceptionally touching film with a great cast, excellent choice of music and a thoroughly pleasing narrative. Some of the dialogue in this film is now commonly quoted in everyday life which is a great achievement. It was a teeny bit long though, otherwise this film would have probably got a perfect scored.Despite Forest Gump's low IQ, Gump leads a truly charmed life, with a ringside seat for numerous of the most notable events in the late 20th century. without trying hard just other might do, Forrest teaches Elvis Presley how to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Yippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years.Meanwhile, as the remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest never forgets Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), the girl he loved as a boy, who makes her own journey through the turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s that is far more troubled than the path Forrest happens upon. Featured alongside Tom Hanks are Sally Field as Forrest's mother; Gary Sinise as his commanding officer in Vietnam; Mykelti Williamson as his ill-fated Army buddy who is familiar with every recipe that involves shrimp; and the special effects artists whose digital magic place Forrest during a remarkable array of historical events and people.In fact, nothing is quite pursued to its logical conclusion, which makes the film more a triumph of style than content. Nevertheless this is certainly what it is. Gump is not so much a measure of its times, as a benign reflection upon them, nearly but not quite through the eyes of its lovable protagonist. The film goes through all the emotions but does not appeal on any of them long enough to trouble anyone."
22485,False,"My friend suggested me to watch this movie. I didn't expect anything out of it, just wanted to pass some time. After the movie ended, I felt like I had never seen anything like this before.. It even made me write a review. Such a beautifully made movie, has got everything. Teaches you about the power of love and innocence. Sometimes we take our life as granted and all we think is we don't have anything. This movie tells you how to realize and work with all that you have, no matter how you are. Brilliant way of telling a story of a young boy Forrest and his life. Not only through the eye of Forrest, but a mother, a friend and general people. The way your innocence wins over anyone you come across is exceptional, and all you will leave behind is love and respect. Magnificent movie."
22486,False,"Spoiler Warning!!!! Forrest Gump is in reality a movie that covers a plethora of issues for example racial issues with the KKK and Black Panthers, drugs, peace, war, and finally disability. For this review I would like to touch on the disability portion. I must first say that even though this movie is mostly comedic it can still be said that it is partially accurate. In the beginning Forrest breaks off his braces to help with his scoliosis but broke them off to run away from bullies. Yet even though he had this disability against him he still had the ability to do it. So in reality this movie begins by saying that it's more about ability. I can prove this point further by saying that he became a war veteran with a medal of honour and also managed to become a millionaire and then evidently a successful father, even though Forrest was put in the situation that was impossible, and even if it was for comedic purposes it is much deeper, yet he still managed to come out ahead. Mostly a duration of the movie it is asked if Forrest is stupid, now Forrest doesn't like it and even though he may have a low IQ he still manages to pull through in the long run. This is also the case for Lt. Dan, he is in Vietnam harmed in battle and winds up with his legs amputated, later in the movie he gets prothstetics and is able to walk again, he also ends up being a millionaire because of his success in the shrimp industry. It's not that he is in need because he is disabled but is able to help because he is able. So in reality Forrest Gump isn't necessarily a film about specifically disability or otherwise it is something that shows how much of an ability you have whether or not you have a disability from birth or war or some other thing. It takes a will to do something and this is why I would give this movie a 9/10 because of its uplifting story and some form of motivation to do something with your life."
22487,False,"The movie Forrest Gump is about a boy who suffers from mental retardation. He also suffers with scoliosis and has to wear knee braces. The movie tells a story about his life and his accomplishments. He suffers bullying from the people in town and the kids in school. He grows up and proves a lot of people wrong. The story takes place in a small town called Greensboro, Alabama. Tom Hanks portrays the character Forrest Gump. This movie won eight Oscars, one of them being Best Actor in Leading Role. Tom Hanks won the award in 1995. He did a very good job of showing Forrest Gump without mocking his disability. We meet Forrest's character at bus stop talking to people on the bench about his life accomplishments. After that, the story starts with Forrest' first day on the bus. This is when Forrest first experiences the other kids bullying. Until he meets young Jenny, who lets him sit beside her on the bus. Young Jenny is played by Hanna Hall. Jenny becomes his best friend and doesn't look at his disability as a difference. Forrest and Jenny grow up together and spend all their time together. Jenny has an abusive and drunk father. Older Jenny is played by Robin Wright. Forrest gets many opportunities, he is asked to play football in college. You also see many history events and how innocent Forrest's eyes are to the world. The movie is told in the 1970s, a lot of movements happened in the seventies. The movie shows both Forrest's experiences and Jenny's life, vastly different. Jenny went through the hippie movement, with drugs and peace. Overall the film Forrest Gump is a great movie. It's definitely a movie you could re watch and still enjoy it as much as the first time."
22488,False,"Forrest Gump is a classic example of the sanctimonious garbage that people are willing to swallow simply because Tom Hanks is involved.  If the film had a more a satiric perspective maybe I could appreciate it.It begins appallingly and maniputively with a stereotypically Southern Sally Field and her idiot son 'FAUST' battling through tough times and meeting a whole lot of important people that real people like us will never ever meet. Elvis is one that is easily recalled. Through the remainder of the film we are supposed to endure one implausibility after another: Forrest meets the president, Forrest becomes a ping pong champion, Forrest becomes a Vietnam vet and Forrest discovers a cure for cancer! (well maybe that scene doesnt happen but i wouldnt be surprised if it was cut just prior to release). While people were going ga-ga at the way Forrest floats through life like a feather (a pathetic symbol that is ridiculously used in the film), i was seriously being sick.The central performance of Hanks is one that is truly embarrassing he is stiff, lifeless and codescending.  It seems as though Hanks' was studying children to breath life into Forrest, if this is so maybe he should put himself on their level rather than looking down at them as dribbling, pre pubescent morons. The remainder of the cast similarly sleepwalk through the one dimensional roles they are presented with,  only Gary Sinise deserves to garner any praise here.  The lines that spew forth from the characters' mouths were initially praised as incisive observations about our lives - WHAT!!!   They are dopey, uninventive and quite frankly wrong.  ""life is like a box of chocolates- you never know what youre gonna get"" - yes you do they are pictured on the back of the box.I would rather have a vital organ removed than recommend this dross to anyone over the age of five!"
22489,False,"Quite simply, this is one of the most despicable, offensive films ever made. It's central message is that if you shut up, do what you're told and never question anything, you will be rewarded. If you speak up for something you believe in, and it goes against authority, YOU WILL BE PUNISHED! (Like Robin Wright's character, who dies of AIDS). That this won Best Picture over the innovative Pulp Fiction is appalling (but then again, let's not forget that Titanic beat out LA Confidential, and The Truman Show wasn't even nominated) It deserves none of the accolades it recieved, and as for Tom Hanks' performance, well let's just say that any sitcom-level actor can play retarded with ease. A bad, bad, bad, bad film, and in the nastiest way possible."
22490,False,"This is one of the worst movies of all time. It is nothing more than an expensive, intricate jigsaw puzzle and none of the characters have redeeming value with the possible exception of Forrest's mother. His love interest Jenny is a vile human being and at no time did I want Forrest to end up with her. The off putting message IS in fact that you can be an idiot and be successful, and in fact suggests that it might be better to be so. The idea that skills that many people find so difficult to master all come so easily to a simpleton like Forrest is offensive. Its saving grace is that the book is even worse. I don't understand what people love about this movie, which is vastly overrated."
22491,False,"This film is one of my all time favorite film. He goes through life on a cloud, which could be each of us. I hated that she penned the baby on him, which is crazy. I love the fact of the Bama football, roll tide. This is a great film, powerful, magical, passionate. He had a good life, only thing he couldn't figure out why she just didn't love him. I loved the comedy, also didn't know Tom had it in him. This film had some very powerful moments, that are life lessons. The story is truly a ride of a life time. Whatever he put his mind too, he did it and was pretty good at it. I would've loved to be apart of this cast, very powerful."
22492,False,"Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is sat on a bench waiting for a bus. He's hardly the most intelligent person in the world, but he's definitely the most caring, heart-warming and relatable character to ever appear in film. Gump tells his story to other bus-waiters who come and go and only hear snippets of the whole tale. The path towards present day is packed full of events and achievements, some of which include the Vietnam war, meeting the President (twice), unveiling the Watergate Scandal and running non- stop for over four years. Sounds ludicrous. Above all else Gump has accomplished feats that would occur over many lifetimes. Tom Hanks though, fills Gump's story with tenacity. He has an eventful life, one full of ups and downs. Very sad, but very humorous. A great film controlled by its lead man."
22493,False,"I think it's the most beautiful movie i have ever seen The movie has it all too,drama,comedy and it challenges societal norms as well I have seen this movie easily a half a dozen times ""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time Tom Hanks' best performance He did everything from leading a football team to a championship, to being a war hero. Even through the tough times in high school to the frantic relationship with Jenny, Forrest still remained humble and resilient. A beautiful story.I can understand why it won 6 Oscars.Overall the film Forrest Gump is a great movie. It's definitely a movie you could re watch and still enjoy it as much as the first time.There is no way to define ""Forrest Gump"" as a movie. It can only be defined as art."
22494,False,"before I Started watching this movie for the first time, I thought I was going to watch a slow and boring movie, but after watching , I realized, I stupid I had been to judge this great movie even before watching it. I became a fan of Tom Hanks. I find myself similar to Forest Gump. I don't remember how many times I watched it, every time I watch it, I feel great. I took great motivation from this movie. Sound effect was great but most importantly the special effect used to bring back Ex Us President John F Kennedy was mind blowing. I recommend many of my friends to watch it and they all loved it. Tom hanks acting was out standing for what he won the Oscar eventually."
22495,False,"There are movies that you can stand up while watching, go to the toilet or get another bowl of popcorn, and than there are movies, that keep you bound to your chair till the end because it's heartfelt and spectacular plot is just too good.The latter is what this movie is. There is no way, anybody would be able to take their eyes off of this masterpiece directed by Robert Zemeckis. It combines one of the most beautiful screenplays in the 20th century and a score that keeps playing in your head until you peacefully fall asleep or just die and go straight to heaven.The leading role of Forest Gump is being played by an astonishingly good Tom Hanks - such a great performance! As well portrayed is the smaller role of the mother, played by Sally Fields and Gumps big love-interest Jenny, portrayed by Robin Wright.Boots the house down, this is a must-see movie for every generation."
22496,False,"This is truly one of the worst movies ever made. Forrest Gump just happens to be at every event which was important for US history the last 30 years. Maybe he was responsible for the assassination of President Kennedy and Dr Martin Luther King. When they showed the first landing on the moon I expected him to show up and shake hands with Neill Armstrong.Moral of the film: act stupid and you will become the richest bore in the world, act normal and you will be punished in every possible way.Furthermore don't you think that Mr Gump is an alien from outer space? Nobody knows his father, his behaviour is robotic and super-human at the same time and Forrest jr will conquer the world. A kind of one man ""Invasion of the Body-Snatchers""."
22497,False,"From start to finish, what a journey. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, it is at times funny and emotional. Though sometimes it can also deliver some action, this film is indeed an all rounded brilliant performance from Tom Hanks. This is a movie with a story that is actually interesting, unlike other films where there can be a long backstory which drags on and on.... With this film though you get to see Forrest from a young child grow to become a man that has a purpose in and sense in life. This story is well structured from start to finish and provides realism even in this day an age of what life starts out as and what becomes of us. I really enjoyed the fact Forrest experienced almost everything possible in life in this movie and showed us how he overcame and tackled the obstacles in his way, and also displayed the strength to overcome his weaknesses and loses in life."
22498,False,"This film was an instant classic for me. They don't write scripts of this calibre any more, which is a shame.Tom Hanks is brilliant as the mildly retarded Forest Gump. The film takes you by the hand, and shows Gumps life and experiences, both good and bad, in his own words from childhood to adulthood.At the same time you get a basic look at modern U.S. history. It is heartwarming and sad, funny and satirical. Cleverly weaves in so many sub plots and ideas. Yet doesn't use excessive violence or bad language to relate powerful messages in a heartwarming story. A story all the family can watch. A cracking film you can enjoy over and over again."
22499,False,"This has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. Despite the best efforts of the actors, most of whom are very talented, the ridiculous and corny plot makes this a real chore to watch.You get the feeling that the director was trying to make a modern ""Homer's Odyssey"", but ended up instead with ""Homer Simpson's Odyssey"" - sans laughs. This movie offers lowest common denominator entertainment: patronization to those with learning difficulties, a twisted view on history, naive jingoism, and a nauseatingly contrived ending.When I first saw this movie I began wondering whether I was being too harsh on it. However, after talking to between fifteen and twenty other people, I've come to the conclusion that I was being quite fair. None of those I've spoken to liked this film.If you like bubble-gum then you will probably like Forrest Gump. If however, you like movies with some semblance of intelligence or real entertainment you will probably be disappointed by this movie."
22500,False,"I usually do not write comments about films that I hate, but this film sucked so bad that I had to make an exception. This is one of the 10 worst films I have seen in my life. My profound apologies go out to those of you who loved this film, but I just couldn't stand it.Let's start with the plot, wait a minute, there is no plot. The only point of the film is seeing a not so bright man make his way through 30 years of history. Throughout his life, he fought in Vietnam, and saved Gary Sinise's life, who was very unappreciative of Forrest for doing so. He becomes a multi-millionaire in the shrimp business, he wins the international ping-pong tournament, meets 3 presidents, discovers the Watergate break-in, sees his mother pass away, and then wastes 3 1/2 years of his life literally running from coast to coast and back again. (right), and finally his one and only love comes back to him only because she is dying of cancer. Forrest Gump has been called the best feel good film of the 1990's, but I didn't feel good after seeing this film, and it's $350 million in the box office didn't inspire me to enjoy this film.The thing that surprises me the most about Forrest Gump was the fact that it took the Best Picture Oscar, even over Pulp Fiction, and The Shawshank Redemption. Two films that are so far superior to this one that I can't even believe it. For those of you who have not seen Forrest Gump, you're fortunate."
22501,False,"I recently saw this film again and was interested to see whether it had improved with time or I had mellowed in my opinion of it. Not a chance! The film looks even more tritely prelapsarian than ever. Basically the film is an unashamedly reactionary piece of brain candy floss, sickly and insubstantial. In this films universe Simplicity = Good Social change = Bad. Agents of social change = very bad and therefore they must contract AIDS. If it wasn't so nauseating it would be funny. Unfortunately, the Academy took it seriously and it picked up Oscars, when they should have booed it off the screen. Cynically sickly and morally bankrupt its a disgrace.Incidentally Jamie Russell in his book ""Vietnam War Movies"" wrote; ""Forrest Gump is Hollywood at its most horrendous...Whats most worrying is that the British Board of Film Classification saw fit to give this evil little film a U certificate. How can we protect our children against such insidious brainwashing"" How accurate an insight."
22502,False,"how could the academy be so out of touch with the American public that they believe this vile, uninspired piece of drivel, created solely to appeal to the lowest common denominators stupid younger brother, was worthy of not just one, but six Oscars? these were not insignificant awards that this film took home either. how does best director, best actor, best editor, best screenplay, and, oh, i don't know, best picture!!!! are you kidding me? what, the student films from miss o'malley's sixth grade class weren't allowed to contend? of course, they would have been too high-brow for the viewers who are allowed to speak for the masses."
22503,False,"I have to whole-heartedly agree with people who complained about the hype. I guess this movie was made to pander to the baby-boomers.  Why people insist that Tom Hanks is a great actor is beyond me.  Don't get me wrong, I thought he was brilliant on ""Bosom Buddies,"" I just wish he would return to the small screen.  I remember Bill Maher on ""Politically Incorrect"" remarking on Mr. Hanks winning the Best Actor award for this movie.  He basically asked how hard was it to portray an idiot?  I suppose Tom Servo's diatribe on MST3k accurately summarizes my opinion of this flick. Something like, ""Oh, so life is like a box of chocolates?  Oh yeah?  Well, I say life is like a c*** sandwich; the more bread you have, the less c*** you have to take!""  If only there was more bread in this movie!"
22504,False,"How can you start talking about a movie like ""Forrest Gump"" without being bias on the whole hype that has been surrounding it since it came out. For someone who actually knows about films, it is a personal insult that the Academy Awards considered this movie to be in higher standards than...
Pulp Fiction The Shawshank Redemption Quiz Show and even Four Weddings and a Funeraland how could Robert Zemeckis' (I hate that name) work be considered better than...Krzysztof Kieslowski for RED!!!!!!!!!!! Quentin Tarantino for PULP FICTION!!!!!! Woody Allen for BULLETS OVER BROADWAY!!!!!! Robert Redford for QUIZ SHOW!!!!!!! Not to mention that the Academy is such an airhead that Frank Darabont the director of The Shawshank Redemption wasn't even nominated!!!!!!Let's consider MANY important factors for this movie to be loved blindly, without a true sense of reflection and observation.Number 1: I have to much time on my hands,Number 2: It stars Tom Hanks who undoubtedly represents the white, flawless way of American Life. He is the Jimmy Stewart of today (that could not hurt). He is talented, but highly overrated. He has some excellent performances, but he always seems the same to me. He could never have the talent that actors like Gary Oldman, Ed Harris, Sean Penn, Russell Crowe or Denzel Washington have to reinvent themselves every time in a different role. He is the typical American male sweetheart, regardless everybody loves him. His star power more than his ability as an actor helped this movie to get sold and appreciated.Number 3: Stories about characters with disabilities always, and I mean always sell in Hollywood (Rainman, I am Sam, Nell, My Left Foot, Awakenings, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) not that I am saying that these great films compare to Forrest Gump, but the idea itself whether good or bad sells.Number 4: The history of the United States is taken rather lightly in this movie, all the events that take place around the character happen without his knowledge in the most unconvincing of methods. Racism, Vietnam, meeting a number of American Presidents, his unheard speech at Lincoln Memorial, the hippies, drugs, Bubba Gump shrimp, apple computers, amongst other historic events in which the character gets involved, but does not seem to grasp the magnitude of those very events. He is mentally handicaped as we are shown from the beginning, so because we are suppose to believe that he is emotionally handicap too. He never seems to get emotionally affected by anything, unless it involves Jenny, even then it does not appear to be convincing or moving in any way.Number 5: The story itself appears to me as manipulative, sappy, uncompromised and made in half measures. It touches certain issues, but never dwells on them with justice. The ingenuity of the character, his disability seems enough reason to feel that all the events are seen with a certain depth. Which they are not. It is unfair, because Hanks' charm and Gump's likeable stupidity work as a hook to entangle people's emotions. It never allows for anyone to make an effort to see beyond the  story and into the gut of what was attempted to be said.Number 6: Stupid moments, everybody loves them, Hollywood is an expert of what people like and what they want to spend their money on. Gump begins a ""marathon"" across the country for no real reason at all, half way decides he's had enough, by then the entire country was following him (as a metaphor for the movie itself). Elvis Presley the King or Rock ends up as a youngster, who knows how, in Gump's house as a visitor. Gump who has braces in his legs miraclously teaches him the dance moves that made him famous. Something that I personally cannot consider to be taken lightly is an issue like the Vietnam War, but Forrest somehow manages to run in and out the jungle in the middle war saving people left and right. Maybe Zemeckis never read a book or even watched a film (Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Casualties of War) to illustrate him on what really happened on that war. Young soldiers were getting killed by the dozen. Forrest Gump is a fairy tale based on unfounded grounds and hypocritical notions of ""reality"". Oliver Stone dedicated his film Platoon to the American soldiers in Vietnam, he went there for real and saw what happened. Zemeckis has decided to ignore all these factors and still believe that his adored character could even be immune to a experience like Vietnam (in every aspect possible).To conclude please do not let yourself be manipulated, not just because Forrest Gump won the oscar for Best Picture makes it one of the best films of the 90's. The ""sweetness"" of this movie is not even sweet, its only the a ploy, a sales pitch of the American Dream. In 20 years who will remember Forrest Gump, and more importantly who will remember that film when The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction are still in people's memories for real reasons. They are art films, Forrest Gump the oscar's favorite.And seriously folks if you haven't seen Kieslowski's RED run over to blockbuster and rent it. Its the end of the Color Trilogy. Then you'll know what we mean.thank you. VIVA EL CINE!!!!"
22505,False,"This movie, nothing more than a cheesy scenes needlessly thrown together, truly has no heart or point to it, and is among the worst that I have seen. It attempts to do everything without focusing its attempts. Just like the way that a person who tries to multitask only does a semi-good job on either task, this movie does no good job at anything. If the movie were sped up, it would seem like a parody of Hollywood films. I am honestly shocked that anyone enjoyed this film. Not only did the Oscars like it, they liked it more than ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", both among the best movies of all time,and both released in the same year."
22506,False,"Forrest Gump is a film that essentially decides to take a fictional developmentally delayed Southerner and insert him into several decades of history, having him interject with everything from George Wallace's anti-integregation push to inspiring Elvis' famous dance moves. This is simply a history trivializing gimmick, that is repeated dozens of times throughout the film. Three things basically happen in the film; Forrest does something amazing, he interjects in a historical event, but boy does he miss Jenny. This is constantly repeated as well. The message; that the wholesome, slow, never questioning Forrest is a hero while the nonconformist free thinking Jenny becomes an aids infected slut is problematic. The depiction of Forrest by Tom Hanks is one note and mind numbingly sentimental. Forrest Gump is not so much a movie as a one note concept stretched out to a bloated running time. Stupid is as stupid does, and this movie certainly is stupid."
22507,False,"This movie can really show the ups and downs of American society from the 1950s till the 1990s. Each time a come across this movie, on Netflix or on TV, I just watch it, maybe twice a year or more. For everyone who'd never watch it, buy/rent/stream this wonderful Tom Hanks' performance. It depicts the life of Forrest Gump, a mentally challenged man from Alabama and his close links through American history. The movie also covers the life of his siblings such as his mother (Sally Field) and Jenny, his childhood friend and lover (Robin Wright). This picture shows the great transformation of American culture and society during Forrest's 50 years of life."
22508,False,"We just watch this movie in school and I thought that this movie was so good! I have never seen so good movie as this is. This is not my favorite movie but I would like to put it one of the best movie of all time list. Tom Hanks was good actor and deserved his Oscar. The actress of Jenny was really good too and I would like to give her the Oscar too. If you want so see this movie then watch it! This movie gives me some chills and some power of the excellent movie. Robert Zemeckis is one of the greatest director I know. Haven't you seen it? Then buy it for your DVD or Blu-Ray. Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it!!"
22509,False,"Forrest Gump has always been one of my favorite movies, and it remains a classic of American films. From its ability to put Tom Hanks' character in different historic backgrounds to the amazing cinematography, this film never fails to entertain. I recommend it to anyone, regardless of preference of genre because this film has a little bit of everything.Tom Hanks is one component of makes this film so timeless. He is able to completely transform into this eccentric yet somewhat brilliant character of Forrest Gump and make us believe that he is real. I am able to say, with confidence, that this film would not be the same without Tom Hanks' acting."
22510,False,"The best film I have ever seen. If you are looking for something meaningful here's the stuff!!! Cinema is all about how it makes you feel. I think I felt in every possible way during this film at the right guantities the perfect moment. After this unsurpassed experience I became a better person or more specifically I knew how I wanted to be as a person. Life is all about goodness and how you can help your fellowman. You don't have to be smart, talented, gifted, handsome, tall. You only have to be hopeful. Have belief in your actions. Have belief in the world, even in the darkest hours. When you have witnessed pure love, affection, kindness there is only one thing to do. Share it, share it to the rest of the people. Even if people believe you're wrong and nothing will change. It will."
22511,False,"Forrest Gump is a masterpiece. This movie teaches you a very important lessons of life. Life is a box of chocolates, you never know what you gonna get. Tom Hanks delivers a one of greatest performance of all the time. He is one of the best actors Hollywood ever had. This review is spoiler free because i don't wanna ruin someone's movie by writing about it. Everything in movie is so perfect. Story, Acting, Music etc... Everything is great. THIS MOVIE IS AWEOME. 10 out of 10 without doubt. You cant hate movies like this. I don't know how people can hate this. You can do anything if you set your heart and mind on it. Thats what i learned from this movie. Not only this and much more. Watch it and you'll find out. 10 out of 10"
22512,False,"I can understand how this anti-counterculture propaganda piece was popular with right-wingers, but how on Earth it managed to receive any Award recognition is beyond me.  The faults are too numerous to mention, but here are a few.  The length: The film teeters on endlessly, adding no new insights to an extremely limited title character who is much less than a ""tabula rasa"".  The ""message"":  What exactly is the point of this film? To glorify Stupidity, and I am NOT speaking of ""simpleness"" as I have often heard when discussing this disaster on celluloid.  The message seems clear, if you are a thinking human being, like the Robin Wright character, you are destined to suffer through such horrors as prostitution and AIDS.  A stripper/folksinger?  Please.  Lovely special effects aside, this meandering piece of treacle is not only boring, but offensive.  The dumbing down of America is clearly alive in this debacle of the cinema."
22513,False,"Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) has an IQ of 75 and plays a role in many aspects of American history, everything from Elvis to Watergate to the smiley face to the integration of the University of Alabama.  The message of the movie is that if you are stupid and you always do as you are told, then great things will just fall into your lap.  The movie is beyond farfetched.  The movie is absolutely ridiculous and unbelievable.  The basic premise of the movie is ludicrous.  There is no way to make it work.  This movie is a real insult to the intelligence of the viewer.  Tom Hanks is totally obnoxious in this movie.  I never liked him anyway.The movie glorifies stupidity and treats us, the viewers, like we are stupid too.  When Forrest's mother says Forrest is named after General Nathan Bedford Forrest, we see a flashback of General Forrest.  When Forrest talks about Lieutenant Dan's (Gary Sinise) family, we see flashbacks of Lieutenant Dan's relatives.  I understand!  You don't have to show me!  The movie begins and ends with a feather drifting around, as if we are too stupid to get the message that Forrest drifts through his life aimlessly.  I get the point!  I don't need to see an actual feather!The soundtrack is irritating.  The songs keep breaking into the movie in a very annoying manner.  And they are so literal-minded!  When Forrest is running, we get `Running on Empty.'  When Forrest goes home, we get `Sweet Home Alabama.'  When Jenny (Robin Wright) walks out a door, we get `Don't You Love Her As She's Walking Out the Door.'Forrest's mother (Sally Field) does something absolutely despicable to keep Forrest in a school for which he is clearly not qualified.  Are we supposed to admire Mrs. Gump for her devotion to her son?  I do NOT admire her!The movie never even tries to explain how a person with an IQ of 75 somehow manages to graduate from high school and college and join the military. The movie expects us to simply accept this fact without question.  And what happened to Jenny's sisters?  The movie mentions them once and then conveniently forgets all about them.The only good thing about this movie is Gary Sinise.  He plays a believable character and gives a good performance."
22514,False,"This movie uses all the sappy, sentimental tricks in the book to sucker the audience into believing in poor, disadvantaged Forrest Gump: the sick mother, the bad legs, the innocence of incomplete mental capacity, the bullies, the girlfriend, etc.If that's as far as it went, however, I wouldn't be writing this. The dangerous thing about this movie is its sweeping generalizations and stereotypical portrayals of events, groups, and people in recent American history. Because the filmmakers have succeeded in getting the viewer to pull so strongly for Gump, they can then pass off their revisionist version of the past few decades with little objection from the viewer.Yes, it's just a movie, but images like these shape the way people think. The anti-war movement in the sixties and seventies and the Black Panthers, for example, were much more complex than portrayed in this movie. Using tiny, value-charged episodes to paint with such broad brush strokes, in settings that are designed to pull the viewer to Gump's side, is deceptive and manipulative."
22515,False,"First off let me be fair about the movie...nice special effects. Now with that said sit back and let me rip the hell out of this horrible movie. I personally think Paramount and Robert Zemekis were handing out their own batch of Jim Jones Kool Aid at every theater in America when this was out.From start to finish I dont think I have ever seen a movie (I say movie, because this is not a film) that is more predictable, melo-dramatic, or sterotypicable. How in the world this dreck won best picture is beyond me. I personally believe the Academy was doing Speilberg a favor and awarded his buddy Zemekis for making an overblown bad film. Lets face it if this movie only grossed 60 million it would have been cosidered a failure and would have won best special effects and thats IT!!! In my opinion this is Ishtar part 2, without Isabelle Adjani. This movie was a forshadow of things to come from Zemekis. Contact, Cast Away, What lies Beneath; although better films than Forrest Gump just proves Zemekis has sold his soul to the BIG HOLLYWOOD garbage machine. Come back Bob, you were once a promising director."
22516,False,"The fact that a movie of this caliber is given such an overall high rating reflects the disintegrating state of our civilization. Tom Hanks, as always, is obnoxious and unlikeable. How this guy garners such critical acclaim is totally baffling. It's almost like he didn't cut his acting teeth on the immortal ""Bosom Buddies."" Oh, wait, he has become a brash public believer in the impossible Oswald-acted-alone fairy tale. That always helps careers....To anyone that has a loved one with development difficulties, or has worked with handicapped people, Forest Gump is a pathetic and unrealistic caricature. Hanks's voice for the character is grating and unlike any I've ever heard, in the south or from any developmentally delayed individual. What kind of ridiculous accent is that? Even Rosie O'Donnell's laughable performance as a mentally challenged person was more believable than Hanks.The plot is beyond preposterous. All those famous people, all the crucial events of the times (at least by Hollywood historical standards), and this one very challenged guy just happens to be in the right place at the right time, over and over again. I love fantasy and far fletched plots, but this is not remotely possible under any circumstances.Again, those with personal life experiences in this area, know all too well just how horribly the handicapped and developmentally delayed are treated by all too many ""good"" and ""upright"" citizens. Gump seemed to avoid most of that, when he wasn't altering history. This film makes a mockery of those whose real disabilities make every day a real challenge. It's typical Hollywood, but even worse than usual. Maybe with another actor in the lead, who could give even a somewhat acceptable performance, this film might have been better."
22517,False,"For the life of me I will never understand the popularity of this movie. It is nothing more than a tedious, painfully melodramatic mess.The entire film is based on a gimmick that is repeated ad nauseum until eventually I just wanted to chew off one of my hands instead of watching another minute.  That gimmick consists of inserting Forrest into an historic event and watching him emerge triumphant.  That the film repeatedly has Forrest living through (and becoming a hero in) the most tumultuous times in recent American history---Vietnam, segregation, the Cold War, etc.---is an insult to the people who lived through those times.  To say that Forrest, with all his moronic wisdom, is smarter than those who actually experienced the event into which Forrest is digitally inserted is nothing short of an affront to America itself.One of the greatest tragedies in its Oscar sweep is that ""Gump"" won for Best Editing over ""Hoop Dreams,"" a movie culled from over 300 hours of footage. ""Hoop"" is riveting for every minute while ""Gump"" drags on and on with superfluous scene after superfluous scene.  Could that ""Forrest running back and forth across the US"" have possibly been milked any longer?  This lasts 15 minutes with no reason except to portray the passage of time.And as for Forrest's ""soul mate,"" Jenny, this little slut is a despicable character who abuses Forrest throughout his entire life, both mentally and emotionally, and shows him nothing but disrespect.  This character does not deserve our sympathy, she deserves our contempt.""Forrest Gump"" is woefully, abominably bad.  Its main gimmick is cute the first time you see the movie, but after one viewing the entire facade comes crashing down to reveal a redundant plot, mediocre acting (Hanks is an Oscar-caliber actor, but not for this dreck; he was better in both ""Cast Away"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"") and inept editing.In my opinion, this stands as the least deserving of all Best Picture Oscar winners.Rating: 2/10"
22518,False,"On the plus side, I think I saw this movie for free, or at the most paid $1 for admittance when I was in college and it was shown in the campus theater. On the negative side is everything else, most notably the movie's lack of empathy for any of its character.  Every character, not just Gump, is walking through this movie with no goal, no destination, and no clue, as to what the other characters are doing.  Someone off-screen must've just shouted ""move"" over and over again, and then filmed the result.  Gump goes here.  Gump goes there.  Sally Field says this.  Sally Field dies.  And so on.  The reasons behind the historical footage inserts is not to prove it can be done but to distract one from realizing how badly the rest of the film had come together up until the inserts.Anyone who cheers for this movie must also resemble a box of chocolates - flat, consisting of cardboard, and soon empty of their contents."
22519,False,This movie as an awful story line. I think It got an 8.8 because Tom Hanks is in it. Real it is an awful movie. 1 give it out 10 because it is crap. This movie so awful. Do not see it. It is a big pile of pooh pooh. Just do not see it. It is noting but hype. That is all it is. I do not no why people like this movie. It is so boring. It has some good actor. But it is so boring. I do not why people like it. The story line is so stinky. This is just crap. Crap crap crap. I can believe how popular this crap is. I think it got a I have never seen such a boring pile of crap in my life. The only Oscar this movie should have gotten was Oscar the grouch. Do not wast your time. And do not wast your money. Do not see this awful movie.
22520,False,"Wow. An incredible film. I watched many other movies of Tom Hanks, Now i understand that i made a great mistake by not watching this movie this long. This is such an epic. Terrific acting by Tom Hanks, dint knew that he was this versatile. The film just creates a very good feel inside you that even after watching it just hangs within your mind. Gump is spontaneous with great talent even though he looks retarded. Every scene in the movie drags our full attention into it, by the spontaneous actions of Gump. The movie's BGM is also perfect and syncs nicely with the scenes. Everything, everything is perfect for this film. Such films are extremely rare. This should have been a multi Oscar winner and indeed, it is. Watch it. No other words. Just watch and feel."
22521,False,"*** Momma used to say if you haven't seen this movie, skip the second paragraph, 'cause it's got some of 'dem magic spoilers *** Maybe my inner cynic finally got to me. I've seen ""Forrest Gump"" about seven or eight times altogether, and these last few viewing experiences left me with a bitter taste in my mouth.A few years ago I praised this film for being delightful, warm, inspiring, epic, etc. It was one of my top-ten favorite films. I loved it.I watched it again last night and was struck by how smug, contrived and self-conscious it is. It's almost sickeningly sweet - it's a fantasy (as I've always said) and all the characters live their lives to suit the story. I loved the poetic justice before - now it's kind of insulting.The character of Jenny is, story-wise, a nice addition because all fairy tales have the hero and his girl. The setup is firm because it presents her as the only girl of Forrest's life, the one person who accepts him for who he is - as she grows up and changes he's always there for her. The ending is a nice full circle. But the fact that the film kills her off is too righteous. It's like, ""Hey, she did the sex, she did the drugs - SHE DIES! Who cares if she had a change of heart? She's a filthy skank!"" Forrest's ""Momma"" is a right-wing Christian fanatical who has an obsessive hold over Forrest. She's a bit like the mother in ""Bubble Boy,"" except in this films she's presented as a hero.And finally we come to Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump. Last year I thought it was one of the all-time best performances in any film. Now, I can barely stand listening to him.It's all so smug and annoyingly sweet. ""Would you like a choc'-uh-lut?"" You feel like slapping the guy. Then taking his darn ""walkin' shoes"" and throwing them in a pool of gasoline and lighting them on fire. Along with his box of chocolates.Forrest's smug attitude is a bit too self-knowing for my tastes. It's like he's saying a big screw-you to all the people who disagree. He's Uncle Sam's Favorite American - the dumb guy who was too stoo-pid to say no to the government, and in return was awarded with millions of dollars and a happy, content life. All the Vietnam protesters were pigs, praise America.As far as ""retard"" characters go, Dustin Hoffman is still my favorite. Leonardo DiCaprio in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" is really good, too. But Hanks' performance is just a bit too self-confident and mugging - it's too damn innocent and naive.As I said, this used to be one of my very favorite movies. I loved it. It used to move me to tears at times. (Well, almost, anyway.) But I guess I've given my inner cynic too much room to grow - now I see it as a smug, annoying little journey through America's pop culture - with a message at its core that says, ""Don't mess with America - or you'll get the Gump."" America has enough blind love going already."
22522,False,"Let's go over the two main ideas at the root of this story, shall we?1) If you do everything you're told for your whole life, including fighting in a war that shouldn't have occurred, you will be rewarded with fame and fortune.2) If you question your government, you will begin a slide down a slippery slope that will lead inevitably to drug abuse, prostitution and attempts at suicide.In this contemporary parable, financial success is inextricably linked to moral virtue -- with the obvious corollary that the poor are immoral and unvirtuous. The film says as much with its portrayal of Lieutenant Dan: he is ""living off the state,"" and, as a result, he is a self-loathing, ineffectual alcoholic. Curse that welfare state. When he becomes an entrepreneur on the other hand his life turns around and he ""makes his peace with God."" Moral virtue, incidentally, is defined as unquestioning loyalty to a higher power, be it America or God -- in fact, the two are pretty much the same thing.And they say Hollywood is too liberal."
22523,False,"This must be one of the most offensive movies ever made and I am truly appalled at the central theme, namely that being stupid makes you a better person.  Everything about this film is patronising and overwrought.  Can't believe that Tom Hanks (surely the most over-rated actor on the planet) won an Oscar for this pulp and if this was the best film of 1994 then god help us all.Don't waste your money at the video store - rent something (anything) other than this garbage."
22524,False,"A movie with this many comments obviously has great resonance. On the one hand, the movie is technically skillful, well-acted, and used then-advanced special effects to great advantage. As demonstrated by the comments here, it has charmed many viewers. On the other, the movie's values and message are clearly right wing: as many other reviewers point out, the plot rewards ignorance, unquestioning obedience, and laissez-faire corporatization (the marks of a good heart, apparently!), while it trivializes retardation to charm viewers with a saccharine vision of idiocy as goodness. It provides a right-wing allegory of recent US history by punishing the free-thinking Jenny and rewarding the mindless Forrest, named after Nathan Bedford Forrest, a founder of the Ku Klux Klan. Charming!I share the view of those who not entertained by the movie's right-wing allegory of Reagan-Bush era know-nothingism and historical blindness. As another commenter put it, ""this is a movie for people who voted for Reagan"" or for the Bushes. Overall, it's a remarkable document of Reagan-Bush era dominant thinking.So the basic situation with this movie is not too difficult to grasp: the movie is skillfully made and acted, and the wide success of its right-wing plot and message demonstrates that the American movie-going public largely shares these right-wing views."
22525,False,"I almost walked out of the theater when I saw this movie. I usually love Tom Hanks, but his acting was wooden and his character was unbelievable. I was very disappointed when it received an academy award. The movie was supposed to be inspiring, but it's hard for me to be inspired when there's so little that's recognizable about a character. I think the reason the box of chocolates line was quoted so much was that that was all that was memorable about the movie. One ""effect"" that I especially disliked was the technique whereby Forrest Gump was included in old footage. In addition, I found myself worrying about Sally Field's career. There was a period in her career when she was in some excellent movies and this role as a pitiful mother definitely seemed like a step down."
22526,False,"I think of Forrest Gump (1994) directed by Robert Zemeckis as a fantasy or a fairy tale set in the real world, and what a marvelous tale it is. It's been 15 years since I saw the film for the first time with my 13- years-old son. We were impressed, touched, and moved by it equally. We laughed, we could not contain tears, and we lived together with the hero, the childlike, naive, and innocent Forrest Gump, the most unusual lead character you can think of. FG was a big hit when it was released, and it went on to receive 6 Oscars including for The Best Picture, Director, Best Actor, Best Visual Effects, and Best Screen Play. The film's Oscar status has made it one of the controversial choices among the film viewers. Some completely agree that FG deserved all its awards and its love. The others, and quite few to that believe that the film is totally overrated, sickly sweet, and it is nothing more than the American propaganda of mediocrity. They believe that the film's main idea is, follow the orders, do what you are told, and even if your intellect is low or almost non-existent, with a little bit of luck, you would achieve the success in your life and even would change the history by simply being at the right place in the right time. How wrong I believe they are. You can't think of Forrest Gump as a real person. He is a fairy tale character, or rather the embodiment of a human with no cynicism whatsoever, the candid, pure, innocent man who is not quick or witty but who knows bad from good and right from wrong and through whose eyes we see the historical events in the live of this country for about thirty years of the last Century. Forrest may not be an intellectual prodigy but he was led through life's hardships, by the inner moral compass if you will and he knows the very simple truths that he never misses - love and loyalty to his mother, his friends, the girl he loves and his Country. The movie covers the look at America not only from Forrest's point of view. Another look at alternative, rebellious, counterculture America was very well presented through Jenny's life. Between them two, I believe the film's creators were able to show the changing times and changing face of this country. Technically and visually, the film is a marvel. The best songs of the time that were used in the film soundtrack are great and I don't mind them sound almost all the time -the more the better. Tom Hanks had achieved the very difficult task. His Forrest is simple but not laughable. He is a decent and very good man. It is not easy to create such idealistic character and to make him alive and sympathetic. There is not a single false note in Hanks' performance, and he absolutely deserves the Oscar. When I rewatched the film recently, it touched me as deeply now as it did 15 years ago, and this is for me the sign of not just good but a great movie. And that's all I have to say about Forrest Gump."
22527,False,"This film clearly falls into the Love/Hate category. I think it's one where either you like the principle idea of optimism or you detest the idea that life is simply handed to you and all you have to do is throw it away.I for one hated this film. Not for the acting, which I didn't rate very highly, although Sinise put in a good performance in my view, I'm even a fan of Hanks other work but didn't particularly enjoy his performance here. No, I hated this film for its message which I found to be so central and pervasive that I couldn't enjoy any of the rest of the film's supposed qualities. The message I got from this film was that it makes no difference what you do in life, no matter how hard you work, how talented you are or how much you believe, if you just let life go past you, obey and be good then you will be a huge success. It's a belief I see more and more and one which I find abhorrent.Strangely enough it seems that this belief is becoming true. Make an average film with average acting and you too can have a huge box office success and win multiple Oscars.Perhaps this is then a truly brilliant and ironic piece of work. I still hated it."
22528,False,"I love Tom Hanks, but the fact that film has enjoyed such popularity seems to me to be a sign of the endless American thirst for the milk of amnesia.  Anyone who cares about any of the historical events ""depicted"" in this film -- especially the war in Vietnam -- ought to be offended.  Anyone from the south ought to be offended, too, at the way Hanks' and others' southern accents are used as signifiers of imbecility, and that imbecility then romanticized.  And lastly, African-Americans ought to be outraged at the way Mykelti Williamson -- a very fine actor, by the by -- is used to slip the worst of stereotypes in under the ""comic"" door.  When we look back fifty years from now, this will be the ""Bedtime for Bonzo"" of its day.#1 on my list of all-time worst films."
22529,False,"Every so often there are movies that seemingly get released right at the right time and subsequently become cultural phenomenons beyond their creators' wildest dreams. These movies often largely retain that success and esteem over the years (Gone with the Wind, Star Wars and Jaws among others) or age poorly and get viewed as undeserving of their huge success at the time (for instance, Independence Day). Although no movie appeals to absolutely everyone's taste, Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump certainly can be said to belong more in the former category. Released in 1994 it raked in nearly seven hundred million dollars worldwide, becoming the second biggest box office hit of '94 (after The Lion King) and mopped the floor at that year's Academy Awards, winning six trophies including Best Picture (although I prefer Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption by the tiniest of margins, but this isn't about those two), Director and Actor. It's a classic that, after first seeing it in 1997 when I was 9, has stayed with me to this day. I'm about to explain why.I don't think there's any need for me to talk about the story, so let me begin with the cast ensemble Zemeckis assembled for this film. Sally Field will always be Mrs. Gump to me, and she turns in a beautiful performance as a strong woman with integrity who vehemently refuses to think of her son as a retard and does her best to make sure he never sees himself as one. An Oscar-nominated Gary Sinise is riveting as the hard-bitten but scarred military man Lt. Dan who comes to learn from Forrest the values of redemption and selflessness. Robin Wright Penn is heartbreaking as Forrest's free-spirited but deeply troubled true love whose life takes a very different route to Forrest's, and Mykelti Williamson also gives a very touching turn as Bubba, the African-American young man with a heart of gold who becomes Forrest's best friend in Vietnam.But at the risk of sounding like a hyperbolic and dangerously obsessed fanboy, I daresay the acting masterclass Tom Hanks puts forth here is the finest display of acting I have ever witnessed. No other actor before or since has made such a convincing transformation into the heart, body and soul of another person as Hanks does here. Every delayed or confused mannerism is spot-on, his Southern accent is flawless and his every emotion letter-perfect. In the whole film, particularly the grave scene towards the end, you look into his eyes and you don't see Tom Hanks, you see Forrest Gump. Utter perfection.Many will say the storyline is a contrived, manipulative and even conservative affair (and, admittedly, in some respects they may be right), but they're oblivious to the darker subtext in Eric Roth's screenplay and the many postmodern storytelling methods Zemeckis deploys here. While we watch Forrest encounter so many historic people and events, we see Jenny experience the negative side of '60s and '70s counterculture as she protests the Vietnam War, embraces alcohol, drugs and illicit sex and also for much of the film's duration Forrest's impairments are exploited for laughs. When we analyze this side of the story the film becomes much darker than it initially seems. The unconventional methods Zemeckis uses in telling Forrest's story enhance this  in his narration he discusses things that are yet to happen and the placing of Tom Hanks into old footage of the real-life events gives the movie a revisionist historical feel.Another huge plus is the soundtrack, containing most of the greatest artists from the '50s to the early '80s.Forrest Gump's charm and appeal is timeless, and its artistic craft is even better. It's a rollicking tapestry of American history from the '50s to the '80s (both good and bad), driven by a powerhouse ensemble cast and a brilliant crew working on a brilliantly constructed screenplay filled with dozens of lines that have entered the lexicon, all brought together by the love and passion of a genius director. Forrest Gump is a classic that will look handsome in any DVD collection, and is yet another movie that never leaves me feeling amazed no matter how much older I get. A true classic."
22530,False,"I think that the best movies are those that you 'appreciate' or understand after seeing it more than once. However, with 'forrest gump', i fell in love with it after the first 15 minutes and knew it would be in my top 10 straight away.It is so unique because of the character Forrest Gump himself, who has a low IQ of only 75. Although he is 'mentally challenged', he finds himself in historic and troublesome situations and like that he manages to 'forrest gump' his way out of it and end up a hero or role model. but the real beauty in this movie to me was his ability to simplify the complexities of the world we live in and somehow do what some war movies fail to do. show the importance of world peace or what love movies can't deliver...the importance of love.I love that Forrest doesn't lose his innocence and purity throughout the movie, or maybe he just can't but either way, this shows you don't need to be evil or really intelligent to be recognised or successful. Then again it is just a movie (and a very good one too). So maybe it doesn't work like that in reality. what that simply means is that the acting and story of this film was incredibly touching on a real level. And in my definition that's what a good movie should be able to do.Every award the movie received was well deserved especially Tom Hanks. Now that's an actor for ya. I love this movie and don't hesitate to give it a 10."
22531,False,"One of the best movies I have ever seen - It made me realize truth and innocence still lives. The love he had was pure. I cried watching this movie. Also the way in which the story goes -the political element in it -very accurate and nice. Also every character in this film100/100 for the director and story writer - Not to mention the extraordinary legend Tom Hanks....Tom Hanks, Robin Wright Penn, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson - every one has played their part beautifully.If U haven't seen this movie - you are missing one of the greatest movie ever made...."
22532,False,"Not being Tom Hanks' greatest fan, I avoided watching this film for several months after its release. This also gave me time for the hype to die down a little - but on the back of all the press and several positive comments I was still expecting to sit down to enjoy a good movie.I was mistaken. My reward? Two hours of praying for the credits to roll to take away the pain.To me this movie takes pleasure in displaying everything that is wrong with the Hollywood film industry - America's need to rewrite history to suit its own needs, its desire to peddle the ""American dream"" myth and the rewards given blindly to any movie that does the above (in the form of several Oscars - could anyone please explain to me the exceptional qualities of the movie that put it above anything else released that year?If only Forrest had kept running... into the sea"
22533,False,"Perhaps one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen.  I fear for a society that adores and embraces a movie without looking beyond the surface. This movie is, at its core, a celebration of mediocrity.  Sort of like the current popularity of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,"" (which lets the average person feel smart because they can answer easy questions) this movie is designed to make the average person feel great about themselves for being nothing more than average, just like Forrest.I agree with the comments that infer a fascist or totalitarian subtext to this movie.  This movie is designed to sedate the viewer into feeling as if the world is fine and dandy just the way it is, and that they too, without doing anything at all to improve, educate or enlighten themselves, can be a ""success"" without trying.  A satisfied public is easy to control, for better or for worse . . ."
22534,False,"You've got to give it to the makers of this film, they certainly tried every trick in the book to wheedle reactions from viewers.  A person with a disability who manages to triumph through the most extreme and traumatic situations thrown at him.  Was this meant to be some sort of metaphor for ""the American Dream"", whereby citizens by rights should triumph through whatever adversity is thrown their way, coming out the other side richer and stronger?  Give me a break - or at least, show it to me in an intelligent, thoughtful, non-manipulative way!The scenes with Forrest intercut into historic footage were quite nice, though."
22535,False,"Implausible, unbelievably mawkish and sentimental, the high regard that viewers and reviewers have had for this film baffles me. Nobody should be forced to watch this trite and smug piece of film-making more than once, apart from the writer responsible for the ""Life is like a box of chocolates..."" line, who, if there is any justice will find himself stuck in hell watching it for all eternity."
22536,False,"(0 stars preferably)I must be the only one who HATED this movie. I know that most of you really love it, but I don't. I just don't see the point. It's just some idiot (nothing against mentally disabled people, but he's an idiot) sitting there telling his stupid story. However, NOTHING HAPPENS! He talks about all of these things that happened to him, but it doesn't matter. Would he be any different if these things didn't happen to him? No. Does any of it affect the plot of the movie? No. Does it matter that he happened to be in certain places at certain times? No, not unless you count that they got to show off the technology to splice him in with historical footage. Also, how exactly is it believable? He walked across the entire country. Right... He invented the smiley face. Right... He did a bunch of other stupid stuff that I have forced out of my mind because I HATE THIS MOVIE. Right... I just don't buy it. I can't. I wont. Neither should you. Nothing even happens until the very end of the movie. ""But,"" you say, ""the ending wont mean anything if you didn't see the rest of the movie. That's what the movie's about."" No. It's not. The movie's about nothing. The end is pointless, as is the rest of the movie. It's not funny. It's not magical. It's not believable. It's not realistic. IT'S NOT GOOD!If I never hear another ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" or ""Run, Forrest, Run"" or see a Bubba-Gump Shrimp place, it will be too soon."
22537,False,"Because my English is not quite up to the task, I'm going to borrow the words of another reviewer from the UK: ""a nauseating piece of reactionary twaddle"". Frankly I couldn't put it better - this is right wing propaganda at its worst; all the more so because it's wrapped in (mostly) competent directing and acting (although Gary Sinise's ""performance"" is frankly irritating). Sorry let me rephrase and apologize to right-wing people, who are entitled to their political views: this movie is (bordering on) fascist propaganda.There is so much to love about America, ""Forrest Gump"" brings out the worst in it. An insult to anyone's intelligence - I hope it gets remembered as the ""Leni Riefenstahl's movie"" of the Reagan area."
22538,False,"I am sure there aren't many people who have never seen this movie.If you haven't,make sure it is the next movie you see.You can't help but to fall in love with the title character.Tom Hanks has never let me down.This is a character that you can laugh at,cry with and feel all of his true emotions.This is a man who has literally done everything in his life,yet he is a very simple man.One of the 50 best movies I have ever seen,and I have seen a lot of movies.Maybe in the top 25.This is also one of the best family films I have ever seen."
22539,False,"It is all about Shrimp.Forrest Gump show us how a well done thing is the best way to achieve great results. This stories is about so basic things, but so amazing at same time, we understand that sometimes be idiot is good. Forrest isn't the most intelligent man, in really Forrest is just talented, but he don't know, in reality we are like he. He can make things so big, and he can make things who inspire millions. Forrest is a example of don't plan your life, just live your life. This is the main argument: you don't need to be the most intelligent people in the world, you just need to be your self, and you will find follow in the most crazy you can imagine, because it is life, it not logical, but it is how works."
22540,False,"From harsh bullying to the creation of milestone characters that have shaped our world. Forrest Gump delivers an inspiring journey in search a long searched unconditioned love. I have been watching this movie once a year since I was a kid. I love everything about it. Seeing the world through the eyes of Forrest Gump is needed from time to time. The naive interpretation of the world that Forrest delivers, will hand you a very useful perspective of the event to come in your own life. Getting through this movie without feeling love, hurt, happiness and even nostalgia is always an impossible task. For you out there who have not yet seen this movie, get to it!"
22541,False,"This movie will never get old and cannot be duplicated. Tom Hanks has done a phenomenal job bringing out this disabled character from every aspect never missing a beat. From childhood memories of bullying to just growing up and trying to be accepted,this film makes you think about your own life and become grateful. It gives you a sense of hope in knowing you can be somebody that makes a change in this world. Full of emotional drama, action, and a little bit of comedy ""Forrest Gump"" is an all time favorite. Ten out of Ten hands down one of the best Films created. Watching this movie lets you see it from the eyes of someone who wasn't born with the glamorous or perfect lifestyle. I learn and see something different every time I watch it."
22542,False,"This film is incredible... And Tom Hanks is the greatest actor ever.. Watched every movie he acted.. Inspiring movie.. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. I just love this movie. And anyone who hasn't seen it or who thinks that don't like it I seriously suggest seeing it or seeing it again. It truly is amazing... How can somebody say that Forrest is just an idiot, an ordinary person who does everything that he is told to do? It appears to me that in fact,in his innocence, Forrest does what he feels he has to do,no matter the situations and the people around him, lead only by an inner sense of right. So what actually seems to be special about Forrest is that, regardless of his intelligence, he has the capacity to discover simple truth and life values that all the others around him miss: he tries to save Bubba endangering his own life, he gives Bubba's family money and mainly displays simple goodness in everything he does."
22543,False,"I believe the cast; as a whole, were amazing...but this movie is the whole reason I absolutely love Tom Hanks! His performance was outstanding to me! This movie has such a heartfelt message, you can't help but fall in love with it (unless you're a heartless piece of trash that is). Following Forest's life story captivates you from the beginning as you learn all the hardships he had to overcome starting from a very young age and ending with the present in the movie (after he finishes telling his story and you follow him in the present). It's just hands down an amazing movie that made me cry and smile, laugh and yell in anger, and helped me realize judgment is the worst crime anyone can commit!!"
22544,False,"Forrest Gump Forrest Gump is about overcoming the borders set up by others. While his mother always knew something was different about Forrest, she never criticized him once. When he was called stupid he was told to just say ""stupid is as stupid does. These are the things that help this disabled her through life.with all the strugglesSummary The story starts in the picturesque town of green bow Alabama where a boy is getting ""magic shoes"" put on his legs to get his legs straightened. as it progresses boy meets girl, girl likes him as a friend etc. they teach each other how to hang and swing and play. she always looks out for him to when he is getting chased or bullied, she is always there to yell ""RUN FORREST, RUN"" later in the film however things change after going off to college he becomes the star running back of Alabama university after 5 years he graduates, and off to war he goes war he meets his best good friend Bubba Blue after a surprise attack Forrest spends time healing with his future first mate Lt. Dan he goes on to master a little sport called table tennis he becomes an Olympic world champion and buys a shrimp boat with the money. after making a fortune off shrimping he goes on a journey across America running all the way. After the run he goes to her in Georgia. Forrest story ends fairly soon after this but I will leave that for you to see."
22545,False,"Awesome movie! This is my favorite movie. The story, the soundtrack and the actors (Tom Hanks is excellent in this role)is very well composed. Although Forrest Gump is considered ""dumb"", he manages to do great thing with his life. A classic, definitely watch it! 10 out of 10. A lot of laughs, serious moments, sad parts, and interesting scenes combined into a jumble of greatness. Forrest does overcome many obstacles, which makes this movie even greater. A classic in my opinion. If you have ever considered watching the movie, pop it in, sit down and prepared to be mesmerized by this spectacular movie. I hope you enjoy this movie and much as I did!"
22546,False,"The tale of Forrest Gump has always been awe-inspiring. In my youth, I would curl up on the couch with the family and watch it religiously. We would quote it, laugh, and reminisce of our favorite parts.Growing up, I have come to realize that the ambition that Tom Hanks portrays as Forrest is definitely something to be desired. I always connected with his character and never truly understood why. It wasn't the low IQ. I am quite intelligent. It wasn't what he accomplished. I have only done a handful of things, none of which are noteworthy. So reviewing this film as an adult, I realized I was watching it through a different pair of eyes. At first I thought the movie had changed. No... I had. The reason why I connected so much with Forrest are two-fold.First, his desire for strong relationships. There were so many people that shunned him and hated upon him, much of which I can relate to. However, throughout the film, we remember his relationships. The love he has for the character Jenny is so strong, it keeps him loyal throughout his entire life, despite always taking second to someone or something else. He knew what his heart wanted and waited patiently for his time. His relationship with his ""mama"" is definitely on to be desired. Sally Field brought a nurturing side to her son who already had shortcomings from childhood. Yet, she always used positive reinforcement to encourage him and build him up. His relationship with his Army buddy Bubba was something truly remarkable. In times of hardships, a man who he barely knew, he risked his life for. Granted, throughout training they did get to know some about each other, but the fact that Bubba treated Forrest like an equal is something so commendable and it makes me want to be a better person like that. Forrest's relation ship with Lt. Dan was, albeit, an unhealthy one from the start, but even though Dan was a loner, gave up on life, and despised Forrest for saving him in Vietnam, he ended up living a full life with his new wife, who could see past his disability and truly love him for who he was underneath.These days we don't see people behaving this way anymore. Almost like respect is beneath us. I will treat a custodian the same way I treat a President. People say respect is earned. No... respect is given. It doesn't matter who you are, what matters is who you are. Within. I know that last statement may sound redundant, but I'm sure some of you (hopefully all of you) can see the meaning for what it's worth.Secondly, Forrest's financial gains. Throughout his life, he accumulated a substantial amount of wealth. The greatest thing? He didn't let it change him. He was the same Forrest he was as a child as he was after his accomplishments throughout his amazing life. There was no greed. There was no revenge. There was no backstabbing. There was no hate. Just love. All he did throughout the film... was love.It is because of my thoughts on the film that truly make me reflect and want to be more like Forrest. Despite hardships, disabilities, and hate promoted everywhere he went, he rose above it all to maintain his self-respect and his dignity. He chose not to let outside forces change who he was within. I love him for that.To Tom Hanks, should he ever read this review: You did a splendid job. I wish words could express how much I truly enjoyed your portrayal of the great Forrest Gump, but all you need to know is that, as a child, it brought me joy and laughter. As an adult, it did it again, just in different ways. I commend you and I thank you.I guess it turns out that life is like a box of chocolates..."
22547,False,"You can watch this movie over and over again, and it gets better every time. Every time it comes on television I go out of my way to watch it, because of how great it is. It's got memorable characters, unforgettable lines, and laugh out loud moments that will make you laugh every time you watch it. Forrest Gump is also remarkable in the fact that it is a stunning recap of the greater part of the 20th century including historical moments like, the Watergate Scandal, Vietnam War, the integration of the University of Alabama, and much much more. If you haven't seen it yet I recommend you see it immediately. A timeless classic that will have to captivated the whole time."
22548,False,"After my father did a course during the which there was quite some talk about autism, how it works and such I finally got to see again this movie that I had seen only once at a very young age. There are several things (E.G. /MILD SPOILER/ the fact that Forrest is very good at Ping pong because he's able to focus on the ball) that suggest that Forrest is not stupid and retarded, more autistic. Which basically destroys all the accusations of the movie being a ""Sentimentalistic ode to stupidity and ignorance"".There are various things with which you can explain why ""Forrest Gump"" is truly one of the best movies ever. 1st is the acting, not only of Tom Hanks, but also of several other cast members, highlighting Gary Sinise. Another thing to praise is the music. Alan Silvestri truly was able to touch with this movie's music.Some consistent criticism is driven towards the story. The fact here is the problem with understanding that this is what they call ""Modern fable"", a story set nowadays that is meant to be touching and talks about what happened in that time, similarly to ""The legend of 1900"" or ""the curious case of benjamin button"". This genre seems to not be understood by a pretty consistent number of viewers, therefore receives a limited amount, but present amount of hatred.Then, when I understood that some haters of this movie are angry because it seems to have stolen the accademy award away from other movies such as the shawshank redemption and pulp fiction I understand that it's just unreasoned hatred. Go watch it, it's truly wonderful."
22549,False,"This is my favorite movie from a long time. Robert Zemerick has been my 3rd favorite Director after Christopher Nolan being 1st & Steven Spielberg being 2nd. The music takes me to a different world. I watched this movie when i was small. When I watch it these days , i learn a lot about life. Nothing is impossible . You can be good at anything. This movie will take your Evil Ego off from you. A Good movie will make a viewer say "" Wow, what a Movie.."" & the Best Movie will not even give a chance to think about the movie because it would've made him feel that its not a movie but Real things going around him there which is changing his life.Thank You Robert & Thank You Tom... We love you"
22550,False,I find this movie funny and also a pleasure to watch. Each time I have watched I find something new the message of this movie. Great cast. Tom Hanks was awesome. The Message of this movie for me is never give up and no matter what people say or do you can always move forward with what you want to do. I love the fact that he was in the army and even though he was not welcomed he made a long and lasting friends. Another thing is that he was always keeping his faith in God strong and true. He is an honest man and his momma raised that way. She did what was best for him.even though at times is didn't seam like it. And last thing Is that no matter what life throws at you. Have the strength and courage and faith to always keep your head up move forward. There are always things in life that is always going to blocking your path to happiness get through them
22551,False,Forrest Gump is one of the most delightful movies of the 1990's. This movie has it all and delivers it all in a manor that will captivate your imagination and will pull the strings of every sense you have. Tom Hanks delivers one of the best performances of his life and brings Forrest Gump to life in so many ways. If you are a big fan of Being There with Peter Sellers then you know the direct link between the two movies. Anything is possible and that is exactly what is delivered in one of my favorite movies of all time. The cast is great and everyone plays their part in this epic movie. I saw this in the box-office eight times and cried every single time and I still do. Great movie and amazing cast! If you have never seen this movie do so today. You will be thanking yourself!
22552,False,"I was long ago planing to watch this movie and when my lecturer from university told us in a lecture about him I finally decided to watch it. It's a great movie. Really touchable and inspiring story.Forrest Gump is nothing special, they don't even believe he is able to graduate school like normal kids, but his mother does. She never gives up on him and support him. She is the exact parent which a child like Forrest needs to grown up right. Without any expectations of big results Forrest gets beyond his possibilities and started running though his life really fast. Even though he is not with a special intellect potential he achieves everything that he wants. He is doing what he wants in the moments, when he is enjoying it and he succeed. Nothing stops him to get what he want, people's opinion is not important for him. This movie is example for that there are no limits or restrictions for what a person can or can't do. When you want to do something you just start doing it, because life is short and we may loose our chance while we are wondering when is the right time to begin. There is no more right time than the exact moment - now."
22553,False,"I remember seeing this movie for the first time when I was eight years old. My grandfather always showed this to us when we were younger. It became one of my favorite movies , not because of the story line , but what it meant to me in real life. I remember watching the beginning when Forrest had his legs braces, like me. I thought ""He is like me and I know how it is to be teased."" considering I have mild cerebral palsy this movie meant my life and how I can see others treat you different when you have ""special legs"". I learned from this movie just because you have special legs and you are not considered ""smart"" don't let that hold you back. It never did and I'am thankful for this movie. People need to understand just because you have a disability does not mean we are stupid. We can do many things."
22554,False,"actually this movie is one of my favorite movies. the story is amazing, breathtaking. and tom hanks is rocking it! every human on earth should watch this movie! the story shows us that no matter what we can still do big things as long as we believe. Forrest is an inspiration for so many. if you haven't seen this movie yet, let go everything and start watching. after you've seen the movie something is gonna change. go and watch! enjoy!!PS: tom hanks is great. the directors could record him as he sleeps and still he can win the Oscar! :Dit's a movie which has 6 Oscars! c'mon! what are you waiting for? watch!"
22555,False,"Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a simple man with a sweet heart. It's his journey through American history. His childhood friend Jenny (Robin Wright) would travel the underbelly flipside of the same world. His journey is heavily influenced by his mama (Sally Field), Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise), and Bubba Blue (Mykelti Williamson).Director Robert Zemeckis has added another chapter to the American mythos. It is a magical tale where the good guys win out. That you can rise to the top no matter what handicap you have. That a good heart will enlighten all it touches. It is a tale worthy of Frank Capra.If I could have a wish, it is a deeper meaning to Gump's journey. For example, he's given a chance to comment on the Vietnam war but the sound goes out of his mike. I would have like to hear what he had to say. But that might have been asking too much. More than anything, Gump is not controversial."
22556,False,"Never wrote a review before but every time I watched Forrest Gump I got the urge to do it.. This time I couldn't resist it and here I am sharing a few lines with you folks :) FG is one of my favourite movies. I think that if I had to choose a word to described this movie that would be LIFE. Forrest shows me how simple, beautiful and basic life is and how easy is to miss it and let it pass you by. The movie is very detailed and keeps you hooked in until the end. Towards the end though it touches you, puts a knott in your throat and even squeezes some tears out of you. I am sure I have absolutely nothing new to add but I wanted to show and share my appreciation for this wonderful and brilliant movie. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful ..."
22557,False,"""Mama always said that dyin' was a part of life. I sure wish it wasn't.""No matter what Tom Hanks does for the rest of his career, to me, he'll always be Forrest Gump. I mean that as a compliment. His role here was one of the best and most memorable that I've ever seen in a movie. I can't imagine another actor who could have played this character, and played him so well.Forrest's story will take you all across America, and beyond. You get to see a large part of recent American history through his eyes. It's extremely clever the way that Forrest's presence is weaved throughout so many iconic events and places. The man meets Presidents, inspires kings (of music), and lives the kind of life that most people would never even dream of. And he takes everyone watching along with him. Forrest Gump is so beloved, because it's so charming and heartbreaking and genuine. Even when it's at its most sentimental or sugary sweet, it's grounded in the kind of genuine human emotion that makes great movie experiences. You'll laugh and fight back tears, but you'll also think. This is one of the few movies that everyone should see, and that almost everyone will like. It's a classic in every sense of the word."
22558,False,"first of all, I've only seen this movie once, but I was actually very offended by it.  It takes itself far too seriously.  The commentary embedded in the film's core, relating to the 60s revolution and drug use in general, are shockingly naive, reactionary, and simple-minded.  This movie likes to think that if it can pass itself off as simple, it can pass of its truths as ""simple truths"" much like its foggy-headed main character.  Not so.  It's just simple, in a kind of idiotic way that makes us underestimate the complexities of our social history (speaking as a 23 year old, what do I know?, but I've been through a little bit) and come out with a shiny happy 90s answer to all these issues.  This movie is for people who voted for Reagan."
22559,False,"Whether you see this at face value as a loving look at a ""slow"" guy who makes good or as a comment on American, it still adds up to ""Americans are simple in the head"". Boy do they love a film that reflects this very wholesome American love of the ""common"" dullard. Forrest would actually be teased if not killed for being this dumb in the deep south but add a soundtrack of hits, catch phases, and Tom Hanks' bad 'tard impression and a tear jerker is born. Duh, ignorance is bliss."
22560,False,"This is one of the most ridiculous and over-hyped movies of all time, and the sole reason I stopped liking Tom Hanks as an actor. Ridiculous accents, too many special effects, unbelievable story. The high point is young Haley Joel Osment as Gump Jr, and it's only at the very end of the movie that we see him."
22561,False,"This is one of the worse movies I've ever seen. An insult to one's intelligence. Unbelievable and just plain moronic, I could barely watch. Tom Hanks was stiff and gave his worse performance ever. The directing was dreadful. Only a five year old could come close to believing any of this could ever happen. All the money spent on a turkey like this is shameful. And to think that it was actually successful is mind boggling. I was embarrassed watching it. The producers and director involved should have been barred from the industry for five years. The script should have been thrown away on half a reading. To suggest that a retarded person could play football is completely ignorant."
22562,False,"Everybody talks about how great this movie is.  Will someone tell me why? So a stupid guy wanders through the world, saying all kinds of stupid stuff, chasing a drug addicted stripper, and by blind luck wanders into millions of dollars?  Yeah, I can see why that's so popular.  It seems like this movie would make more sense as an inspirational video for retarded people.
Look!  You too can be a success without the unbearable burdens of intelligence or talent.  All it takes is ridiculous levels of luck.And what about the years of running?  Years of running?  What is that? It's just so ridiculous.  Who does that?  Who?  And people follow him?  ""I don't feel like running anymore.""  You're joking.  Who wrote this because they should really be crucified."
22563,False,"THis movie plain and simply was stupid. There were a couple of laughs here and there, but it was carried by the soundtrack. It was like ""dumb and dumber"" with better music. It tries to tackle every political and social issue over the past 50 years. It is a slap in the face to anybody who lived through those years to try and bundle them all together. It was not only corny but long, this movie is the reason that people smoke pot at the theater!"
22564,False,"I can't believe this insultingly stupid, trite, and flabby film was nominated for any awards. The film is simply meaningless, having no comprehensible point of view and unwilling to look one millimeter past the surface of any of the events it attempts to depict. Something like this is even more flatulent and offensive than action garbage like _ConAir_, which at least doesn't pretend to have Something To Say.The popularity of this movie escapes me completely. I guess it makes people feel good about themselves in some sick way: ""My life is bad, but lookie - this retarded man gets to interpret the highlights of American history and popular culture for me!"" Hanks, who I normally like, seems to have based his performance on not blinking, or maybe he was just drugged (a rational response to the uber Hallmark Card that passes for a screenplay.) Wretched garbage appropriate for people scared of thinking."
22565,False,"I'm an action movie guy. Primarily, I like it when things blow up. So to begin with, ""Forrest Gump"" was not going to be my kind of movie. But I like an intelligent film that has something to say, and I think I ""get it"" about this film. It's a journey through modern American history, showing a window into mainstream culture from the plight of the main character.Unfortunately, the film is incredibly sappy. Everybody who can possibly get hurt gets hurt. If it's a sunny day, it will start raining in this film. Then we get to linger on this melancholy in endless melodramatic scenes. Meanwhile Forrest, who is stupid as a stump (unlike brilliant actor Tom Hanks who plays him) is an anti-hero who lets others push him around. There's no deep theme, and the movie is sub-intellectual.These things built up into what is essentially an amateur script surrounded by a blockbuster hype and star cast. ""Forrest Gump"" is basically a soap opera, and I do mean to conjure images of daytime TV at its worst.Who should see this film:-- Soap opera fans-- Everybody else, run for the hills -- even if you do havean artistic film school depthI'll give ""Forrest Gump"" a 2 out of 10, because it at least maintained a consistent tone throughout. If you don't like the first ten minutes, stop watching."
22566,False,"The other nominees for Best Picture of 1994 were `Pulp Fiction', `Four Weddings and a Funeral', `The Shawshank Redemption' and `Quiz Show'.  ANY ONE of these would have been a deserving winner (my personal favourite was probably `Quiz Show').  Yet, of course, the award went to `Forrest Gump'.  I took this as a deep personal affront.  I took every undeserved success and wreath of flowers laid at the door of this miserable film as a personal affront.  It was a standing insult to my belief that `Forrest Gump' was just too stupid to succeed for very long.  Ah, well.  Life imitates art.Make no mistake: `Forrest Gump' is not just stupid but a hymn to stupidity, an extended celebration of stupidity as a virtue.  Gump is as innocent as they come and we're clearly meant to think that this is a good thing.  The trouble is that Gump has purchased his sainthood too cheaply.  He does not, for instance, display any real courage in the Vietnam War: he gives the appearance of courage only because he's too dumb to work out what's going on.  (If only a bomb had landed on his foot.  It would have knocked some of that insufferable self-assurance out of him, at the very least.)The film is just one big, long appeal to the Pope to have Forrest Gump canonised, and is about as bearable as any such appeal - and, as is so often the case, the subject of this appeal is someone you wouldn't want to spend five minutes with.`Forrest Gump' is one hundred and forty-two minutes long."
22567,False,"How did this ripoff of ""Being There"" ever get to be so loved?  People say it's proof that a decent, honest man can succeed despite lack of intelligence.  They're wrong.  The movie is proof that luck is everything: hope your friend invests all your money in Apple and not Atari; hope your shrimp boat is the only one out at sea when a storm breaks; hope that you don't die of shock when you're luckily shot in the buttocks and not in the back; hope you don't get AIDS from your wife.  This movie is also politically reactionary -- all who rebel against societal convention lose their legs, do drugs, beat their girlfriends, or die young.  In addition, the product placement in this film (Nike and Dr. Pepper) is shameless.  An emotionally manipulative film that is very, very empty."

22569,False,"Forrest Gump is a great tale of a unintelligent man. Tom Hanks does an great job in acting. He is truly awe inspiring. It is a story of sacrifice, love, friendship and honor. Gary Sinise and Robin Wright do great in their own supporting roles. The ending will bring a tear to the most serious moviegoer. Cinematography, writing and sound are all top notch. Director Robert Zemeckis does a great job with this film and it shows. This film deserves great praise and love. It teaches life lessons and is very moving to all. Anyone can find this movie wonderful and moving. It is a magical film and deserves all the respect it has been given. Anyone who is a film buff has to see this movie."
22570,False,"One would think you would have to be 5 years old to like this movie. Tom Hank's worse acting job ever. If you could call it an acting job. ""Dah, I'm a dumb guy, please have empathy for me."" This movie begs for your sympathy. But Forrest is a hollow shell, and as unbelievable as the inane plot. How can anyone like this movie. Your more likely to meet the Wizard of OZ in Emerald City than you are to meet an athlete like Forrest Gump. It's not possible and it's not funny to pretend that it is possible. How about a sequel where Gump becomes a heart throb movie actor? Or a brain doctor? Or how about an investment banker? It's not funny. It's not interesting. And poorly acted. Just plain stupid. Puke...And it made a lot of money. And is one of the most highly rated movies. Go figure."
22571,False,"When Tom Hanks won his first Oscar for Philadelphia in 1993 the film received a total of five nominations. His second Oscar for Forrest Gump came in a film that received more than double that in nominations and awards. If Forrest Gump did nothing else it solidified Hanks's credentials as a serious actor. He would never be doing imitations of his Bosom Buddies character in films again.It also among other awards also won for Best Picture and Best director for Robert Zemeckis, richly deserved. The film is Huckleberry Finn like in its canny observations coming from the man who had an IQ we are told of 75. But as Forrest also tells us, ""stupid is as stupid does"". And Forrest with the hand of an unseen providence comes out a lot better than some of the clever people he meets in life.Watching the film once again it occurred to me that Mark Twain if he couldn't have written this himself would have loved the way Zemeckis handled the character of Forrest Gump. The beauty of Huckleberry Finn and the secret of its success is that Twain got into the mind of a child who recorded all the events around him, a child without too much education. What Zemeckis did was get Hanks into a child like mind who sees things with amazing clarity stripped of any veneer of pretense. Which Hanks observes in the people around him and in the events that shape America and himself from Eisenhower to Reagan.There are two prominent female parts in Forrest Gump. One is for Robin Wright who plays the abused child Julie as an adult. She is Forrest's love and best friend and she takes a different path of life one she chose with more deliberation than Hanks. Their fates though eventually entwined are radically different. The second major female role is for another two time Oscar winner Sally Field who now is playing matronly parts, a far cry from Gidget and the Flying Nun. She gives Forrest the maxims he lives by and in a crisis they turn out to be more than sound bite clichés.Another award that Forrest Gump won is for Special Effects and an award it didn't win was for Gary Sinise in the role of Lieutenant Dan Taylor, Forrest's commanding officer in Vietnam. That's something that does not compute because the special effects were to show Gary Sinise as a double amputee with both legs lost in Vietnam.It's some amazing bit of work no doubt about it, but to honor it without Sinise whose performance really brings it off is ridiculous. Sinise is the educated one who curses the fate that happened to him, but in the end by just going with the flow he does prosper in the end. Sinise lost that year in Best Supporting Actor category to Martin Landau for Ed Wood, but I think Sinise's performance has had a more lasting impact.To those Americans who serve our country it certainly has. Gary Sinise has devoted a great deal of his life and earned treasure to bring entertainment to our overseas troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, wherever, becoming a successor to Bob Hope in that regard. He's gone further than that though, setting up foundations to help civilians in both countries and contributing to numerous charities dealing with war and its aftermath. Doing that in my humble opinion Gary Sinise has become one of the great Americans of our brand new millenia, a lot more than just an actor. He's forever now known as Lieutenant Dan.In the end though the film belongs to Tom Hanks who joined with Spencer Tracy as the only two male actors to win back to back Oscars for Best Actor. Hanks fascinates us and guides us through this film and when we're done we've seen something very special.If you don't believe me about how good Forrest Gump is, then watch it for a few minutes and see if you're not sucked in. Like Forrest's mama says, the film's like life which is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you'll get until you open it."""
22572,False,"What a load of sentimental nonsense, I mean really! How can we celebrate the unremarkable life of such a tragic simpleton? I've heard one misguided fool remark that this was a "" truly great film & that's why it won so many awards "". Well, if they presented awards for time wasting, mediocre, uninspired, brainless drivel then Forrest Gump would be the undisputed champion of the celluloid world! Everything about this equals cinematic dogs mess, from Robert Zemeckis sloppy, gormless direction to Alan Silvestri's soulless,largely grating musical score, not to mention Hanks hollow & irritating portrayal of a drooling,chocolate-offering,life advice-giving mental case. I, Big Ol'Alex Davies, found this film to be an insult to my superior intelligence & even my boyfriend, who has broader taste than I, thought of it as nothing more than sappy cat vomit."
22573,False,"Great CGI effects & a truly Oscar-worthy performance by Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan. Tom Hanks is a one-trick pony in this movie, how he got the Best Actor Oscar that year over Morgan Freeman was a crime. This movie is a pandering treacly love letter to the baby boom generation, with a barely concealed right-wing prejudice, beginning from Forrest's service in Vietnam all the way through to the ""resolution"" with Jenny at the end.With that said, though, it is hugely entertaining and an American movie through and through.  I found certain parts of this film exceedingly offensive, Zemeckis dumbs down this movie almost to the level of Gump himself . . .maybe that was the point he was trying to make.
Watch this film and ask yourself ""What is Robert Zemeckis saying about what makes a good American?"" Forrest seems to have made the ""right"" choices and been at the ""right place at the right time"" for the last 45 years. Those who are wrong according to the director's vision seem to pay a heavy price. So is Zemeckis saying that idiocy disguised as innocence and naivety is a patriotic, even AMERICAN quality?"
22574,False,"I remember the first three times that I watched this movie, I really enjoyed it.  Then I watched it with a classroom full of students and noticed when everyone was laughing.  Everyone was laughing at the same joke over and over again.  Hey look, it's a retard doing retarded things; let's laugh at him. Oh, and to make people not feel guilty about it we'll make Forrest's life materially comfortable.  That this movie won oscars is an affront to the shreds of decency that the Oscars have.  That this movie was passed off as touching is wrong.  I loved Dumb and Dumber, and I see why I am not offended by it:  it does not feign depth or decency.  Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks may have fooled us in 1994, but it's 7 years later, and still people don't see this movie for what it is."
22575,False,"I lived in China and in 1995 when I was still a high school student, I watched this movie for its reputation  won several Oscar. Honestly I felt bored when I was watching the movie that time because I could hardly understand the meaning of the movie and could hardly feel its beauty. At that time, only ""The Terminator"" kind of movies was able to attract me. After I watched it for the second time now after 11 years, I felt quite moved by almost all the elements this movie carries, the story, quotes, special effect, Tom Hank's perfect portray of Forrest Gump and most importantly, Forrest's deepest innate world. It's not easy to conclude what kind of person Gump is and what are the meanings and inspiration this fictitious character conveys to all the viewers. But I do have the strongest inspiration from this movie, that is, people can really get somewhere to achieve something not only because they have a lot of good qualities, more importantly, from what we see on Forrest Gump, because of not having a lot of bad qualities, or innate weakness of human beings, or various interferences around everybody. You can see all those bad qualities, weaknesses and interferences from the lives of Lt. Dan and Jenny who are normal or seemingly smart persons. On the contrary, Forrest is a person with low IQ and was thought of by many people as moron. Yes, Forrest is not smart and he knows it quite well. But for me, exactly because of his being not so smart, he doesn't have those bad things that other normal persons have that prevent them from achieving what Forrest was able to achieve. Those people have too many thoughts sometimes, or too much expectation, or too much depression in face of setbacks and all those things are actually interferences to the normal people that prevent them from staying focused for a long time. Now I should be looking at myself and asking myself, what kind of interferences I should remove from myself to really get somewhere. Thanks, Forrest Gump, thanks, this fabulous movie that sheds so much light on me."
22576,False,"Robert Zemeckis directed this movie, Forrest Gump, in 1994. It well maintained the theme from the original version of book, ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" and ""Stupid is as stupid does"" This movie contains a lot of great actors and actresses who could act their own characters very well and showed the theme or plot. The reason why this film became so popular is because this story isn't just for the certain period or certain people, but for everyone.The movie begins in the small fictional town in Alabama but soon; the setting of this movie goes on to the whole world. The setting also proves about the universal theme, ""Everyman"" All the important events happen between late 1950s to late1980s. This movie doesn't only affects about late 1950s to late1980s but the present time also. Such as white trash and people who have physical problems didn't live only between 1950s to 1980s but they still exist.There are several characters that strongly affect the theme or the plot of this movie. First of all, the surrealistic character, Forrest Gump who was acted by Tom Hanks well represented the theme and also well showed of physical problem of Forrest. His IQ was under 70 and he had a problem with his legs when he was young. When he became an adult, he was still prejudged by people based on his intelligence. However, later he becomes really famous and rich. This event doesn't really mean to show that Forrest Gump became a successful person, but the movie is trying to break a strong stereotype of people, by using Forrest Gump. Also, it is telling not to judge people's ability or characteristics by intelligence or physical abilities. Like his quote ""stupid is as stupid does."" Mrs. Gump, Sally Fields, the actress was actor playing the mother of Forrest shows the theme of strong determination of all mothers in the world. Even though only ten year older than the grown Forrest Gump, her acting was so realistic that the audience didn't realize her age. Jenny, who was acted by Robin Wright, showed the reality of dark side of Americans' life. In the movie Jenny was the ""white trash"" but she isn't the only who is showing the theme of American life but partly, but through L.T he is somehow showing it too. He's character was so realistic. A deep friendship is expressed through his characterization.Generally, there are six most interesting events that are happening in this movie. In my opinion, starting the movie by grown Forrest Gump talking about his childhood from the present time on the bench is a good idea. His first interesting event starts when he entered school. He had a hard time. On the school bus everyone seemed to avoid him or be as far away from him, only because of his physical appearance. But later, Jenny who didn't look about her appearance came to him and be friend. Other than this, there are three events that Forrest Gump becoming all famous and meeting the U.S president three times. With this event, the plot goes really high in audience interest and I'm sure that viewers loved these events. Lastly, there is one important event left, about Jenny and Forrest that went audience very pleased but not a real happy ending.I was very impressed with this movie, especially with the acting skills and the themes of this story. This is a film that everyone would like and feel empathy with all these characters. The plot also appeals to average and ordinary people. I recommend this movie to all people no matter how old they are."
22577,False,"I'm afraid that this film probably wouldn't have bothered me quite so much if it had been significantly shorter. I tend to forget boring, over-sentimental stuff if it isn't also seemingly interminable.It took me a long time after this film to be able to watch some of the better Tom Hanks films and actually appreciate them (The Green Mile, Philadelphia, Saving Private Ryan etc)As The Princess Bride was one of my all-time favourite films, I expected better of Robyn Wright, but no-one could have saved a film with such an inappropriate message"
22578,False,"This has to be one of the most over-rated films of all time. I expected the film to be stupid, which it was, but I didn't expect it to be incredibly boring also. I couldn't even get through the video in one night; I was so bored I had to stop watching it and finish it the next night. Its winning the Oscar for Best Picture crystallized the opinion that I had been forming for several years that the opinion of the Academy is pretty meaningless."
22579,False,"I decided to watch this movie today,and it made my whole day good. .The movie is extremely emotional and it seems as if I am watching several movies in a row. I simply don't have words to describe the role of Tom Hanks who is awarded with a Osacar.I would like to thank Robert Zemickis for making such a lovely movie......"
22580,False,"Without a doubt one of the greatest films ever to be shown on the silver screen and only solidified by a stellar performance by the cast and crew. One of the few films everyone can say they have at least seen once, this movie deserved every Oscar it won and will go down in history as one of the best and well-done films ever to be created. Many can say that this film does have some very minor issues, things such as the questionable moral depicted by the love interest, Jenny, throughout the course of the entire film. Some could take umbrage with the less-than amazing special effects (though the time of production should be added into context)."
22581,False,"Forrest Gump is Tom Hanks best performance, This is NOT up for debate. It's the most Unbelievable believable film i think i ever did see, I watch Tom Hanks and i don't see him the 'Actor' in this role i just see the character that is Forrest Gump and to me this is a testament to Mr Hanks greatness. Forrest Gump makes my top 5 list of the greatest films i have seen and i have seen a million or so. This is just one of them films of only a few they i can watch over and over and it be as great as it always was. Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks are great duo but this is there very best to date. Perhaps Forrest Gump may not be Hanks best film because i believe that title is The Green Mile, Tom Hanks as an actor was a generation best and still continues to be great."
22582,False,"I'm either the only person in the world who didn't get this movie, or the only one who did. When I saw it I figured the only way to evaluate it was as a variation on the great ""Being There""-a wicked satire. But then the mainstream reviews began pouring in and it became clear that people were taking this Charming Simpleton tripe seriously. Does anyone really believe that the same Robert Zemeckis who directed one of the most scathing, vicious comedies ever (""Used Cars"") has suddenly gone simple himself and meant this to be taken at face value? It's not a healthy sign when so many people seem to regard a mentally challenged individual as a role model for all to emulate."
22583,False,"All that money, all those clever effects, all those stars ... and for what? A mind-numbing stream of syrup with no discernible purpose except to fool very dull people into thinking they have seen an epic movie. Life is like a box of chocolates? No, but some movies are as sickly sweet."
22584,False,"Make a movie about a retard, or play one. Look at Hoffman in ""Rainman"" or Miles in ""Ryan's Daughter"", they won Oscars for playing retards too. You can't go wrong with a stupid person as the focus, sort of like the chimp lead. Better yet, endow him with all sorts of savant-like talents like superhuman strength and sports agility. What silly, contrived hokum. This is a sentimental piece of schlock that is always simple and forced. ""Life is like a box of chocolates"", yeah, right! The only one who deserved the Oscar lost, Gary Sinise. Finally, use cgi to work the retard into all the key TV/pop culture moments, guaranteed to melt a boomer's heart. Have him influence the whole world with his simple homespun Gomer Pyle platitudes. If the director had another 10 minutes to fill, Gump would have redesigned the Apollo space ship program and got the astronauts to the Moon. Enough sugar here to rot our whole country's teeth. It proves that pop culture really sucks. ""Pulp Fiction"" was it's dark Oscar nominated rival in 1994. It was a better movie with a sicker message so it lost to this treacle,"
22585,False,"""Forrest Gump"" professes to be all about innocence, but is certainly the most pernicious highly popular movie of my lifetime, whose subtext is the message that there is something virtuous about invincible ignorance, which will be rewarded in all sorts of improbable and arbitrary ways. An exercise from beginning to end in magical thinking, the movie undermines the manifest fact that achievements in life should and must be earned, and that understanding proceeds from knowledge, which must, in turn, be gained through education, the broader the better. ""Forrest Gump"" was the perfect vehicle for the reactionary Reagan era, with its ""what me worry"", feel-good-about-America message, regardless of what we were (and are) doing, and however much suffering we may countenance or cause (whether in Vietnam, Chile, Guatemala, El Salvador, Angola, or Iraq, then or now). The movie was also a major piece of propaganda in the then new revisionism regarding the Vietnam War that began under Reagan, depicting anti-war activists as the perfect fit for that most tenacious of ""urban legends"", the spat upon veteran (the only people who spat upon the veterans were the Johnson and Nixon regimes that put them in harm's way, and then dumped them on the streets without providing any transitional or sustained support before PTSD was fully acknowledged as a consequence of trauma in combat). This movie is also a perfect fit for the kind of know-nothing nativism expressed by the likes of Sarah Palin and the ""Tea Party"" movement, and thus a sad commentary on the present condition of life in America as well. It is not a ""Candide"" for our time."
22586,False,"Only saved from all-time worst status by a good soundtrack and Tom Hanks' best effort to turn a truly awful character into someone vaguely palatable.This movie is an insult to the audience, its own subject matter and to anyone operating on something higher than basic brain stem function.Oh, look at the funny retard - he's a moron but he has a simple wisdom that can redeem us all.  Fortune cookies are sophisticated when compared to the message of this film.  Ugh.It is a sad commentary on the Academy's milquetoast voting standards that Gump is not the worst film to ever win a Best Picture award."
22587,False,"This movie has several elements for success in the right place, and could have been a true classic.  Ultimately, however, it is undermined by its own thinly-veiled moralizing and its whitewashing of social institutions and history.  This confection has an inviting, sugary coating of the sweetness of love and the matters of the heart, but has at its center the preaching of the ""moral value"" of social conformity."
22588,False,"After all the hype and promotion, I was disappointed at the lack of content. The scenes of nudity and sexuality were unnecessary and made a film which could have been great an embarrassment for those of us who prefer to stay out of other folks' bedrooms.  The acting by Mr. Hanks, however, was superb. (The only reason I gave it a ""3"" instead of a ""1"")  He made me empathize with, and love, Forrest.  His portrayal of this gentle man was the bright spot in this fatally flawed movie."
22589,False,"I am an easy going movie watcher and I am easily entertained by movies on all levels like Die Hard, Scream, Beetlejuice, Titanic, NBK, Splash, Mary Poppins, etc. But I never understood what was so great about this movie. I didn't see any charm in it at all. The Pulp Fiction guys should have won the bulk of the oscars not this.I also agree with one of the comments above that it is easy to act retarded and that Tom Hanks wasn't great. Really Boring, I even watched it again just to make sure it was boring. Thumbs Down!!!!"
22590,False,"Well, if you are in the mood for a hollow ""feel good movie"" this will fit the bill. But if you are looking for substance, or a film that makes you think, this film will leave you knowing you can never get the time back you just spent watching this movie. The soundtrack probably causes movie-goers to connect to the film more than the flimsy plot.At the time this film was released, Hanks was perhaps the most sought after leading man. In some ways, it is as though the studios were on a quest to turn him into his generation's Jimmy Stewart. Hanks is a solid actor, and has acted in many excellent roles, but this is not one of them. But this film certainly helped launch the ""Bubba Gump Shrimp Company Restaurant"" found at tourist traps all across the United States. In many ways, that is this film's legacy - made for theater tourist looking for a vacation for the mind."
22591,False,"Why do people love this movie?  This movie is not only completely unrealistic, it's also boring.  Almost everyone I know who saw this movie and wasn't middle aged said they liked the movie but it was too long and kind of or too boring.  Does that make sense?  When looking back at this movie, did it really give you anything back?  This movie is illogical, stupid, pointless, and umm... like before I get too redundant, annoying.  I was hoping that Forrest Gump would die in the war or like get hit by a car when he was running.  That would have been hilarious and then this movie could have been up there with Toxic Avenger and Braindead.  And the Academy Awards are a joke.  They don't recognize really good movies usually, and I'm stil in shock that American Beauty won since it actually deserved an Oscar. I seriously think that Demolition Man or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was a better movie.  At least Wesley Snipes had a cool hairstyle.  Go rent a classic like Vanilla Ice's Cool as Ice or C.H.U.D...  Forrest Gump sucks and isn't he more like an anti hero?  I'd rather have Leatherface or the Toxic Avenger, but who doesn't root for them anyway?"
22592,False,"In 1994, a mega hit movie came out. Millions of people went to see it in theaters, and adored the lovable main character; Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump later received six academy awards (including best picture and actor), and was even ranked as one of the hundred best American films of all time by the AFI. I pose a question to you, the reader; is something wrong with me? Because Forrest Gump, in my eyes, is, possibly, one of the hundred WORST movies that I've ever seen. Forrest Gump boasts a FAIR performance by Tom Hanks, starring as the title role. That, perhaps, is the best part of this movie, and it was only par. In terms of the story, which could be the worst part of this movie, it is completely pointless. It may be entertaining to watch, but, in the end, it is two and a half hours of a retard (75 I.Q.) prospering in life. This could be a really great movie, but there was no struggle involved. Forrest Gump simply had life and all of his achievements come rushing towards him. Forrest Gump advertises the idea that you can just slide through life effortlessly; that is not true. All in all, Forrest Gump is just a big, overrated disappointment."
22593,False,"After I saw this movie I had only one thing in mind. Are we all so stupid that we don t want to be successful? So even a dummy is better than me? I don t think so folks. Life is hard and success is like lottery. As per Tom Hanks....what can I say??? He s perfect for the role. He really looks stupid. I ve never been a fan of Hanks, and after seeing the movies he played in, I m convinced I ll never be a fan. Anyway, the advice I get is: don t go to work every day, just run for days and someone will notice you and get you into the White House...That s not even fair, but it doesn t bother me, since it is really comic."
22594,False,"I read the book and saw the movie back in the 90s when both were out and popular. The book was wonderful. The movie was pure junk! All the darkly sad and darkly humorous parts of the book were completely chewed up and regurgitated into pablum for the masses, so that Forrest Gump the Movie would be the feel-good experience of the year. Which it was, apparently. The masses are stupid. If I was the author of this book, I'd be pi**ed at this movie.This review requires 10 lines, but if I were to write more, it would be to give too much of my valuable time to this crappy movie.But I want to warn intelligent viewers out there who might not have seen this clap-trap yet, to avoid it.So I will try to accomplish 10 lines via the return key.Do I have 10 lines yet?Edited 9/20/96 - adding 1 star to this; I've seen the worst movie ever made (Crash-1996) and it's a true 1-star; no movie deserves to be in the same class as Crash, therefore I am adding 1 star to all my previously rated 1- and 2-star flicks."
22595,False,I read the book before going to see the movie.the book was strange but it was ok.this however is a overrated movie with a highly predictable performance by Tom Hanks.this movie was both pointless and how it managed to defeat pulp fiction at the oscars well only the academy know that one.i hated this movie with a vengeance i saw this the same day as the fantastic The Lion King.After the highs of Disney came the Lows of Hanks.a truly pathetic movie.
22596,False,Tom Hanks is incredible in such an inspiration movie. Do not see this movie from the wrong angle. Never questioned the reality of this movie. Get the message from this movie. They're a lots! No overrated. This is quality imaginable movie that inspires people around the world. This is the fact that this movie is 4 and a half out of 5!
22597,False,"Absolutely awful concatenation of lachrymose sentimentality and right-wing politics.  I hated this movie with an intensity that cannot be measured. This was one of the most inward looking American movies to be seen in a long time.  Americans seem to believe that there is no other country outside ""Godzone"""
22598,False,"The first half of the film is OK, the second half one of the most tedious experiences imaginable.  Quite possibly the most overrated movie of all time.  ""Pulp Fiction"" was robbed for ""Best Picture.""  This is one of those films that people feel required to love because the main character is ""slow."""
22599,False,"The book is wonderfull, Winston Groom wrote a comic masterpiece but whoever adapted it for the film is a complete and utter hack. I could barely sit through the movie and when it was over I wanted my two hours back. My advice is read the book and don't ever see or think about the movie again."
22600,False,"Did I see the same movie as the rest of the world? I thought this movie was lousy. It couldn't have been less interesting. The only thing that got me was how they made Gary Sinise's legs disappear; and that was a momentary curiosity at best, an interesting f/x. That was very well done, no question about it.I am very sentimental, at least when it comes to movies; this movie didn't touch me at all. Tom Hanks was obnoxious, at best. Robin Wright Penn is miscast and I have yet to see her in a movie in which she should have been in. I love Sally Field but even she cannot rescue this for me.This may be the movie I dislike the most...the fact that it won Best Picture, Actor etc. makes me hate it even more, and usually I don't care what the Academy thinks since I question the whole thing to begin with."
22601,False,"I have seen this movie at least a dozen times - likely even more. For me, it is a top 5, and could easily be tied for #1 with the other 4!The beauty of the film is found in Forrest Gump's innocence and purity and the way he deals with adversities and others, especially being raised in a conservative, white-powered, pre-60s Alabama culture. He does not see color, race, intelligence or gender - partially thanks to the way his mother raised him and painted a simple picture of life analogies for him to understand everything. He somehow manages to retain that innocence through some very difficult times. As he is picked on as a child, as a Vietnam soldier then veteran, as a college graduate of the late Sixties, and as an adult struggling through friendships, love, death, money and life challenges. Anyone watching should be able to personally relate to some of the various periods and parts of Forrest's life. I would not be doing this review justice if I did not mention the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and detailed costumes that lent itself to making this film epic. It truly is a film that captures your attention and imagination and holds it for its entire length. I recently shared it with my kids, who, even after 20+ years, found it amazing to watch."
22602,False,"Watched Forrest Gump .... It's beautiful. It's just amazing. A concept very few movies have successfully stood up to....It's the story of a stupid person named Forrest Gump. But its not just a stupid comedy to be laughed at and forgotten. It makes you see the world through the eyes of the stupid completely innocent Forrest. You see death, the evils of war, corruption, jealousy, self righteousness, greed, wealth, frustration, success and the world. But you see all of it almost without reaction. Cause you see all of these through Gump's eyes, through the eyes of a stupid man child and his brain doesn't work like me and you, he is different.... That's what makes the movie so special....Ã°Å¸ËÅ  Talking about other stuff, they keep everything simple, no special effects nothing. Just plain old good music at the right time.... And I must say Tom Hanks just nailed it....This is definitely a #mustWatch for people of every age group.... At you in love? I suggest you watch it with her. No it's not a romantic drama...."
22603,False,"The movie Forrest Gump has become a well known movie all around the world. Tom Hanks, a very popular and well known actor, portrays the role of Forrest. Forrest Gump is a mentally handicapped man whose disability is not specified in the film. People try to degrade Forrest by calling him names. Whenever someone calls him stupid, his mother, who is played by Sally Field, tells him ""stupid is as stupid does"" which is something he continuously repeats during the film. Although he has a disability and is told by multiple people that he can't accomplish things, he ends up doing things that no one ever imagined that he could do. Graduating high school, going to college on a football scholarship, fighting in the Vietnam War, owning a very successful shrimp business, and meeting several different presidents are just a few of the things that Forrest accomplishes over the course of the movie. Jenny Curran, played by Robin Wright, first meets Forrest on the school bus when she allows him to sit with her. Jenny becomes Forrest's best friend and they then become inseparable, going everywhere and doing everything together. After they finish school, Jenny and Forrest eventually start to drift apart. Forrest serves in the Vietnam War and does countless other things with his life. Jenny's life seemingly goes in the opposite direction, she becomes apart of the ""hippie movement"" and gets involved in some things that she should not be involved in. Throughout the film Jenny makes occasional appearances in Forrest's life. Some of the things she says to Forrest when she sees him is enough to make anyone wonder ""what the heck is she thinking?"". Although there are plenty of other films in the world, this one is by far one of my favorites. With the story line and the different cinematic elements of it, including the feather falling and landing right beside him, this movie proves it is well put together and deserved to win the 6 Academy Awards it was nominated for, including Best Picture and Actor in a Leading Role."
22604,False,"Forrest Gump is a simple man from Alabama who lives an extra ordinary life.This is my highest rated film of all time. A movie that can be watched over and over. Tom Hanks becomes Forrest Gump. You never feel like you are watching an actor. He is superbly backed with stellar roles by Gary Sinise (Lt Dan Taylor) and Robin Wright (Jenny).The soundtrack to Forrest Gump is classic. As the story plays out it captures pivotal moments in American history. The cinematography is stunning, with the perfect track for every scene delivered by Creedence Clearwater Revival, Elvis Presley, Fleetwood Mac and the list goes on.The greatest film ever made."
22605,False,"but very smart! I think this made Tom Hanks one of the most popular actors of our times! Script is very interesting and his acting is, I do not know how to describe it, beyond fabulous! It is one of those films which stick with you from the first moment that you see it. After I watched it I went: It is the stupid that is so popular today in the movie theaters? But I did not take it too seriously.I glorify its fantastic acting, camera and sets this film was filmed in. Of course, I assume that 99 per cent of the population saw this film. If you are within those 1 per cent, you either do not like stupid people or you are stupid yourself ;) Just watch it!"
22606,False,"There aren't many movies that have penetrated the subconscious of the American zeitgeist as intensely as Gump, and it's not hard to see why. It's a film that deftly mixes nearly every genre into one epic tale, yet never shies away from the importance of small moments. But with this much love, cynicism and (some deserved) scorn aren't far behind: terms like ""on-the nose"" and ""syrupy sweet"" come to mind. But what's the advantage of this cynicism when it's so rewarding to just sit back and enjoy? At its core, Gump is pure Hollywood magic that deserves to be treasured. Essentially a biopic of a fictional character, Gump is first-person-perspective storytelling with a protagonist who sees much but perceives littleat least not in the same way we do. Swimming in historical fiction and even magical realism, he impacts American history: presidents are met, classic songs are heard, Vietnam wars are foughtyet Forrest's gaze is set on one thing: love. It's silly and whimsical, yet consistently surprising to see Forrest navigate through life with such sincerity and tenacity. Lest we neglect how technically impeccable the film is. The aesthetic is simplistic and gorgeous, and the effects (missing limbs, altered historical footage) are light years ahead of what they should be. But these things are rarely mentioned because they aren't the point. Zemeckis wants the movie to be the same as its hero: simple, random, sincere. Gump's unconditional love, overwhelming kindness, and naïve determination got him wherever he needed to be, and that journey leaves him and us in stitches, while never abandoning hope. Manipulative? Maybeor maybe it's just great filmmaking."
22607,False,"When I originally watched this with my mom 20 years ago, we both were pretty touched by the events of Forrest Gump's life and the way he handled things. So now, watching this in IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend, it's the same feelings all over again but now having some additional life experiences, one notices things one hadn't thought of before. Like how the first person who sits with Forrest on the park bench is so uninterested in his story she takes the wrong bus and admits it to him while the last one who sits with him doesn't take her scheduled one because she's so immersed in hearing about his life! Or how Jenny realizes how much she truly loves him despite the way she sometimes treated him. Robert Zemeckis truly made a very compelling picture. And Tom Hanks delivered a wonderful performance worthy of a second Oscar win. Nice humorous stuff involving Hanks mixed in real news footage of the various presidents. And great music soundtrack to mark the times they lived in. Oh, and I loved the supporting cast of Mykelti Williamson, Sally Field, Gary Sinise, and Robin Wright as Jenny. With all that said, I'll now just say that Forrest Gump is worth all the praise and adulation it has gotten over the years."
22608,False,"Forrest Gump is a simple man with a low I.Q. but good intentions. He is running through childhood with his best and only friend Jenny. His 'mama' teaches him the ways of life and leaves him to choose his destiny. Forrest joins the army for service in Vietnam, finding new friends called Dan and Bubba, he wins medals, creates a famous shrimp fishing fleet, inspires people to jog, starts a ping-pong craze, create the smiley, write bumper stickers and songs, donating to people and meeting the president several times. However, this is all irrelevant to Forrest who can only think of his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran. Who has messed up her life. Although in the end all he wants to prove is that anyone can love anyone. Written by aliw135:)"
22609,False,"Forrest Gump seems to be a movie that is either dearly loved or passionately torn down. It almost always generates discussion and is a cultural landmark in American cinema. I haven't yet gone in to a discussion like this, but should the moment arise, I will definitely defend it, as it is one of my all time favorites. The thing that always gets me is the innocence in which Forrest sees the world. He doesn't really know what he is doing or saying, yet to us he makes a huge difference in the world. On the other side of the coin, Jenny makes her own choices. Choices that lead to a complicated life and an ultimately predictable demise. Unlike other characters that seem to have a positive impact on Forrest's life, Jenny always seems to be the light in his life, despite being a completely dislikeable person at one point of the movie. Once again the naive Gump doesn't judge Jenny's bad decisions, as he still sees that lovely, but damaged young girl he met when he was a child.As far as the movie making goes, FG presents us with a career defining performance from Tom Hanks, as he handles the emotional conflicts very well in the movie. In a midst of strong supporting performances, for me Gary Sinise steals the show as Lieutanent Dan Taylor, a man whose changes in life end up being an inspiration. Zemeckis's directing is precise, and Roth's script is very involving: In the end though, I think Alan Silvestri's delicate score is what accounts for at least 50% of the movie's dramatic effect.1994 will always be a year I will fondly remember as a great cinematic year. It features 3 Jim Carrey comedies that cemented his place in movie history, one of the greatest animated movies of all time, and 3 best picture nominees that would become worshiped movies. Whether it's with Pulp Fiction's violent world, or Shawshank Redemption's gritty prison vision, or even the endearing drama story that is Forrest Gump, this is top notch cinema.Rating: 10/10"
22610,False,"I've never met anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before, and for that matter I've never seen a movie quite like ""Forrest Gump."" Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream.The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction, not the formulas of modern movies. Its hero, played by Tom Hanks, is a thoroughly decent man with an IQ of 75, who manages between the 1950s and the 1980s to become involved in every major event in American history. And he survives them all with only honesty and niceness as his shields.And yet this is not a heartwarming story about a mentally retarded man. That cubbyhole is much too small and limiting for Forrest Gump. The movie is more of a meditation on our times, as seen through the eyes of a man who lacks cynicism and takes things for exactly what they are. Watch him carefully and you will understand why some people are criticized for being ""too clever by half."" Forrest is clever by just exactly enough.Tom Hanks may be the only actor who could have played the role.I can't think of anyone else as Gump, after seeing how Hanks makes him into a person so dignified, so straight-ahead. The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths.Forrest is born to an Alabama boardinghouse owner (Sally Field) who tries to correct his posture by making him wear braces, but who never criticizes his mind. When Forrest is called ""stupid,"" his mother tells him, ""Stupid is as stupid does,"" and Forrest turns out to be incapable of doing anything less than profound. Also, when the braces finally fall from his legs, it turns out he can run like the wind.That's how he gets a college football scholarship, in a life story that eventually becomes a running gag about his good luck. Gump the football hero becomes Gump the Medal of Honor winner in Vietnam, and then Gump the Ping-Pong champion, Gump the shrimp boat captain, Gump the millionaire stockholder (he gets shares in a new ""fruit company"" named Apple Computer), and Gump the man who runs across America and then retraces his steps.It could be argued that with his IQ of 75 Forrest does not quite understand everything that happens to him. Not so. He understands everything he needs to know, and the rest, the movie suggests, is just surplus. He even understands everything that's important about love, although Jenny, the girl he falls in love with in grade school and never falls out of love with, tells him, ""Forrest, you don't know what love is."" She is a stripper by that time.The movie is ingenious in taking Forrest on his tour of recent American history. The director, Robert Zemeckis, is experienced with the magic that special effects can do (his credits include the ""Back To The Future"" movies and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit""), and here he uses computerized visual legerdemain to place Gump in historic situations with actual people.Forrest stands next to the schoolhouse door with George Wallace, he teaches Elvis how to swivel his hips, he visits the White House three times, he's on the Dick Cavett show with John Lennon, and in a sequence that will have you rubbing your eyes with its realism, he addresses a Vietnam-era peace rally on the Mall in Washington. Special effects are also used in creating the character of Forrest's Vietnam friend Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), a Ron Kovic type who quite convincingly loses his legs.Using carefully selected TV clips and dubbed voices, Zemeckis is able to create some hilarious moments, as when LBJ examines the wound in what Forrest describes as ""my butt-ox."" And the biggest laugh in the movie comes after Nixon inquires where Forrest is staying in Washington, and then recommends the Watergate. (That's not the laugh, just the setup.) As Forrest's life becomes a guided tour of straight-arrow America, Jenny (played by Robin Wright) goes on a parallel tour of the counterculture. She goes to California, of course, and drops out, tunes in, and turns on. She's into psychedelics and flower power, antiwar rallies and love- ins, drugs and needles. Eventually it becomes clear that between them Forrest and Jenny have covered all of the landmarks of our recent cultural history, and the accommodation they arrive at in the end is like a dream of reconciliation for our society. What a magical movie."
22611,False,"A well deserved Oscar movie. i have seen it many times. Tom Hanks has done a masterpiece. i m looking forward for more such acting and direction. As the movie starts the gravity starts. i have given it 10 stars for it's story and acting. Run man, Run ! I wish Indian movie directors also take risks to make such an epic movie. there must be a group who likes and appreciate these kind of movies based on true spirit. by the way, i liked the movie thoroughly specially the part of struggle and bravery. the best part is the way he tells his name. at the end i would like to add that this kind of movies you don't see often. it is not full of spicy contents but the movie is awesome."
22612,False,"I think Forrest Gump is the greatest movie ever! Tom Hanks did an amazing job of this hard role. I wasn't born when the movie came out but it will be my all time favorite! Some people think its just a stupid movie but all the fact and the places, people, and event he encountered was amazingly true. i quote this movie all the time, sometimes without knowing it. I am a high school student who just watched the movie for a class project and for this project we had to write a review.Forrest Gump is a beautiful film and definitely is the film that Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks are most known for. It's one of those rare movies that everyone has seen and just about everyone loves. It's a classic and it's not hard to see why. The movie takes on the simpleness of it's title character, Forrest Gump. It's not flashy, it's simple, and the simpleness is beautiful."
22613,False,"This is the only film for which I can use the word ""Beautiful"" without any hesitation. 6 Academy Awards, $677,387,716 in box office & 8.8 rating in IMDb combined don't say it all.Tom Hanks portrayed the role of Forest Gump more than perfectly. Other supporting actor and actresses weren't that memorable. But that's for the sake of the story. Robert Zemeckis probably taught us how to direct. Hanks & Zemeckis did the best job of their career.Film editing was flawless. They shot the film in different locations and every single one of them added a new level of greatness to the film. The musics weren't much noticeable. Also weren't the visual effects. Which is actually a big success, because I thought they didn't use any visual effect.The story is simple, plain and for some mysterious reason also sad. Forest Gump will teach you how to live life. Miracles and shits both happen for a definite reason. You'll find out what's your destiny is, but not before you fulfill it. Just float around like a feather and you'll be OK. Do what you feel like, don't do it for any other reason.p.s. Those who are criticizing, there're more to a film than just the story. And about the academy awards, open your mind."
22614,False,"I am not a big fan of the romance genre generally speaking because I get my romance in side-stories in other film types like sci-fi, action, adventure, fantasy etc. But when the movie is labeled ""romance"" as a main theme then I usually will not like it... most of the ""romance"" films are icky chick-flicks *ewe*! I usually need more to make the movie interesting. Forrest Gump is one of those rare romance films that I thoroughly enjoyed! All I can say is ""Jenny, you fool! The right man for you has been there the whole time for you and you simply do not want to admit it! Sure, He isn't that smart yet he's smarter than all the men you have dated combined! Go back to Forrest!"" And that's all I've got to say about that! 9.5/10"
22615,False,"That' s one of these movies which combine many different emotions - in one moment you are laughing, because of the great humour, and on the next moment you're sad and you're barely crying. The story is very real and honest, and on the other hand is the great performance of Tom Hanks. In my opinion that movie keeps you thinking long after it's over and you'll watch it again(I do that every single time when I see it at the TV). For me ""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time. It's incredible and should be seen by everyone - and every age. The movie has it all too,drama,comedy and it challenges societal norms as well - teach us how to be human! Really charming movie!"
22616,False,"as i said in the summary , i think forrest gump is the best film ever produced by Hollywood , it contain all the ingredients of a successful movie , the casting choice was good i think tom hanks did a very good job in it , the music was very good , but they more important it is the story of the film , i really loved it , forrest gump is they kind of movie that after you see it its make believe that you can do anything , be whatever you want despite the problems you have in your life , its really give HOPE and passion to continue in your life without fear of the upcoming , so if you are hopeless and having hard times now i really recommend this movie for you , you will really fell better after it ."
22617,False,"I was on the hunt for good classic movies when I came across this one. I asked a good friend of mine what she thought of it, since she had already seen it, and she said that is was ""cute"". I decided to give it a try and was shocked by how good it was. first of all, Tom Hanks is indeed a great actor- one of the greatest I know. The way he is able to keep that western accent for the whole movie.. It immediately added a few points of rating for me. Second of all, The Plot! It is so interesting and so amazingly educational, and it is also very well presented, I almost couldn't tell the real events- the ones that really did occur- from the ""fake"" ones.Now, this review is horrible, so please don't read it."
22618,False,"I am a big fan of Tom Hanks and I have enjoyed pretty much all of his movies over the years but it was a close call between this and the green mile but I think forest gump is my favorite Hanks film of all time.It's such a nice story that is told in a clever way making you feel like a child once again, the main character played by Hanks is lovable, you can't help but hope for the best for him and simply just want to reach out and tell him everything will be OK. The movie has a realistic feel even thought it's fictional but this is because of how it goes though real time events, the main reasons why I love this movie so much is because it's like reading a book the story line takes you to another time and other place and the only bad thing is when it ends and you bounce back to reality."
22619,False,"Tom Hanks, hands down, gives one of the best performances by any actor. Ever. Forrest Gump is such a compelling, historically based, dramatic and even light hearted film that I believe is the greatest film of all time. Gary Sinise, or Lt. Dan, definitely should have won for Best Supporting Actor. He plays a man with no legs for more than half of the movie and he is such a harrowing character at large. Moreover, Forrest Gump, undoubtedly, has some of the best lines in movie history (Run Forrest Run, Life is like a box of chocolates, etc), but the morality behind the film is incredible. Forrest Gump, when he runs across the country for literally no reason, is such an inspirational moment in the film. What I enjoy most about Forrest Gump is that he unwittingly gets caught up in some of the most key moments in the 20th century. Watergate, Kennedy, Civil Rights, Vietnam, Alabama Football - he's there. And because Forrest is such a simple man, these scenes are that much more captivating. An absolute 10/10, Forrest Gump, driven by the once-in-a-lifetime performance by Tom Hanks, followed by a forceful performance by Gary Sinise, is the greatest film in history in my opinion. If you haven't watched it, you are missing out big time. Myself, it is one of those few movies that never gets old. Fantastic every time."
22620,False,"I've watched many movies. And it would be really inappropriate to say this isn't the best movie ever. There have been some complaints about movie being too sentimental, but no. This movie is not too sentimental. It is an unforgettable ride, a story following the life of... well, you read the description. All I can say that this is one movie which gets more exciting every minute, leaving you questioning what will happen to Forrest Gump, brilliantly played by Tom Hanks in the role of a lifetime, in the next scene. The movie feature a lot of unforgettable characters and Zemeckis' directing is awesome. It's a movie that really set the bar for every drama that will be filmed in the future."
22621,False,"YEAR OF RELEASE: 1994 WRITERS: Winston Groom (novel) and Eric Roth (screenplay) DIRECTOR: Robert Zemeckis RUNTIME: 2 hours 22 minutesI haven't seen this film for about 7 years or so. Seeing it again I was reminded why this is one of my all-time favorite pictures.THE PLOT: Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump, a mildly retarded Alabaman who brushes shoulders with the key figures and events of the 50s through the early 80s. Due to hard work, focus and uncommon wisdom he is hugely successful at whatever he does (running, war hero, ping pong, shrimp fishing). Meanwhile, the one woman he loves in all the world, Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), flounders through life hopelessly trying to find fulfillment in the drug culture with all the wrong people.""Forrest Gump"" is hugely entertaining on every level. It's a drama that skillfully includes both lighter, comedic moments and serious, tragic elements. If you've never seen it, don't think for a second that this is some average romantic comedy or goofball comedy. Far from it. I don't watch the Acadamy Awards or give any credence to their judgment (""American Beauty,"" best picture? Please) but ""Forrest Gump"" is one instance where they were absolutely right in regard to the Best Picture award.Some have criticized the film as an imbecilic fantasy, arguing that a simpleton like Gump would never become successful. It's true that the picture exaggerates Forrest's successes and experiences, and in that sense it's not realistic, but the film plainly reveals WHY he experienced continued success throughout his life. We can all learn from these little gems of wisdom:-- Whatever your I.Q., zero in on the areas for which you have a real talent.-- Focus on those gifts and master them. In other words, don't be a jack of all trades. This is in line with the Russian proverb: ""If you chase 8 rabbits you'll catch none.""-- Mastering your talents will take HARD WORK (which explains why lazy people are never wealthy, unless they inherit it).-- Whatever you do, do it WITH ALL YOUR HEART.-- Love deeply and cultivate deep loyalties (e.g. Jenny, Bubba & Lt. Dan). Loyalty is underrated.-- Be patient and slow to judge (unless someone abuses another person).-- Allow others the freedom to choose and make mistakes, even if it seems like it takes forever for them to learn from them.-- If something or someone STINKS, reject it and stay away from it (remember the prostitute?).-- Keep your word.-- Pray and have FAITH.-- Keep a humble spirit no matter how successful or great you become.We can also learn lessons from Jenny: Trying to attain fulfillment through loose sex and foreign substances is a LOST cause. Recognize and embrace those who have your best interests in mind (i.e. those who truly love you and are loyal to you); stay away from people who use and abuse you.From Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise) we learn a potent lesson about struggling with God to find true peace, success and reconciliation. Dan's all-out fight with God on the shrimp boat in the storm is potent and REAL. The great men and women of the bible experienced intense struggles with God: Most of the book of Job shows Job arguing with the Almighty and wanting to put Him on trial for crimes against humanity (!!); When God finally answers him Job falls to his face in humility and reverence. Jacob fought with God all night; the next day the Lord changed his name to Israel, which means ""struggles with God"" (Genesis 32:22-30). Also, remember Jesus' struggle with God and His will in the Garden of Gethsemane?Another thing we can learn from Lt. Dan is that he was able to recognize a ""golden connection"" in Forrest. No one makes it alone, no one. They had help. Despite Forrest's lack of academic smarts, Dan recognized his wisdom and greatness; it attracted him and he respected it. Because of his link to Gump he became hugely successful. Remember: ""One day of favor is worth a lifetime of labor.""Late in the film you'll see Lt. Dan and his Asian fiancé at Gump's wedding. Note how Dan LOOKS at Forrest when they greet each other. Dan shows the utmost love and respect for Gump and is in utter awe of his simple-minded greatness. (This is great acting on Sinise's part).""Forrest Gump"" is a film gem to be RELISHED on many levels. Not only will you be incredibly entertained, you may learn a thing or two."
22622,False,"i just watched this movie for the first time, and i have wanted to for so long but never had the time. it ended about 2 minutes ago and i am balling. i went through half a dozen tissues and there are still tears on my cheeks. the message is so important and so real and so relevant. it's worth the 2 and a half hours to watch. it uses real life issues such as the Vietnam war to get people to look at these issues and there are so man amazing underling meanings and quotes, i now know why my friend has a quote from this movie tattooed on her arm, it is so impacting and real and i am not an easy crying and i am still crying as i write this review. it is a beautiful story, and i am not writing about anything that happens in the movie because even the slightest detail may ruin the movie because you need to learn about it as it happens as if YOU are the person he is talking to on the park bench. it is just so real, 10 years later it is still real and honest and important that everyone considering seeing this movie, and everyone who isn't, just go out and see this movie. now. go. it's on Netflix."
22623,False,"""Forrest Gump"" is the ultimate fad movie. It came out big in 1994 and created a cultural sensation. It was easy to get swept up in its panorama of American cultural history, and all of the iconic imagery in the film made it seem like it was saying something important. But all these years later, this treacly piece of rubbish is nearly intolerable.The film is full of easy sentiment and false emotion. It depicts one thing after another (the Kennedy assassination, Vietnam, Watergate, the AIDS crisis) that trigger automatic emotional responses in the audience, so that the filmmakers don't have to do any work of their own to make the material effective. But underneath the lesson in American history and the admittedly terrific soundtrack, I can't help but wonder what point the movie tries to make. Are we to applaud Forrest for his pluck and resiliency when the only reason for them is the fact that he's too simple minded to understand the things that happen to him? Are we supposed to emulate him? Is the message that we all make life too complicated, and that we all need to buckle down to the only things that really matter, like love of country, God and our dear ol' mama? If so, gag.Tom Hanks is a winning presence in the film, and if anyone was going to be able to carry this story along, I imagine he did just as good a job as anyone else would have. But the only character worth watching as far as I'm concerned is poor little Jenny, played valiantly by Robin Wright Penn, who comes closer than anyone to playing an actual human being, despite the film's tendency to chew her character up and spit her out.This movie is like a box of chocolates...too much of it and you'll be sick.Grade: C-"
22624,False,"For those of us who do not subscribe to the conservative, Mom's Apple Pie, American Dream twaddle that this film propagates (i.e. Most of the World) then this film is patronising and annoying at best, insidious and offensive at worst. Lets look at the main messages in this film shall we:1) Even if you are a simpleton, don't worry. Tow the line, do as you're told, don't question  war, injustice, corruption, exploitation etc and America will reward you. Remember, if you do want to say anything of worth, make sure the microphone isn't working. 2) Question authority and you will die of AIDS (but lets not mention Homo***uality)All in all a propaganda movie mourning the passing of the 1950's Anglo-White Middle Class America whose myth died with Eisenhower. ""Life is Like a Box of Chocolates""? No I don't think it is really is it?. And as for one reviewer comparing it to Schindler's List - you should be ashamed of yourself. I wonder how Forrest would have danced around the Holocaust? Probably thinks it's a caramel cup."
22625,False,"Quite simply, the greatest film ever made.Humour, sadness, action, drama and a Vietnam film all rolled into one.I'm not a stone cold, heartless villain, but it takes a lot to make me cry when I watch a movie. Bambi's mother, I couldn't care less. Jimmy Stewart in, ""Oh, what a wonderful life,"" - yeah right! The Lion King, when Mufasa bites the big one - on the verge.But seriously - I bawled my big brown eyes out, on several occasions in this film. A real tear-jerker, and a wonderful character, played to perfection by Tom Hanks. Every bit as worthy for the Oscar as Rooney was to win the Premiership in 2007.I cannot say it enough: This is THE film of all time. Watch it, and you'll see."
22626,False,"This is the first review I've written in my whole life. Motivation? First of all - this is a superior movie, secondly - some bad reviews I've read about it. Also if there's something to take from this movie, then it's good by default. And Forrest Gump has prepared quite a lot for you.I love it because it shows the so much of human nature like love, trust, persistence, loyalty and so on. But most important, it teaches to do the right thing. Once you learn to do the right thing, good things start happening to you. What few movies have is the effect of ""once the movie starts, you start living it"". This movie sucks you in and if you're a human being it leaves traces in your soul. Few movies can do that. To oppose some of the reviewers. If you have rated this movie low, let me tell you something. You most probably haven't got the message of it. It's not a documentary you know. There's more to it and if you will eventually get the message, then it might help you in quite a ways. My advice to you - don't be too proud.I would really recommend Forrest Gump movie to everyone. If you've seen it - watch it again. Positive emotions guaranteed. Cheers!"
22627,False,"Ever have that one film that you've been getting bothered to watch, and just because you haven't seen it people feel the need to hate you and bash you? Or maybe it's just me. Forrest Gump has been neglected by me for years on end. Sadly, I can not give a reason strong enough for people to understand. It's something only I understand.My reason is that sometimes I get so sick and tired of hearing so much about one film I just blow it off and pick around the edges. It gets annoying to hear the same thing being spoken over and over again, and when I say some of my favorite films are Clerks, Tremors, License to Drive, Joy Ride, and Bio-Dome people, the ones that have heard of the above, say I have a very eclectic taste in film. That I do. But when people started verbally insulting me saying ""I'm not a real critic"" and ""You can't call yourself a critic if you haven't seen the masterpiece that is Forrest Gump, I finally just said ""OK! I'll watch it!"" The plot I won't waste time repeating. Aside from me till this day EVERYONE knows the plot of Forrest Gump. So why repeat it? A simpleton with an IQ of 75 (Hanks) describes his life in an autobiographical form to strangers while waiting for a bus. Can't get more simplistic than that.Forrest Gump has been called by people ""a masterpiece"" and ""a classic."" While I think it's a well made film, I don't think it deserved six Oscars. I also don't think I should be ridiculed and slapped in the face for not seeing this film. It wasn't truly amazing. In fact, no film is really ""amazing."" Even the favorite film I don't call amazing. When defining ""amazing"" you'll find it's definition is ""surprising greatly."" I've seen actors, directors, people, teachers, etc do an ""amazing"" job teaching. The film I'm waiting to define ""amazing"" has not been found.The Oscars Gump won were Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Effects, and Best Film Editing. It deserved Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Editing. That's about it. Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Shawshank Redemption, Quiz Show were all nominated for Best Picture in the year 1994. I can tell you right now I liked Shawshank better than Gump.As for the rest, Director Robert Zemeckis did a great job adapting the story onto film. Tom Hanks is rightfully the only person who could play Forrest with true affection. I respect that. Hanks is now attached to so many things like Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code I think ""Will he ever make a film worth seeing again?"" One category Forrest Gump should've won for is ""Best Musical Score."" The film includes the catchiest, most enjoyable score I can remember in a film. It's definitely on my list of faves (and my iPod for that matter). I found myself jamming out to the tunes in this movie. Especially Lynyrd Skynyrd's iconic ""Free Bird"" which was used to perfection in this film.Forrest Gump, the character, is very likable because of his mild mannered and innocent ways. I enjoyed the scenes of him in the army, and the scenes of him at the end. He is definitely a very memorable character. Not an amazing character.My final thoughts on ""the greatest movie ever"" go as followed; it was a damn fine film with very memorable moments, but is NOT the greatest film to ever be filmed, put in theaters, thrown in a case, set on the shelves. I somehow feel if I was not pressured and annoyed to review this film I would've enjoyed it more. Maybe if people didn't annoy me so much to review it I would've enjoyed more of what it had to offer. The damage is done. I bet even after I'm done with this review people will say I didn't do it appropriate justice. I got two words to say for them; s**t happens.Starring: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, and Sally Field. Directed by: Robert Zemeckis."
22628,False,"Forrest Gump is a bad, bad movie.  It is an idiot going around falling backwards into heroism, fortune, and friendship in a very unrealistic fashion.  It has no importance to society whatsoever. It adds nothing to one's personal enlightenment and does not make you think in the least.  I suppose it is supposed to be a ""feel good"" film but it is too long and boring to be that.  The fact that it has gotten so much praise notwithstanding  winning Best Picture just makes me hate this film even more.  If it is a feel good movie, let it be a feel good movie, but don't try to pass it off as some monument of film making and give it the same award as Schindler's List received and Saving Private Ryan got screwed out of.  This movie is as retarded as Forrest himself is."
22629,False,"...but the USA can make you rich, healthy and famous with the minimum trouble to make this a pure Hollywood movie. Should I say that this movie, though cast is okay and directing conventional, is much overrated. This movie seems made for a religious and puritan American audience, and it received here in France a particularily mixed opinion. Script has to my mind many flaws, music is irritating, and again I completely disapprove the meaning... so watch it (once only) if you have time and make yourself an opinion but don't think you are going to watch a wonder just because of its 6 academy awards! 6/10"
22630,False,"I just didnt like this film, I found it unbelievable that a retarded guy could do this much....cmon! pah-leese!this movie is weak... period"
22631,False,"Typical Tom Hanks vehicle that should never have rolled out of the garage. A mixture of yokel and idiot savant, Hanks is as bland as ever in this role. Gurk gurk gurk. The best parts of this film are the supporting actors. Hanks should go back to his bachelor party.Life is like a box of chocolates, and these ones have gone off..."
22632,False,"This movie is okay, but seriously folks, come on...... It's not that good. It sure as hell didn't deserve the academy awards. Forrest Gump and Titanic are the two (in my opinion, and hey, that's all it is) most overrated movies ever made. Ever!!!"
22633,False,"The thing that really spoils my enjoyment of this film is the way history is re-written.Not ancient history, but history which I lived through. In real-life the anti-war protesters were venting their disapproval of what they earnestly felt was an immoral war. They took a lot of knocks from the powers that be for their troubles as well.This movie depicts them as shallow, selfish, manipulative, power-driven, and even violent people (there's irony for you!) who were ""Unamerican"" in every sense of the word.The odious message of this movie is that ignorance is bliss. Don't think about things and everything will work out nicely and you will be happy. Well at least you'll get rich - which in most American movies is close enough.It's enough to make a person gag.Oh, and the fact it beat Pulp Fiction and Shawshank Redemption to the best picture Oscar doesn't help either."
22634,False,"The first time I saw Forrest Gump, I loved it. On the second time around, I saw how terrible it actually is. There is not as much a plot as an idea. It's like watching ""Look who's talking"", where the writers thought that simply having a baby talk was plot enough to fill a hour and a half.You all know the premise of this movie. The life of a retarded man in 20th century America. He does a lot of unusual things, which all turn out ok and trigger key historical events. This is funny. Then the writers see that two hours have passed, and have to conjure an ending. They kill off Forrest's wife and have Forrest give a tearjerking speech like only Tom Hanks can. This is uplifting. There. Now go home and feel good.Some of my friends saw the film as plain all-american propaganda. In my opinion however, the film doesn't really take itself seriously enough to just be a vehicle for the American dream. In fact, Forrest Gump could have been a biting satire. As the audience is clearly supposed to laugh at Forrest's improbable success, the film could be seen as a parody. Mostly all the humour comes from the fact that the audience knows that the events are the exact opposite of what would happen in reality. The filmmakers could even have argued that recent history is so insane, that the events could as well have been caused by someone like Mr. Gump. The movie, however, doesn't have the guts to have lean to the right or left. Forrest's pivotal role in history is treated as a mere light-hearted gimmick, omitting all the possibilities for actual commentary.The film tries to have it both ways in many other scenes as well. Apparently it´s not PC to bully Forrest, but on the other hand the audience is supposed to laugh at his antics. Forrest as both a war hero and a peace advocate exemplifies this problem. This isn't being ironic, impartial or open to interpretation. Especially concerning the Vietnam war, the writers have obviously not wanted to offend anyone, now matter how derivative it will look. In the end, it only comes off as having nothing to say."
22635,False,"There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend. Those who dig Forrest Gump, and those who don't. I don't. If ""Forrest Gump"" is truly viewed as some kind of inspirational cinematic experience, then America is in a lot of trouble. Forrest Gump is no masterpiece of cinema, not even by a long-shot. It is largely a formulated overly sentimental contrivance that simply plays too well into American saccharine tastes, mostly pop melodrama for the sake of pop melodrama. This was obviously made for the same audience that likes ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""Lucky You"".Certainly, I don't have a problem with the idea of a feeble-minded main character from which to tell a story. (""Rain Man"", a similar idea, is a far superior story to and much more real than the silliness of ""Gump"".) I will concede Hanks' portrayal of Forrest is no less than brilliant, and he was deserving of the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1994. But was this film really deserving of Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Writing? Is this film really in the same league as ""Schindler's List"", ""Ghandhi"", ""The Hurt Locker"", and ""Platoon""? I don't think so. A contrived stooge, a late 20th century throw-back to Lenny of ""Of Mice and Men"" (""Tell me about the rabbits, George""), enmeshed in a series of sentimentalized vignettes is nothing more than contrived farce. Does Gump represent the American ideal or fictionalized empty-headed-ness? Forrest Gump only mirrors American's insatiable appetite for the overly sentimental. Instead of telling a true human story, such as ""Rain Man"", about the struggles of a man verging on feeble-mindedness, the filmmakers decided to sentimentalize him and put him into the most ridiculous and unbelievable of situations. Because of the fantastical nature of the entire story, I think ""Gump"" does a disservice to those with intellectual disabilities, although I will admit it does so inadvertently. ""Rain Man"" I think achieves quite the opposite.So many of the scenes in this movie made no sense. In the opening sequence when young Forrest's legs are in braces and, inspired by the ""girl next door"", he begins running down a Midwest dirt road, and his braces magically come off. Oh brother. Only Hollywood could imagine something that rings of a bad ""Saturday Evening Post"" illustration from the 1950's. Not even Norman Rockwell would have painted something quite so contrived. Of course the ""running theme"" will recur toward the end of the the film. Later, despite his feeble-mindedness, he's drafted into the army where he puts his rifle together faster and better than anyone in training. He's a feeble-minded genius. Maybe an idiot-savant?During the course of much of the film, Gump ends up involved in the most unlikely of situations. He plays football under a legendary college coach, goes to Vietnam, wins a congressional medal, meets John F Kennedy, becomes a ping-pong champion, meets John Lennon, informs on the Watergate burglars, and ends up investing his ping-pong winnings into the Apple Computer company. And then goes on a pointless ""run"" where all these people run after him. Or maybe this last part is realistic. Not about Forrest running but that people would follow. Obviously everybody followed Gump to the box office. And then to the Academy Awards. It's a wonder the filmmakers didn't have him take the next logical step and have him run for president. Raymond Babbitt (the autistic character from ""Rain Man"" played by Dustin Hoffman) could be his running mate.The only saving grace of the film is some of the Vietnam sequences, and his relationship with Lut. Dan played by Gary Sinese, who is the other standout talent of the film. Gump's tour of duty and his relationship with Dan were far more substantive than all the rest of the movie put together. I think it would have been far more interesting and insightful if the story was about a feeble-minded man forced to fight in Vietnam rather than adding all the other asinine episodes that made me say to myself, ""Oh come on..."" And I liked aspects of Gump's relationship with Dan, and I wished that had been more developed rather than Gump popping up in high spots of American history. When Gump reports the Watergate burglary, I just about lost my popcorn.The recurring theme of ""Gump"" is ""life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."". As I have never liked most of the candies in those boxes (I always end up with the slimy gooey ones), I guess I am not the right viewer to appreciate the wonders of ""Forrest Gump"". I typically avoid those boxes of candies just for that reason. I want something that has a little more meat to it, a little more realism, and a little more honesty. Not just gooey caramel. Whoever wrote Forrest Gump was eating a box of these candies and decided to make a movie about it. The problem with those box of chocolates is that you know exactly what you're going to get and that's why I avoid them."
22636,False,"This is the ultimate movie. It contains within it all of humanity and human history, wrapped around one special guy: Forrest Gump. Gump is clueless to this fact, he is just looking at the moment or forward, and in the process he changes history and fates of humans around him to the better.I recall no other movie that has satisfied me as a human in such way as this, in both drama, comic and thrill, with a manuscript that seems god-made in it's completeliness.Only a few other movies ever made, can get close to Forrest Gump, if you ask me!"
22637,False,"I had heard a lot about this film before I actually saw it, and the idea of a man unwittingly being present at the biggest moments of four decades seemed funny and entertaining enough. But I was heavily disappointed.What Forrest Gump lacks most is a stringent storytelling. The movie just doesn´t get off the ground. It isn´t the fault of the actors in general and certainly not of Tom Hanks, who gives a brilliant storyteller and doesn´t make pure slapstick out of the dimwitted Forrest - the actors are doing fine jobs. It´s the fault of the filmmakers. Lots of shots and even whole motives are plainly useless, not even in adding atmosphere, a lot of plot turns vanish into nothingness. The touching moments are soaked in corny music and lose their emotional potential, the technically great TV montages get less entertaining every time because they are wasted in bad punchlines. The whole dialogue is highly predictable. The reenactment of the Hippie movement is quite sound, and details like the Watergate joke are good laughs, but the scenes in between are painfully slow, at the end even simply boring. About a thousand times you are led to believe that there is a deeper moral than ""enjoy your life with the things you can do really good"" (this being introduced at the very beginning), but it isn´t. I don´t know what, except for the few gags that really function, could earn this movie the triumph that it had and still has. Watch ""Hair"" for the Sixties and ""Harold and Maude"" for the moral, you will be better off."
22638,False,"Screen favorite Tom Hanks proves that even the most unlikely soul can change the world in the award-winning 1994 blockbuster ""Forrest Gump"". The movie chronicles the life of Forrest Gump (Hanks), a slow-witted but good-hearted Alabama man who has been present during significant historic events in the 20th century. In his life, Forrest Gump has been an All-American football star, a Vietnam War hero, a champion Ping-Pong player, a successful fishing tycoon and an inspiration for a whole generation. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future), ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkably uplifting smash hit that ranks as one of the best films of the 1990s. Tom Hanks delivers his most entertaining acting performance. ""Forrest Gump"" features an unforgettable story, great special effects and terrific performances by Robin Wright, Gary Sinise and Sally Field. The 142-minute blockbuster opened with overwhelming positive reviews, grossed over $650 million worldwide and earned six Academy Award wins including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor. ""Forrest Gump"" Collector's Edition is an absolute must-have for any DVD collection. The 1994 blockbuster is presented is its theatrical 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The 2-Disc DVD contains an enjoyably well-defined video transfer and an excellent 5.1 Dolby digital sound. Its supplemental extras include two detailed audio commentaries by director Robert Zemeckis and crew, the 30-minute ""Through the Eyes of Forrest Gump"" documentary, behind-the-scenes and visual effects featurettes, trailers and picture gallery. Overall, ""Forrest Gump"" scores a winning ""A""."
22639,False,"Yes, I watched in awe as Tom Hanks was digitally inserted into all the major events of the second half of the twentieth century, but my already opened jaw then went slack at the banality of the screenplay.Sorry, but ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" is not a philosophy for a grownup. Or even a retard.I loved the opening shot, and was really wanting to like this film, but Sally Field is embarrassing, ditto Tom Hanks. Gary Sinise is good, but Robin Wright's character makes no sense.There IS no moral or philosophical coherence to this film ... it just allows woolly thinkers around the world to project their own feel good mantras onto it.I give it a 5 for technical achievement(I stand by for the usual tirade of illiterate and obscene abuse I get when I dare to criticise a sacred cow.)"
22640,False,"I am surprised that `Forrest Gump' made it on the 1997 AFI list of the 100 best American films. My only explanation is that had the virtue of being a recent film. It is memorable, no doubt, but it doesn't fit together.When I first saw the film, I didn't understand the Black Panthers or even the specifics of the Vietnam War. Ultimately I was lost at some places. Now I understand the history, and my stomach turns at the thought of squeezing forty years of history into a two and a half hour film; it didn't work. Digressing, I am shocked by how disgustingly idiotic the character is portrayed, under the guise of a 75 IQ. I'm no expert, but I don't see someone with that IQ dropping his pants or letting himself be hit by rocks. Frankly, the rural areas of the South where young Gump grew up didn't yield rocket scientists. This is because common sense was taught instead of the abstract reasoning of the Weschler IQ scorer. Just because a person cannot recite ten numbers backwards doesn't mean that they will drop their pants on TV.I'm lingering on this because it annoys me due to my elementary knowledge of these facts which were overlooked in the plot of the film. In the 1979 film `Being There', Peter Sellers plays Chance, a gardener with a mind similar to Forrest Gump; even a little simpler. However, his character never left the house where he was born and learned everything from television.Next up on the docket, Vietnam. Vietnam was not funny, nor is its interpretation through the eyes of Private Gump. I don't like heavy-handed Vietnam films like `Platoon' or `Apocalypse Now', and this film is more accurate, visually; so I hear. As for the aftermath, Lieutenant Dan's post-war trauma so closely models that of Jon Voight's character in `Coming Home' that I would sue for copyright infringement.The acting has ups and downs. Gary Senise is excellent as Lieutenant Dan. Robin Wright's dime-a-dozen performance makes me want to throw up. Sally Field is good in her few scenes. Star Tom Hanks is overrated and, frankly, not deserving of that golden statuette. As for the film's Best Picture Oscar, I can only conclude that the judges knew they would be lynched by angry mothers, old people, and arch-conservatives if they selected the ultra-controversial, though much better, film `Pulp Fiction'.`Forrest Gump' has highlights however. The bus stop bench as a forum was a fresh idea. The Bubba-Gump Shrimp section is hilarious. And the too-little-too-late drama at the end of the film sticks with you.Make your own decision, I'm playing it safe with a 5/10."
22641,False,"This is a ""cute"" movie. Tom Hanks is cute. The video clips are cute, to say nothing of technologically advanced. Let's face it, this guy Gump knew everyone, met everyone, and did everything, and there are pictures to prove it. He was a hero and a Medal of Honor winner and he took care of his slutty girl-friend who had sex so often with so many different people that she got this disease no one even had a name for back then, but he just wanted to marry her anyway. On top of that, he was warm-hearted and sweet and a warm and fuzzy human being. So what if he was a ""dull normal"" in IQ terms? He triumphed over all the egg-heads and nerds, and you, Joe Six-Pack and your brainless children, you too can triumph over them by being a mediocre, slow, plodding, non-comprehending, low-IQ individual. You will win in this technologically cut-throat world-wide competitive market by being nice. The meek will inherit the earth. Take that Bill Gates!"
22642,False,"After becoming increasingly disenchanted throughout this seemingly endless film, I began to wonder what the message, if any, was. It appeared to me that the theme was that it didn't matter if you were an idiot, things would work out fine so long as you are American and your hearts is pure. Some time after seeing the movie I read extracts from the original book which was clearly of more satirical intent. Forrest Gump is a modern day Candide living out a pseudo-panglossian idyll where everything works out for the best (in this best of all possible worlds.) While the book clearly highlights the absurdity of this, the movie takes a superficial view that illustrates the situations without any apparent understanding of irony."
22643,False,This movie has nothing to offer film-goers apart from pollyannic melodrama. Not one emotion or character has any depth or believability. I scanned the list of other efforts by this director and found nothing of merit there either. I've offered more words than this drivel deserves but this site requires 10 lines of text. I will fulfill the minimum. This movie has nothing to offer film-goers apart from pollyannic melodrama. Not one emotion or character has any depth or believability.

I will fulfill the minimum.
22644,False,This is one of the dumbest films I've ever seen. Tom Hanks is horrible. The premise is ridiculous. To think there was millions spent on this bunk shows how bad people's taste can be. First of all you'll never meet a person that mentally disadvantaged that can play football to any degree of excellence. This is Hollywood at it's worse.
22645,False,"I waited until I had seen this film for the second time, before making a judgement.  My initial reaction was correct it is one of the worst films I have ever seen, only Bean was worst.  The film fails everywhere apart from the acting.  The script, locations some appalling dialogue and dreadful sentimentality, that must be lost on a non-US audience. Absolutely awful 1/10"
22646,False,"To tell the truth,I don't agree with certain views expressed in this movie and I thought the characters were stereotypical.I have to admit Tom Hanks is a great actor but this is not his best movie.That honour goes to The Green Mile.But Forrest Gump was an overrated movie because it won the best picture oscar among excellent and intelligent movies like The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction.I thought the movie dragged on and the only high point of the movie was Tom Hanks' excellent portrayal of Forrest Gump.You can watch this movie once,not more than that."
22647,False,"The film ""Forrest Gump  is about a simple man's journey through complicated times. Forrest is played with the grace of a tightrope walker by Tom Hanks. He (Gump) is mildly retarded; he has an IQ of 75 at the movie's start and stays pretty much on that level all the way through. His trove of facts increases, but his basic methodology of handling the world never changes. As a boy, with braces on his legs, he peers at life and expects little more than to be heard and acknowledged, and the first person aside from his doting mother to do that with him is his lifelong love, Jenny (Robin Wright). Then one day the braces come off, more or less by accident, and Forrest discovers he can run like hell. He couples that with advice from Jenny (that the best thing to do when you're in trouble is just run) and this becomes the big asset that gets him through college on a football scholarship. And the one thing that gets him through Vietnam, allowing him to save most of his platoon and receive the Congressional Medal of Honor. Although he rescues his platoon leader (Gary Sinise), the man has nothing but rancor and bitterness, since he lost his legs, while Gump only got shot in the rear. After Vietnam, Gump goes on to be the captain of a shrimp boat, a Ping-Pong champion, a multi-millionaire, and a cross-country runner. The sly thing about the movie is the way he just sort of backs into everything, doing what comes naturally, and is even happy when nothing happens. All he wants out of life is the love of a woman, even."
22648,False,"Some movies are not to be rated because those are the movies which defines movies. Entire story of movie is summarized in this one line which tom hanks says simply somewhere in middle of movie. ""I am not the smart man. But I know what love is.""Tom hanks at its best of all performance. Not stupid but less smart than others. He is best in everything but he never do anything for himself. He proves to be a best son, best soldier, best sportsman, best shrimper, best runner, best father and at all times, a true lover. Tom will give his best in everything while maintaining his simplicity and innocence which gives you a smile every time with moisture in eyes. One of the rare movie which can make you smile and cry at same time.Nothing needs to be said for this movie. Oscar defines it all. Don't care about ratings and watch this masterpiece."
22649,False,"This is one of my favorite movies that I've ever seen. It's heartwarming, beautiful, charming, funny, and just overall great. The acting is superb, the story is excellent, and music is probably the best I've ever heard. Mostly because of the genius song selection for this movie. Every single song in this movie that you will hear(not including the original score)will perfectly some up the 50's - 90's era.A great thing about this movie is that the story centers around historic events like Vietnam, Watergate, and even includes famous people like JFK, LBJ, Elvis, and John Lennon. The movie perfectly captures these famous moments and people through the eyes Forrest Gump who simply was at the right place at the right time.Forrest Gump is an innocent tale about an innocent, loving man who gets sucked into America's history from the 1950's - 1990's. While going through these important moments of America's history, he is also trying to be with the woman he loves, Jenny. Jenny is an interesting character because her actions and her life are the exact opposite of Forrest's. Forrest is a person who wouldn't hurt a fly. He manages his life well, works hard, and has family values which make him a great person and therefore,the audience can easily fall in love with him. Jenny on other hand, is a person who can't seem to live her life. As a child she was abused by her father, she got kicked of college for appearing in a Playboy magazine, and her dream of becoming a country singer is pretty much destroyed because in the 70's she started taking drugs and the entire time she's being used or abused by every man that she meets, except Forrest.Thats the beauty of the film. You want these two to get together. You're rooting for the characters. And that's something hard to find in movies.Forrest Gump still stands the test of time even though it's already 15 years old. It's a classic movie that I enjoy watching whenever it's on TV. It offers a great story complete with great acting. If you haven't seen this movie yet, then what the hell are you doing? Go watch it, I guarantee you won't be disappointed.10/10 A+ all the way"
22650,False,"gonna keep this short cos' I could write about this movie all day, there's just so much to talk about! an amazing film that tells an amazing story about an amazing man, forrest gump has got it all: a brilliant cast, a wonderful score, arguably the best soundtrack of all time, and so many emotional highs and lows.great special effects too, and the Vietnam section is better than 99% of the movies that actually centre on the Vietnam war.lots of laugh out loud moments, and I love the direction by the master of all things fantastical, Robert Zemeckis.what a movie!"
22651,False,"Forrest Gump, from a humble afflicted childhood, and with a low IQ, goes on to play a major part in the history of the second part of the 20th century.Forrest Gump is one of those movies that comes along every once in a while to light a fuse under the movie worlds bottom! The sort of film that has evident flaws yet packs in so much charm, wit, intelligence and sentiment to make it really difficult to dislike with any sort of conviction. Even those with an aversion to the talent of Tom Hanks would surely be kidding themselves if they honestly fail to see that Hanks, as Gump, gives anything less than an extraordinary performance.What made Forrest Gump such a well loved picture? Garnering 5 golden baldies at the Academy Awards {three of them the main ones} and earning a staggering $677,387,716 worldwide after being made for the now relatively paltry sum of $55 million? Personally I think it has a little of everything that a film watcher wants in a picture, it sure does have things many dislike {the romantic arc, the overdose of sugary sentiment}, but as Forrest lurches from each apparently none-plussed situation to another, the air of the underdog coming thru triumphant sticks in the craw, but, in a most appetising way. We are in the company of a perfectly honest, simple and innocent man, he may not know it, but Forrest Gump has become a champion of the people, both in the film and to us the movie loving public.If by some miracle you still haven't seen Forrest Gump, then I urge you to do so, it may not resonate with you as much as it did/does the majority {argue with the box office I say}, but for towering performances by Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise, and for being a clever movie with its finger on the pulse of Hollywood, Forrest Gump has few peers. 9/10"
22652,False,"Well. When Tom Hanks is acting there is no doubt's that the production will be a box office hit. He is a true prodigy of our time. Forrest Gump can never be told; it has to be seen in order to appreciate this masterpiece. This movie never ages, it really gives us hope and seeing this really makes us think what it would have been like, if the whole world had people like Forrest. Hanks have portrayed the protagonist in his usual brilliant way. Since thousands of reviews have already been given I will not go into details; Forrest Gump can be recommended for any one who likes watching movie with a riveting theme.Forrest Gump will always remain as a true achievement in Movie Making."
22653,False,"have you ever watched a movie and at the end of the movie, you just couldn't figure out why it was written? this happened to me when i saw forest Gump. who writes a movie about a retarded guy who happens to be involved in every major historical event in the 60's and 70's, what would inspire someone to take such an undertaking. the movie is flat out stupid. the plot was silly, the writing was absolutely horrible, the directing, reprehensible however, I read some reviews which say this movie is about right wing politics, to the contrary, the movie is all but right wing, in-fact it's quite liberal. Nothing infuriates me like a horrible movie getting so much revere and attention."
22654,False,"I think this movie (I haven't read book) seems to have an agenda. The main character is mindless but works hard at everything, so he fits into the American Way. Part of his mindlessness is a basically loving nature. This movie is saying that as long as you pick a direction, work hard, put the needs of others before yourself, and be persistent then you will wind up ahead of the game. You will have a basis of wealth, a home, and you won't have un-necessarily exposed yourself to diseases of the mind or body.If, on the other hand, you have a mind and set out to change or improve conditions in the world, you are a fool.That's what I get from this and I am somewhat offended because if there is any credence to the philosophy that this movie advances, then I must be the fool.If anyone sees where I am wrong in my interpretation of this story I welcome comments, as I am very much in the beginning stages of analyzing stories. This one got me in particular.Anyway, the agenda that I am referring to would be Conservatism."
22655,False,...but nothing much to the rest of us. And since the rest of us are many many more we can't be all that wrong. 'Big' in comparison is like a milestone in the history of film-making. I mean think about it. 'I wish i were BIG!'. Inspiring. Universal. Forrest Gump on the other hand is despite the budget a mediocre film about an entire nation catching their reflection in the mirror. And staying there forever in awe of themselves. Wish to be small again.
22656,False,"Wow, I found a number of ""good"" and ""bad"" in this movie, too much to go into detail here without writing what looks like a novel, so I'll condense my thoughts with notes here. I don't expect many to agree with me but overall I found this good very good storytelling and a film that stays with you.The GOOD: 1 - a totally unique story back when it was released and still that way, unlike anything else I've seen; 2 - an involving story. You really care about the lead character ""Forrest Gump,"" who is magnificently played by Tom Hanks; 3 - the story has a good combination of drama, action and humor; 4 - numerous memorable scenes that you'll never forget, especially if you've seen this more than once; 5 - an excellent 1960s soundtrack; 6 - very interesting characters throughout, with solid performances from Gary Sinise, Robin Wright, Myketti Williamson and Sally Field; 7 - a realistic look at some of the unflattering people of the 1960s who were not all ""peace and love;"" 8 - a sweet, tear-jerking ending.The BAD: 1 - The Liberal attitude that having children out of wedlock is just fine is not a good message. (""You didn't do anything wrong, Forrest,"" says Wright, after he discovered he fathered her child out-of-wedlock); 2 - a blatant anti-gun agenda in which every political shooting is duly noted, along with yet another cheap shot made against Richard Nixon, Hollywood's favorite villain; 3 - The Lord's name in vain used 21 times within a 49-minute period, mostly GDs by Sinise.Overall, the ""good"" far outweighs the ""bad,"" making this a truly memorable movie and one that is fairly unfairly blasted by a lot of ""critics."" Maybe they didn't like the '60s radicals portrayed in a negative light. That's too bad. I owned this DVD and got rid of it. I'm sorry I did because I'd watch it again and I've seen it three times. Love it or hate it - you don't forget it."
22657,False,"I've resisted watching this over hyped lump of a film for many many years, until this week when my step-son decided that he would inflict it upon me, stating what a fantastic film it was (he's fourteen - he knows no better!) This film bored me to tears.I cared for not one of the characters. The story was purile, like the characters and like a lot of Spielberg films, it was long, tedious and everybody is suppose to say ""wow, what a fantastic film"". Well in my opinion, I can't see what all the fuss was about."
22658,False,"Forrest Gump is one of the Greatest Movies of All Time. Within this movie was a substantial amount of Life Lessons. I use to watch FG everyday after I watched Pokemon and I absolutely love this movie. I was able to identify with Forrest because as a child I was picked on because I was bowlegged and because I had a mole in the middle of my eyes. He was the perfect example of showing children who feel they are different from others that they can do anything that they put their mind too. Like many of us Forrest experience life and loving a girl that was too afraid to love him back in fear of hurting him and because of what others would say. It showed in the movie that making decisions based on what others think will make you miss out on a great thing just as Jenny did. Not only was Forrest handsome, but he was afforded so many talents that made him very successful rather it educational excellence or not. He was a Success, I feel that FG should be used in Freshman Orientation of 9th grade children because I feel this movie will help a lot of beginning 9th graders with decision making throughout high school"
22659,False,"clearly been very very good movie Forrest Gump. housed a very good drama and romance issues that should be followed good movie. explained very well how to implement positive is checked. Despite being made ​​in 1994, viewed at the same quality every year. Forrest Gump, 1994 US-made epic romantic comedy-drama film. Written by Winston Groom movies adapted from the novel of the same name in 1986. film, Tom Hanks, Sally Field, Gary Sinise playing scenario-Eric Roht, Academy Award for Best Film was directed by Robert Zemeckis doing. Forrest: ""Yes. Well, I do not know. Sometimes rain will permit the stars stood up. He was always nice. Desert looked like just before sunset. Phosphorescence in the water would be millions. Just like that mountain lake.

22660,False,"One of my favourite Maugham stories, one that's little known because it's so short, is 'Salvatore'. It ends with the following unforgettable words:""I started by saying that I wondered if I could do it and now I must tell you what it is that I have tried to do. I wanted to see whether I could hold your attention for a few pages while I drew for you the portrait of a man, just an ordinary fisherman who possessed nothing in the world except a quality which is the rarest, the most precious and the loveliest that anyone can have. Heaven only knows why he should so strangely and unexpectedly have possessed it. All I know is that it shone in him with a radiance that, if it had not been unconscious and so humble, would have been to the common run of men hardly bearable. And in case you have not guessed what the quality was, I will tell you. Goodness, just goodness."" Substitute the ""few pages"" for ""a little over two hours"", and there's 'Forrest Gump' for you, in a nutshell.Goodness, unalloyed and uncontaminated, is always very difficult to portray on screen, and it's even more difficult to make a tale of pure goodness riveting viewing. Grey is always so much more interesting than white. Yet, there are the rare examples of cinematic excellence where the story is just about goodness, and the wonderful places it can take you. Told with panache, and essayed with sincerity, goodness still retains its power to hold. 'Yankee Doodle Dandy', with James Cagney's unforgettable performance as George M Cohan, is one such example. 'Forrest Gump', with Tom Hanks literally living the role, is another.The story is epic in scope. It spans more than half of Gump's life, and portrays how greatness has nothing to do with IQ. There is such a lot to learn, about human nature, from the film, that it can hardly be told within the limited scope of a review. Gump lives his life on the surface, and yet the film is introspective, of life, in the extreme. It breaks the wall of entertainment and takes us to a place where celluloid becomes Art.I'm saying nothing further about the story. And yet, I cannot but omit to mention the scene, near the end of the film, when Gump meets Jenny, luminously portrayed by Robin Wright, and her son. The chiaroscuro of expressions which cross Gump's face in that scene can serve as a textbook example for all who want to know what Acting is all about. The film is worth repeated viewings even for that one single shot.And yet, wonder of wonders, there are those who have panned 'Forrest Gump'. Well, it takes all types to make a world."
22661,False,"I don't know how to describe how a perfect movie is. But Forrest Gump sure can. It gives you all the feelings a film can. It delivers everything you ever wanted from a film. The perfect heroine, the perfect main character, the perfect ending, the perfect punch line. And Forrest Gump himself is a character drawn as to be a man with the most integration you will ever meet. Inspiring. If I could shed a tear, I would happily give it to this film.As you know the film is about the life of Forrest Gump. He starts his story as a story teller (telling his own life) to random people at a bench in somewhere we are yet to know. The film doesn't waste it's time in his past as I would fear to make me bored. Quickly we go through the many live story a man can get. Entertaining as well as thrilling (in a way). As we go through all that, the set goes through the present time of Forrest Gump where it becomes so touchy, you wouldn't expect so. A brilliant performance from Tom Hanks. Too a great performance from the actor of Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise), as I have not seen him in many, but all favorites, but this tops them all. Sinise gains my respect.Easily comes to the top of my favorite movie of all time. Brilliant. 10/10"
22662,False,"I'm a 30 year old guy and this movie makes me cry every time I watch it. What a fascinating portrayal of friendship, curiosity and love.I first remember seeing this when it came out as a child in the cinema, and when Jenny died I shed a tear. Over time, this film has just become better and better and its meanings more profound, to the point where I find myself in tears through almost the entire thing. It's a really beautiful movie.Tom Hanks is perfect, Robin Wright is beautiful, the music by Silvestri is the most chilling beauty he's ever written and everything comes together for this movie like it was just meant to be.I am satisfied, completely, and ten times over. I like Shawshank but because love rather than redemption is something I can relate to more I'd have to say this is my number #1 movie. Just the greatest. I'm really glad I saw this in the cinema when it first came out and can't believe it has touched me so much from my first viewing to my last.One of, if not the most sentimental films I have ever watched."
22663,False,"Forrest Gump was released in a year that included some of the greatest films of all time. The two that standout being Pulp Fiction directed by Quentin Tarantino and Shawshank Redemption directed by Frank Darabont, and this film is on par and arguably better than both of those films. The seamless flow of major historic events seen through Forrest Gumps eyes is achieved through great directing and a great script with some of the most quotable lines of all time. The characters and relationships in this film represent the greatest aspect of America and her history and that is the ability to love one another and the ability to recover and remember. Robert Zemeckis creates this masterpiece through visionary flow a great ensemble cast that include Tom Hanks in his greatest performance as Forrest, and the perfectly cast Gary Sinise as the good hearted, misunderstood Lieutenant Dan. These actors along with others that include Sally Field and Robin Wright form a film that will stand the test of time as one of the greatest films of its generation and generations to come."
22664,False,"""Forrest Gump"" is a classic masterpiece that showed the world the actor that Tom Hanks is, simply PERFECT in every detail. And the director Robert Zemeckis is fabulous. In technical aspects the film is very good, but the story is the one who shines.Here we have the fabulous ""fictional biography"" of the unforgettable Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) a very smart autist. We follow his story since his adolescence to adulthood, having the chance to be part of various historical moments in American history, giving him the chance to meet Elvis, JFK, LBJ, Nixon, John Lennon. The movie always following closely the life of Forrest in a fantastic and inspiring way.The visual direction of Zemeckis works perfectly in this film, from the first scene where we follow closely a feather afloat until the moment when Forrest meets JFK closely.The writing of Eric Roth (screenplay) upon the story is superb, giving us truly emotional moments but also very funny moments. Leaving the movie extremely entertaining and exciting from the very beginning to the feather flying in the last scene.The performances are fantastic. Tom Hanks, no comments, PERFECT in every detail with a performance so innocent and dear; Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan, the suffered and hilarious soldier with a superb performance since his first scene; Sally Field as Forrest's mother, despite not appearing much she has its many moments where her performance shines.A film that is to be watched over and over again. With a heartwarming story, really well written, directed and performance. A story that will make you cry, laugh, have fun and involve lot about the life of this fantastic character. Run to watch now, RUN PEOPLE... RUN!!"
22665,False,"Forrest Gump is a film that is hard to describe. It gives the viewer so much more than a standard drama/romance film. It would call it a 'life' film; one that takes the emotions that everybody feels and serves them on a plate at a 5 star restaurant. Tom Hanks plays the title character in one of the most iconic acting performances of all time. Forrest is, in fact, my favorite film character of all time - and that's saying something. Unlike, some films with great acting roles, the film is not carried alone by Tom Hanks. A whole range of great actors (young and old) are in this breath-taking film. The music in this film is simply stunning; it is filled with child-like lullaby themes to symbolize the childish attitude that Forrest has to life. This is mixed with grand, epic pieces as we see Forrest mature infront of our eyes. The music is some of my favorite in all of cinema and brings a tear to my eye when I hear it. Robert Zemeckis is known for using hi-tech effects to give a unique feel to his films. Forrest Gump uses this technology in an amazing way; bringing Tom Hanks and us into historical events. The cinematography in this film is superb; the iconic feather scene at the start giving us a glimpse of what is to come. But the script is what makes me adore this film so very much; it is so quotable, so witty, so simple, so effective. It is genius!There aren't enough words on earth to describe this film's magnificence, so I will just end by saying that Forrest Gump is most definitely in my top 5 favorite films of all time and will always remain in my heart.I'm not a smart man, but I know what a good film is."
22666,False,"This touching tail of a man with a heart bigger than his brain is amazing. The movie covers almost every genre imaginable: drama, comedy, romance, action, adventure, history... It has something to appeal to any person. This is one movie that you can watch over and over again. each time i watch it i pick up on something i never realized was there. The acting is superb with everyone playing there part perfectly (my favorite is Michael Conner Humphries as Forrest Gump when he was a kid), the filmography is astounding, the story is ground breaking (I find it interesting how they incorporate history into his life story), you will laugh, you will cry, you will remember Forrest Gump."
22667,False,"I know a lot of people may disagree but i find this to be the best movie ever made. The script, the direction and most of all Tom Hanks stunning performance made this movie perfect for me.This movie is about a slightly mentally challenged man (Hanks) who finds himself parts of very memorable parts of history. He tries to do his best and thats exactly what happens. As the story goes on he finds himself doing amazing things throughout the world.This is an amazing movie. Its touching, its breathtaking, its filled with action sequences, its exciting, i could go on forever because this ovie literally has everything you could want and more. There is a reason this movie won 6 Oscars in won award because it is hands down the best movie ever made. This movie is for everyone no matter who you are this movie is for you. 10/10"
22668,False,"Well to describe how I personally see this movie is hard, cause so many aspects of it really are hard to describe in words... It's really something special to watch this guy who everyone said was a man with no real future go trough life in a way we could never expect, with such a simple way to see things while people around him seem to have a hard time simply living... That's where the paradox of Jenny comes into mind, where she seems to always want to find herself in a messed up world, she always comes back to the only man who never saw her for anything else than his best friend and the woman he loves... That is to me the essence of this movie, the power of Forrest Gump is that attraction, the feeling that you're watching an epic adventure trough the life of a simple man who never intended to be a great man but he became one without even knowing it... He lived for the one he loved, his mother, Jenny, Bubba and Lt. Dan... And Tom Hanks captured this essence... I truly believe this is one of the greatest movie of all time... Truly, perfection in simplicity..."
22669,False,"I just recently saw this film and I gotta say, it had to be one of the best movies I've ever seen! This film has everything you could want in a film, humor, sadness, drama, action, etc. The actors were fantastic, especially Tom Hanks, who's performance is one of the best ever. This film also explores a short glimpse of the horror and loss of friends in the infamous Vietnam War, which just added to the film's greatness. Overall, Mr. Zemeckiz has created a film that will live inside everyone's hearts for the years to come. I have never, nor ever will, see a more emotional, gripping, and inspirational film than Forrest Gump!"
22670,False,"I lost count of the number of times i watched this movie. It must have been a dozen times at least. However, every time i'm viewing this movie, it's like seeing it for the first time. It's still as brilliant, cheerful and emotional without losing any of its glance or beauty, and the story stays as powerful as it truly is and keeps you interested till the end. Seeing it for just a few seconds makes you stick to the screen till the end-music stops. The dialogues are perfect, the timing is as a swiss watch, the story-twists are more than one could imagine, and the setting in the enduring storyline of the 60's, 70's and 80's of last century, placing the movie inside the main events of that era, just gives you the idea that this almost could be a real-life story. It at least makes me wish it really was.If there should be a best-movie-ever, i think this movie should be it. It would have my vote at least. Forget the Godfather, LOTR or Star Wars, this truly is a movie that you'll never forget."
22671,False,"The concept of the movie at the first instant might seem a bit absurd because you might seem to wonder how a man can be intelligent and act stupid at the same time. But this is exactly what Tom Hanks manages to do and do it perfectly.This is a story of a man whose IQ is lower than that of a normal person but still manages to do everything in life on his own and manages to find love in his life through Jenny. Every moment in the film emotionally touches you especially the sequences between Jenny and Forrest. The dialogs are really gripping and makes you take notice of the hard-work put into writing those lines.Special mention has to go to the writing department. Not easy to create a character to which audiences can relate. A very subtle story, beautifully crafted and perfectly executed. Director Robert Zemeckis has put up a commendable effort for giving us his most-prized possession of his career.But the film stands firmly on its feet mainly due to Tom Hanks. The actor deserves his second successive Oscar after Philadelphia. He manages to bring out one of the best performances of his career, ably supported by Gary Sinise, a deserving Oscar nomination. The sequences between them are hilarious to watch and they share a great on-screen chemistry.The movie in itself is a revolution. Such movies are hard to come by. Do yourself a favor and waste no time in catching this movie. Just like in the movie all used to tell Gump ""Run, Forrest, Run."", I say to you, ""Run, Viewers, Run."""
22672,False,"Forrest Gump is one of my favorite movies of all time. It tells of a mentally disabled man who has lived through so much history and who did not let his disability hold him back from living an ordinary life. In fact, Forrest lived an extraordinary life that most people do not get to experience. His innocence has made this story humorous and heartwarming. It is very difficult to not fall in love with the character Tom Hanks has created. Hanks has done a remarkable job with portraying Forrest Gump making you laugh while your crying. I have watched Forrest Gump a million times and I can watch it a million more times. I recommend everyone of all ages to watch this movie."
22673,False,"I remember the BBC coverage of the Oscars in 1995 . Barry Norman was asking the Brits in Hollywood - Among them Tracey Ullman and Alan Parker - what they thought of the years nominations and the British view was unanimous that FORREST GUMP was nothing more than an overated mediocre movie . After seeing the film for myself I`ve got to agree with the standard British view - This is an overated mediocre movie It`s impossible to believe anyone outside America could love this movie . The overated ( Third time I`ve used that word in this review ! ) Tom Hanks plays Forrest the local town idiot who experiences many of the truimphs and torments of 1950s 60s and 70s America , and it`s all produced , played and written in a sickly sweet way , so sickly sweet you should watch this with a bucket in your hand so you don`t get any vomit on the carpet.Amazing fact . Both American and non American voters on this site give FORREST GUMP an identical voter average - 8.1 . I`m at a loss to explain this"
22674,False,"Surely Forrest Gump must rate as one of the biggest dupes of all time. Quite how the marketeers managed to pass this off as a great film is beyond my powers of reason. Tom Hanks plays the intellectually challenged Gump and picked up his second consecutive Oscar for his over the top portrayal. A spectacular job considering the Academy do not normally fall for the same ploys as the movie going public. Even more spectacular when you consider that Morgan Freeman was nominated for The Shawshank Redemption. Gump was the Best Film winner as well, even though Pulp Fiction AND The Shawshank Redemption were nominated. I would put this film into the same sort of class as the Wonder Years or Dazed and Confused, nice but nothing special. It's little more than a period piece chronicalling American Life across three decades and how it affected one man, namely Mr Gump. The cast is good with Gary Sinise very good as Gump's Vietnam Sergeant. Sally Field is well cast as Gump's mother, beyond that there is not much to redeem Gump, the effects are very nicely added if nothing new and the soundtrack is predictably well chosen given the period of time it covers. For the most part it's too mushy, way too sentimental and just not much above mediocre. In years to come the Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction will be looked upon much more favourably than the over-awarded Forrest Gump."
22675,False,"'Forrest Gump' is one of those movies that will blow you away from your living room, and into the world of the title character. Tom Hanks does a superb job in acting as the simple-minded man Forrest Gump whose positive look on life and whose kind friendliness will grasp your emotion. Jenny, Lieutenant Dan, and even Bubba are all characters that are well-done enough to blow you away. This movie is truly a classic, and I would personally recommend it to anyone. 'Forrest Gump' is not in the least bit like any other movie I have seen, and though some parts are very sad, happiness amounts in the end. 'Forrest Gump' is a true cinematic masterpiece. Rating: PG-13 for drug content, some sensuality, and war violence"
22676,False,"My suggestions to the film, Forrest Gump review are about the irony of this story, the setting, the characterization, the plot, and the theme. I thought this movie tells us about everyone's life and my opinion of this movie was that I liked it very much and it is very enjoyable to watch. You won't get bored and the plot of the movie always develops. In the movie Forrest Gump, the setting is rather weird because it is set in a small fictional town in Alabama. That is where Forrest starts. Later in the movie the story takes place in the whole world. This means that he represents every human being. The time setting is between the 1950s and 1980s. This time was important to the U.S. history because it was after the World War II and it was a new start for the people of the United Sates of America. Another example of everybody or universal is the character Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump. I think he is a very good actor and the role suits him. When Forrest Gump was a little child he had polio and a low level of IQ. His IQ was around 70. He lived with his mom in a big farm outside the town. They had no money so Forrest's mother used their big house as a hotel. On the first day of school, he met Jenny. Forrest thought she was a nice-looking young girl and fell in love. Another important point of him is that he had polio and everyone rejected him except for Jenny. He had polio as he was born and it is when the legs aren't strong enough to hold you and he had to wear braces. Sally Fields plays Mrs. Gump, she is Forrest's mother and cares a great deal about Forrest. After Forrest grows old she got a sickness and died with an old age after Forrest becomes popular. She was a very good mother to Forrest. Robin Wright as Jenny lives alone with her father in a very small house also outside of the town and her father abuses her very often so she tries to stay away from the house as long as possible. In the movie, Gary Sinise plays Lt. Dane. He was a super realistic character, meaning that he was almost too realistic for this movie. He plays his role really well and my opinion to him is that he is the best actor from this movie. Bubba, he is a fascinating unrealistic character. Myketti Williamson plays Bubba in the movie and was the best friend of Forrest in the movie. He is the meaning of true friendship. The one thing that is unrealistic is that Forrest Gump cannot meet all the presidents of America and all the celebrities that he saw in the movie and run around the world without any reason. It is rather a symbolic meaning. The plot of this movie is very interesting. As time passes the plot development raised always higher and higher. One of the themes of this movie is that the main character, Forrest Gump, represents everybody's life. One of the quotes that he said was ""life is like a box of chocolates."" It simply means that you will never know what will happen in life because you never know what piece of chocolate you will take out. Sometimes you take a good one out or sometimes you take one out you don't like that much. The other interesting quote was ""stupid is as stupid does."" This quote's significance means that you should not judge someone on their reputation but on their actions or it is stupid to call people stupid. This movie was a really good movie. I would rate it really high because the plot of this movie is really interesting and the director must have really thought about it. It would be a really hard movie to make. I think Forrest Gump is a movie that everyone has to watch because you will see how everyone's life is like. The plot is really interesting because it has a big increase all the time. I like that the plot development of this movie was like this. I really recommend this film to everyone."
22677,False,"People seem of two minds about this film: it either moves them to tears or to nausea.  But in reality, it is a well-made film with some strong performances but not more than that.  The core of this movie that is as simple minded as the title character; the facile speciousness of the movie's reactionary attacks on matters I agreed with made me realize just how shallow the movie's entire argument is.But beyond that, the movie is very well made; Hanks's performance could have been annoying in other hands but works well here.  Sinise was excellent as well.  Robin Wright's performance was adequate - I try not to blame her for the movie's implied argument that the social movements of the 60's and 70's were a working out of childhood neuroses - but never really stuck to me. The technical aspects of the film are outstanding, and the movie has a lot of laughs and tears despite its empty headed core.If it helps anyone, this is my wife's favorite movie.  But then, she fell asleep during Casablanca, so...."
22678,False,"A clear case of mass appeal prevailing over cinematic substance. The uber-conservative approach takes to US history is frankly misrepresentational at best. In a technique reminiscent of Woody Allen's ""Zelig"", the title character involves himself in all of the most famous events of the last forty years. Basically, the movie vilifies the protest movements of the 60's and preaches blissful ignorance under the apparently Gump-invented slogan: ""S**t happens"". Why create a hero who celebrates stupidity as a national characteristic is anyone's guess. Any true American patriot with an intelligence quotient above 75 would be deeply offended by the disservice the film does to our country. But even on a purely objective level,  ""Forrest Gump"" is deeply flawed. Not only does the film shamelessly borrow (or makes a very conspicuous ""homage"") from such masterpieces as ""Midnight Cowboy"", it is also poorly structured. Lacking any visible climax, it has a potential to end at any point during its third hour. Alas, it pointlessly drags on and on, as Tom Hanks gets into even more of his ""stupid"" adventures."
22679,False,"Entertaining (but long!), however the message seems to be ""be simple, don't question authority and life will be fine, be angry, politically active, and come to a bad end"".  Not quite the message I think is healthy to spread!"
22680,False,"I was one of those people who had heard all the hype about Forrest Gump and then saw the movie. This movie is too overrated. Yes Tom Hanks pulls off a great performance as this character and it is pretty much a great history lesson, but I dont think it deserved all the awards and acclaim it received. In all I think only Tom Hanks deserved the award for best actor. We all know it's very hard to pull off a performance like that. Look at Sean Penn in I Am Sam....terrible. I wont go into what it's about cause we all know it. I know there are many out there who feel this was a great movie and I wont argue with you, you are all entitled to your opinion. To me I thought Pulp Fiction should have gotten it all that year. It had a lot of things Forrest Gump didnt. But yes there were things Gump had that Pulp Fiction didn't."
22681,False,"Well, leaving aside the sad memories this movie brings me - which don't have anything to do with my overall point of view, I would like to express how annoying Forrest Gump results to me. Tom Hanks is an excellent actor (I don't doubt it), but despite that I hate the movie. Not the soundtrack, which is one of the best, being Almost Famous the obvious exception.Not to offend most of people here (Whose lion' share is from the US), but this movie seems made only for them. Forrest Gump shouldn't have been premiered in the rest of the world. I don't think most of the audience outside the States certainly liked it, though it was a smash everywhere. More probably they went to see it because the word had been out that they had to.I ussually like US movies, but not the silly and patriotic like Forrest Gump. It's an annoying and stupid film whose subject matter is that in the US even a dumb bloke like him may hit the big time.Five out of ten, and that's being too fair."
22682,False,"I have a difficult time watching (and reviewing) `Forrest Gump'.  Despite the brilliance of its actors, of director Robert Zemeckis, and of certain powerful scenes, I find that the overall film itself is a cynical lie.  On the surface, `Gump' is a cheerful film about the perseverance of its genuinely sweet title character.  Under that sweetness, though is a disturbing, uncomfortable message that says daring to dream is a bad idea.For the seven people who haven't seen `Forrest Gump', the film deals with the travels and troubles of one Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), an affable man with an IQ of 75 who manages to bounce around key historical events from 1950 onward in `Zelig'-like fashion.  Forrest inadvertently teaches Elvis to swivel his hips.  Forest accidentally becomes a football star.  Forest accidentally becomes a Vietnam war hero, then accidentally becomes a successful businessman.  (See a pattern?)  Throughout all his travels and misadventures, Forrest is forced to deal with adversity and hardship  and he can never seem to fully capture the love of his childhood sweetheart Jenny (Robin Wright-Penn)  but through sheer niceness and through blind faith in the goodness of others, Forrest invariably manages to push on through his difficulties and to triumph in life.Again, on the surface, a sweet, glowing, feel-good film.  Despite my own misgivings about the film, there's no doubt that Tom Hanks is simply awesome as Gump  he clearly deserved the Oscar he won for the role. He gives Forrest Gump a childlike innocence, but there's more to it that that; there's a certain confidence that he exudes at all the right times, as well as insecurities at his low moments.  Forrest Gump is certainly far more complex than the simple figure he appears to be at first glance, and I can't think of any actor who could've played it better than Hanks.  Robin Wright-Penn is perfect as Jenny, who makes an astonishing journey through the years between wide-eyed to hardened cynicism to the acceptance and understanding of experience.  I'm surprised she wasn't nominated for an Oscar as well.  Gary Sinise makes a perfect counterpoint to Gump in the Vietnam era as Lieutenant Dan, another person who can't seem to travel through life quite as smoothly as Forrest does.  Combine this with a superbly paced film, with moments both funny and sorrowful (often at the same time), as well as some of the best, subtle uses of CGI effects ever put to celluloid, and `Forrest Gump' should be one of the best films of all time.  Right?In my opinion, no.  `Gump' is a bitter, bitter movie.  Look at Jenny's dreams and aspirations, how hard she works to attain them, and how little she actually accomplishes.  Ditto the dreams of Lieutenant Dan, or Gump's friend Bubba (Mykelti Williamson).  For them, their hopes never ultimately amount to anything, not without the `accidental' help of Forrest Gump, anyway.  Forrest, who has no ambitions, and never shows any true interest in doing anything, becomes wildly successful by doing nothing.  In essence, those who dare to dream in `Forrest Gump' are punished for their ambition, while those who do nothing are handsomely rewarded.  Considering that some of Jenny's dreams (and Lieutenant Dan's) are particularly selfish  in fact, a few are downright noble  I found this little understated message to be incredibly disturbing.  It bothered me enough to make me not like this film at all, despite all the wonderful moments it does contain.`Forrest Gump' gets an overall grade of a C+ -- it starts out as an `A', but its dark underlying cynicism drags it back down to that level.  But hey, I could be wrong.  It's simply the Mad Reviewer's opinion.  Good or bad, there's some great performances, and it's also thought-provoking.  Watch it for yourself, and let me know what you think."
22683,False,"Forrest Gump is definitely one of the best movies ever made. It's truly a masterpiece from Robert Zemeckis. It is about an innocent, loyal, humble, honest, modest man. He does everything with good heart and reaches success for life.Although it's an adapted movie from a novel having same name, the movie and the book are very different. For me, it is the only example that shows an adapted movie can be far better than the original book.It has also one of the best performances from Tom Hanks. Robin Wright, Gary Sinise and Sally Field are also very good.""Forrest Gump"" says that doesn't matter if you are different. It doesn't matter if you have a handicap. Even if you are in a position of disadvantage you don't have to be depressed. All that you need is optimism, determination and maybe a little bit of luck."
22684,False,"Tom Hanks is truly a gem to the industry. His peerless and unparalleled performance is the root cause for success of this movie.The movie shows some of the major events surrounding latter half of 20th century in USA. The wit and humor used in the story of this movie deserves praise. Some of the dialogues aThe theme of true love, love without personal gains, is illustrated here.Precisely, the film is going to make you laugh and, at times, cry. It rightly deserves a place in top 250 at IMDb. Simply perfect and must watch movie of 20th century!"
22685,False,"Forrest Gump Film Review by Ivy SmithIn the movie Forrest Gump, Tom Hanks portrays the main character Forrest, a simple man that is not very intelligent but has good intentions toward his mother (Sally Field) and best friend Jenny (Robin Wright). Throughout the movie Forrest tells the story of his life but since he doesn't know any better he was put into the middle of some major historical events that have happened from the 1950s - 1980s. This movie is like no other of the time of its release in 1994, still now in 2015 this movie is a favorite of many. We first see Hanks' character Forrest on a bus bench in Savannah, Georgia telling his story to a stranger that sat next to him. He begins his story at the beginning, him as a boy having to get braces for his legs. His story goes on and he meets Jenny on the bus when no one else would let him sit down. From that moment on Jenny and Forrest are the best of friends. One day bullies were chasing Forrest and Jenny said ""Run Forrest! Run!"" and then he started running and his leg braces broke off and he is a very fast child. After a while Forrest finds himself running away from bullies again and he runs straight across a football field and he gets a free ride into college. He goes to tell that he goes through many big historical events and some of those were school integration, he gets to meet President John F. Kennedy, The Vietnam War, he was on a TV show and met John Lennon a few months or so before he died, he inadvertently helps expose the Watergate scandal and many more events. He tells them through his mind and it seems all too innocent because of his low IQ. His relationship with Jenny continues and he keeps trying to save her but she keeps running away. Through Jenny's eyes you see the hippie movement, drug and alcohol abuse, her sleeping around, and a failed suicide attempt. Jenny cleans up and decided to go back to Forrest and stays with him and soon after she runs away again. Forrest Gump is based off of a book called Forrest Gump by Winston Groom in 1986. The book was more harsh than the movie so the film writers took off some of the edge and made it into a more lovable movie. They took out some of the adventures Forrest had because they were a little ridiculous. The movie took great special effects in how they put the actor Tom Hanks into different scenarios in time, such as being put into a video with John F. Kennedy and using special effects to take off Lt. Dan's (Gary Sinise) legs after the Vietnam war scenes. The movie won six Academy awards for Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Director, Best Visual Effects, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing. The movie was nominated for seven Golden Globe Awards. The film won three of them Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama, Best Director - Motion Picture, and Best Motion Picture - Drama. Forrest Gump was also nominated for six Saturn Awards and won two of them, Best Fantasy Film, and Best Supporting Actor. The movie is also on many lists and it mad #240 on the Greatest Movies of All Time list. I find the movie deserving of all the awards it got and being on all the lists it's on. The acting was great and i could really tell the actors were into the roles they were cast for. Tom Hanks does a wonderful job of playing a disabled man and getting the voice and actions right. I give this movie an 8 out of 10 stars only because it does jump around a tad bit but it works well in the terms how fast you have to go through his whole life. The movie is wonderful and i have watched it so many times with my family and friends. I always find something new when i watch it over again, just those little things you don't notice when you first watch it. I have always found that fascinating."

Even after all the years that past Forrest finds Jenny, although Jenny has made wrong decision in life his love for her gives him the ability to take care of her until her death.

22687,False,"I thought this movie had lot a history in it. It made it funnier for the audience to watch and the way he survived and excelled in each of the obstacle was amazing but the stars it got out of 10 was the real reason to watch this movie. As the movie progressed, the story kept of circulating on forest. It clearly had much of the history in it and the movie is gigantic in scale but i found this movie not that attractive as described. The 7 is due to the gigantic portion of the movie not due to the acting. I guess people like war and things like that therefore it managed that much stardom.

A true inspiration if you ask me. I have had encounters with a lot of people who have been looked at as handicapped and laughed at because of their disabilities. When you watch this movie it really make you rethink the possibility of an individual and their struggles. Their are also moments when Forrest Gump laughs at himself or makes us laugh at his actions, and that reminds me that sometime you need to laugh to keep your spirits up and also stop and smell the roses every now and then. Don't take life to serious to the point you lose your smile."
22689,False,"This made you laugh and cry all the way through, wow that was so clichéd. Tom Hanks was the perfect choice for this role he did it so much justice and just finished the film off.

The great thing about this movie was the fact that it was different, it isn't a repeat of another movie already been made.

Everything about this movie is perfect... no surprise that it was awarded so heavily... sometimes i wonder why they stopped making those great movies... all we get is some sequel or prequel of action dramas... i hope to see some good movie soon in near future... Tom hanks please please, now move over to the Dan brown stuff. one of the best watch ever.."
22695,False,"I just recently saw this film and I gotta say, it had to be one of the best movies I've ever seen! This film has everything you could want in a film, humor, sadness, drama, action, etc. The actors were fantastic, especially Tom Hanks, who's performance is one of the best ever.Once you love this movie you can never ever forget it. it's so unique and wonderful. just a brilliant masterpiece. i'm really lucky that i watched this movie. Maybe thats why it took 6 academy awards.I re-watch it every year.:)I can just recommend it for everybody who wants to see a perfect movie."
22696,False,"What can you tell about a person that he has done everything in his life? That's Forrest Gump. Although he is not an intelligent person he succeeded many things in his life that everyone else can not even dream those things.It's a movie that I really liked it because of the performance of Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump and Robin Wright as Jenny Curran, also good performance made by mother of Forrest Gump (Sally Field).It's a very good movie that it will make you sympathize Forrest Gump although in a few moments you will want to support him and help him to get through the difficulties of his life.A lot of people think that it's only a drama and romance movie but I think that it is also a movie that it has many action scenes that you will keep you in suspense for what is going to happen..."
22697,False,"Tom Hanks delivers one of the greatest roles ever on the big screen. Forrest Gump could not have been as excellent if somebody else was casted as Forrest Gump. Who else could play him ""Jack Nicholson"". I don't think so. He was born for that role and after he schocked everyone in Philadelphia as a man dying from AIDS he goes and schocks everyone in Forrest Gump and wins his second Oscar in a row. All I know is, from the 1st line in the movie you know he was golden and would be winner of the Oscar. He performed every scene like a true composer how good he was. When you watch the movie you don't think it is Tom Hanks up there, you think it is Forrest Gump and that is why Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors ever."
22698,False,"Thirty years of American history seen through the eyes of a simpleton man named Forrest Gump. Watch a little boy with leg braces evolve into a man of many different talents which finds himself at a number of historic moments and yet has no clue what he is doing or why... It's a ""must see"" movie that manages to make you laugh even in the most horrible moments. Even though I had my doubts, Tom Hanks performance is surprisingly touching and funny and the chemistry with Robin Wright, playing his true love, is obvious. To top it all the soundtrack of this movie is one of the best I've ever heard if you're a rock'n roll fan (Elvis Presley, Beach Boys, Aretha Franklin...). Definitely one of my Top 10 favorite movies!"
22699,False,"Amazing movie. Story is magnificent. I watched it several years ago when I was 13 or something and was very touched by it. It actually helped me change something in my life today, I am trying not to over-think everything. The film is about a man who is not smart, actually he has a mental disorder (his intelligence is 50 or sth), but he succeeded in everything he started doing because he chose a path instead of thinking about it, as we all mostly do. In addition he was also a very good person. Mistake of most people is that we all think about pros and cons of doing something. We always ask ourselves that question 'What if I fail?' and that prevents us from success. I think that 99% of people worldwide already watched this film, but if you haven't then leave anything you are doing right now and watch it, you definitely won't be sorry."

Tom Hank's portrayal of Forrest is so perfect that you will remember it forever. The direction is perfect too. The music is absolutely brilliant.

22702,False,"""Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.""  Forest Gump.Forest Gump is not just a movie it is art, which bounces around in comedy, romance and drama. The naïve life of an individual who touches lives and influences his nation as a whole. Robert Zemeckis balances this movie in such a way that when you think you are getting swayed in the comic area he moves to romance, the moment you start to smile at blind love, he switches to drama/intrigue which captivates you.This movie has everything for everybody and its delivery is such that you remember the movie more for the adventures of Gump than his effects on America's history. Many Visual effects were used in the movie to incorporate Gump with historical American footages, like when he met President Kennedy.The movie is based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Winston Groom. The book and the movie do have some similarities and differences, the movie itself is based on the first 11 chapters of the book then skips to the end, some of the other occupations that Gump was involved in were omitted. Some parts that were not in the book were also added like his need for leg braces, also his autistic level in the book is more than what we see in the movie.The film is about an overly naive autistic man, named Forest Gump (Tom Hanks), whose life between his birth and the time he found out about his son Forest Jr. ran through American history, touching lives and influencing others.The most interesting thing to me is that Forest Gump was the man responsible for revealing the Water Gate scandal during Nixon's regime (this is bogus mind you).Winning six out of the thirteen Academy Award nominations, among the six awards, Forest Gump won Best Picture, Best Actor (Tom Hanks) and Best Director (Robert Zemeckis), the movie also won Three Golden Globe awards for Best Drama Picture, Best Actor (Hanks) and Best Director (Zemeckis)Forest Gump was a financial success, recouping more than 10 times is 55 million production cost, this movie has stood the test of time as a classic that all should have in the shelves. It is also recognized by the American film Institute, The film ranks 37th on their 100 Years...100 Cheers and 76th on their 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition). www.lagsreviews.com"
22703,False,"The movie Forest Gump Was the best movie that Tom Hanks ever stared in. Tom Hanks has stared in hundreds of movies that were instant hits but Forest Gump was by far his top performance. There are also many aspects that make this movie the top movie of its time. One scene particularly of the movie really describes what kind of man the main character is and, gives a big glimpse of who he is.Tom hanks has stared in many hit movies; like, The Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, And The Da Vinci Code. This movie is different that other because it really suits the personality of Tom Hanks and, in the making of this movie it is obvious that he had a lot of fun portraying the role of Forest Gump. The character Forest Gump is portrayed as a man who as a child was bullied a lot as a child because of his leg brace and lack of intelligence. He never new the importance of his life. As a child he met Elvis Presley and gave him the inspiration to do his dance moves that were considered atrocious in that day in age. Also had a great talent for running as he discovered as he was running from Bullies who were on bicycles and a truck chasing him through the fields. As he grew up he didn't gain much more brain power but gained the power of care, empathy, and love. This screen play is sure to make you cry but laugh just as much. That is exactly what the directer Winston Groom was trying to achieve with this film.Furthermore, this film is considered by me and thousands of other people across the globe. This movie won 26 awards and nominated for countless others. Critics have made this a easy 8.7 but, I would give it a ten. Sure to make laugh cry and all of the in between. This was the best movie made its century because of the selfless acts that the main character, Forest Gump had done for his country and those around him. His lack of knowledge on curtain subjects he makes up in his empathy for others and the selfless acts for his friends and family.Although, Forest talks funny and some may consider this annoying. This is a long movie that jumps from scene to scene and one has to be deeply involved in the story line to understand it. People may also question the authenticity of all acts that Forest Gump did. People may also get confused with all of the character that are introduced and later plays a important role.Nevertheless, Forest is a small town man who listens to what he is told and always remembered the quote that everyone has hear one time or another, "" Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates you open it up and you never know what your going to get."" That really meant a lot to Forest because he keeps a open mind to all options and everyone has a place in his heart. For example he just joined the military, and met someone named, Bubu. Bubu and Forest soon became good friends and when Bubu got injured in the battle field, Forest ran back into the dense jungle riddled with gun shots and explosions in search of his friend Bubu with out thinking. This really gave a big inside view on the character of Forest Gump. However, the choice is up to you. Do you think this is a movie that you would thoroughly enjoy? Or just another movie that goes down in your list of movies that you wish to see. It just depends on the kind of movie you enjoy and connect to. If you like comedy, romance, war all in one movie, then I would bump it right up to the top of your list of things to watch.Forest Gump"
22704,False,"It's kinda extremely difficult for me to overestimate such a masterpiece because of its glutted images and metaphors through every single moment. Every detail, every action means something in this films, there is no scenes just for eyes watching with brain relaxing. And sooth to say I'm very tired with hearing reviews about ""the film about a down"". A retard (in accordance with the medical sense)? I agree. But human after all, much more humane than anybody else because of the absence of evil within. This is the toughest issue - only a retard (or mentally challenged) person can be truly humane in the modern world? ""Forrest Gump"" is not a manual for ones who want to become a millionaire or a great player or get lucky. This film is about life with many things it contains - from life values to a country history. Furthermore, they all are shown in a different light. So, Forrest Gump is a simple guy without mastermind at all, but squeaky clean and morally healthy man at the same time. He believes in things another people forgot, he has pure heart, being naive, but honest, frank, unmercenary and true friend. He is guileless, though he seems to be an idiot in the eyes of others. Despite of it Gump does make a difference between good and bad things, truly good and bad ones. And I discern this movie as a parable about human being, human life. ""Stupid"" Gump couldn't understand what was the life: ""...if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze...maybe it's both."" But who can say the absolute truth about what is life being? The eternal mystery.P.S. Another point of the film is about parenting (remember ""momma always said"") and how it affects the life time. So Keep an eye on your children, try to be wisdom as possible as you can."
22705,False,"Its a must watch movie for everybody, who wants to see the real picture of life. Indeed every living thing have different experiences in their life span, out of them, we human beings are fortunate enough to speak and express our emotions our thoughts to others. So, instead of giving your valuable time in reading the reviews of what people said after watching this awesome close to life flick, just watch and collect the share of your experience... I can definitely say, this movie is also one of the collectors copy, which every movie lover can keep in their library and share the same with their next generation as vintage movie of our time ................"
22706,False,"When Forrest Gump was released in 1994 it was more of an event than a movie release. This is a brilliant movie...it is full of wisdom and simple truths. Recently, some of the top physicists in the world have seriously questioned if intelligence is a good thing. The only things on earth that like intelligence are home sapiens...and they invented it. The dinosaurs were not intelligent, yet ruled the world for 150 million years. Modern man has ruled the world for only a little over 200,000 years, and with all his ""intellegence"" has made a very bad job of looking after the planet. Homo sapiens probably have very little time left here on earth. When we meet Forrest Gump (brilliantly played by Tom Hanks) he is a young boy. He has an I.Q. of 75. When he is a man he functions like a man with an I.Q. of about 85---88. His simplicity gives him implicit honesty and a foundation of pure goodness. Things always appear to go right for Gump and after a stint in the Vietnam war, he becomes a very rich man. Religion, mysticism and and the political process are three of many things that Forrest cant understand. But he is a banner holder for that dying human behaviour.....common decency. There are other fundamentally simple messages in this great movie. As a piece of entertainment it is magnificent. As a lesson to us all on how we should live...it is spiritual. Much deeper than most people realize...this is a contemporary classic."
22707,False,"Honestly, I never get sick of this movie. Its got all of the elements of a great film (director, cinematography, editing, acting) and I can always watch it and never get tired of it. This is one of my favorite movies, and I think its pretty much one of everyones favorite movies. I can't imagine anyone disliking this film. That's pretty much all I want to say about the film, but it says that Im required to write ten lines. In that case, like my band on facebook! www.facebook.com/GlassCowOfficial I understand that is shameless promotion, but i need to fill space. Anyways, I'm going to end my review here, and I truly hope that my opinion helps persuade you to watch this movie."
22708,False,"I was a mere six years old when this film came out. I have watched it probably a dozen times until the most recent. I avoided watching this movie again because because we've all seen it ""a million"" times, but I recently watched this movie with a more critical eye. I can now say with confidence that ""Forest Gump"" is not only a heart warming tale, but an inspiring and re-watchable film. I absolutely fell in love with Forest's perception of the world. I found my self trying to diagnose him with autism or Asperger syndrome, then realizing that he simply loves every human being. Also I realized that being intelligent isn't all that important in the grand scheme of things. If having a high I.Q. is what makes a man someone to look up to, then, the quote, unquote in quotes ""Brilliant"" Bobby Fisher would be a pillar of society. Forest Gump makes one realize what is really important in humanity. Re- watching this film changed my outlook on life."
22709,False,"This film stands in a class of its own. Right from the start when we see a single white feather drifting around on the breeze until the end of the film you feel as though you are being carried along on an adventure that breathes life back into living. Tom Hanks is simply outstanding as Forest Gump and quite honestly I cannot imagine any other actor in the role of Forest Gump, Tom Hanks has made the role completely his own. Sometimes when I see Tom Hanks in other film roles I imagine him still playing Forest Gump. Forest Gump isn't extraordinary in any way, but the things he experiences are beyond the normal man. You do have to pinch yourself though at times. Is this really happening to Forest Gump or some figment of his fertile imagination. One man mocks Forest Gump for telling tall stories, while another woman present at the same time realizes that what he has been telling them is in fact true, but maybe with some embellishment thrown in for good measure.Forest Gump does it all: plays American football, can run like the wind, has been to the White House to meet multiple American Presidents, gone to war, represented his country at ping-pong, saved peoples lives, befriends somebody who is crippled, run a shrimp fishing business, run across the United Statesand loved a girl. Some people may think that Forest Gump is stupid, but it is a fact that you will find yourself charmed completely by this simple but honest man. You will take him to your heart and see things like he does, in an uncluttered way. And, without doubt you will have a tear or two in your eyes by the end of Forest Gump."
22710,False,"There is too much to be said about these masterpiece. It's very deep, sad and funny, it's pure life with many aspects and problems described very deeply and using beautiful and artistically perfect scenes(i.e. the questions of family abuse and racism (violence) in the world - in the scene at Black Panther party, when they talk about stopping any violence in the country, and their chief beats up Jenny at the same time). I cannot even count all powerful scenes of the movie(it MUST be watched several times to get all of them(for me at least:). But together with numerous genius scenes, it's really amazing how the simple truths in life are touching me in this movie. Like when Forrest admires the beauty of nature, saves his friends, happy about meeting old friend, full of emotions meeting his son, cries when loosing his closest people - there is nothing new about such scenes. But I believe and share his emotions, because he is true and honest."
22711,False,"When I saw Forrest Gump, Rocky suddenly became a close second on my list of favorite movies. Although both these movies are totally different in genre, budget, plot and even levels of acting, their common ground in my opinion is they are both underdog stories. But why Forrest Gump is my favorite movie of all time is way beyond its underdog factor. It is the nature of the film, with an overwhelming message of innocence of heart and purity of soul that I still find an unfathomable experience every time I watch this movie. I have watched it many, many times, and each time I am deeply moved by its simple yet profound inner meaning.As Alan Silvestri's soul stirring original score plays through the opening credits, a single white feather twists, turns and drifts through the air, ultimately landing near the protagonist's dirty running shoes. Waiting at a bus stop, Forrest Gump picks up the feather and places it in a bedtime story book he's had since a kid. As another patron sits besides him waiting for a bus, Forrest narrates his epic yet unbelievable story. And what a story it is! In flash backs it narrates how as a child he was an outcast in society only because his IQ is below average and acceptable levels. But as Forrest continues his story, the one person who believes he is no different from anyone else is his mother, and through her can-do attitude, how he got to be where he is: A decorated Vietnam War hero commended by the US President, an international sports icon commended by another US President, how he influenced pop culture, and how he got to be recognized by Fortune magazine as a multi-millionaire.The very few cynical critics who also enjoyed this movie, feel Gump's fortune from impossible twists of fate are implausible coincidences any real person may never encounter however lucky that person may be, more so with below average intelligence. Maybe so. But let's not forget, Albert Einstein had to re-sit his college entrance examination before he started theorizing rocket science. Coming back to Gump, you have to see him to believe that honesty and loyalty are virtues very few people possess, but for the ones that do, achieving greatness will seem like miracles from heaven.And now for the people who made it all happen. Collecting his second Oscar for best actor in two consecutive years (first Oscar as Andrew Beckett in Philadelphia, 1993), Tom Hanks as Gump is absolutely outstanding and redefines the way you pronounce the word 'chocolate'. Easily the most memorable role of his career thus far, Hanks will make you laugh, cry, and fall off your seat doing both. To this day, John Travolta regrets having turned down the role, and for good reason, as I can't think of anyone else who could have done it the way Hanks did. Playing Gump's only friend, mentor and commanding officer having lost both legs in Vietnam is Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan in his first and only Oscar nominated supporting role. Another exceptional feat here, and together with Hanks, forms some of the best parts in the movie. Hanks and Sinise would appear again just a year later in the dual Oscar winning Apollo 13. Playing the women influencing Gump's life is Sally Field as his ""mama"" and Robin Wright as his one true love, building on a life long relationship since childhood. Both Field and Wright's characters are played flawlessly in a way where Gump's method of reasoning comes from his mother while the inspiration behind his adventures comes from Wright's character as Jenny. Also worth mentioning is Michael Conner Humphreys as young Forrest, who reportedly influenced Hanks' southern Alabama accent and the introduction of Haley Joel Osment as Gump's adorable son. Yes, the same kid who sees dead people in Sixth Sense.Finally, kudos to director Robert Zemeckis for this brilliant achievement in contemporary film making. Adapted for the screen by Eric Roth (another Oscar) from Winston Groom's novel of the same name, Forrest Gump is to Zemeckis what the Mona Lisa is to Leonardo DA Vinci. Besides the six Oscars generated including ""Best Director"" and ""Best Picture"", the true mettle of his work lies in integrating the various components of this film into one history altering, ground breaking, block-buster. What we have here is one movie with multiple genres of war, comedy, romance, drama and tragedy all rolled into one unforgettable classic. With friends like Steven Spielberg and Josh Lucas, visual effects and CGI are incredible to say the least. And to think this film was made more than a decade before Celine Dion's duet with Elvis Presley. If I explain that last line, I'll be letting out some of the best treats of the film. The only way Zemeckis can undo himself now is if he makes a sequel.For those who think Forrest Gump is too much of a dim-wit to make it in this real and fierce world, then these are the people to watch out for, because they are predators who can screw you over without so much as batting an eye lid. And for those who think Forrest is a character in a modern fairy tale, then stop for a second and reflect on what a fairy tale really is. It may be nothing but a fable, but it is always a fictitious story with a moral message. Whether this fable has a happy ending doesn't really matter, as long as the moral of the story is understood loud and clear. And so I can go on and on as to why you should watch this movie, or buy it and frame it and buy another copy just to watch it every other month; but I can never emphasize enough that each time you watch this movie, it will be like reading a chapter from Chicken Soup for the Soul."
22712,False,"Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump, a man regarded by most in the community as having a below average IQ, who experiences many magnificent things throughout his life. His journey takes him across the globe experiencing many historically significant events along the way. Throughout this journey full of accomplishments Forrest far surpasses the expectations that many of his critics had for him. Although his life, as full of successes as it was there was one thing that eluded him, his true love, Jenny. Jenny, played by Robin Wright, was Forrest's lifelong friend and loved interest in the film. ""Forrest Gump"" is the story of a man, who despite the many obstacles' and road blocks in his live rises above these challenges and proves that a man's willpower, persistence, strength, and love are more important than any God given abilities in life. Forrest attends and graduates college on a football scholarship, enlists in the army, serves in Vietnam, meets numerous presidents, successfully runs a shrimp boat business, becomes a husband as well as a father. Throughout his story Forrest teaches us many lasting life lessons.""Forrest Gump"" demonstrates that doesn't matter if you are different. It doesn't matter if you have a handicap. You can decide how to deal with it. Every human being is worth exactly the same, and even if you are in a position of disadvantage you don't have to be depressed. All that you need is the will to look at the bright side of life. All you need is the feeling for true love, friendship and the determination to make yourself and others happy. At times in our life we will realize that things will happen to us that are out of control, but the most important thing is to remember that they way we react to these things is in our control. Intelligence isn't the most important attribute in life. The truly important values are happiness, friendship, love, courage and freedom. The film Forrest Gump proves that our lives are a combination of destiny and floating through life like a feather in the breeze.The film ""Forrest Gump"" is very similar to the film ""Benjamin Button."" Both of these movies involve characters, Forrest and Benjamin, who are faced with, and overcome the unique challenges in their lives. Forrest is mentally slower than most average people are, but he proves that determination and perseverance are just as valuable in life, and with the refusal to give up, anything is possible. Benjamin Button, played by Brad Pitt, encounters his own unique setbacks in his life. He is born with a disorder that makes him age backwards. He's born as a wrinkly baby who is aged as if he were in his 80's. As he gets older his age makes him appear younger. Although this may seem like a big setback for some Benjamin preservers throughout his life and accomplishes many incredible feats just as Forrest did in ""Forrest Gump.""The special effects in the film ""Forrest Gump"" help demonstrate the theme of the movie. A perfect example of how the special effects support the theme of this movie is that Lt. Dan, who is injured in Vietnam, is portrayed throughout the movie as having no legs. In all actuality the actor playing Lt. Dan does have his legs throughout the film. The use of computer generated imaging helps the audience see Lt. Dan throughout the movie after Vietnam with no legs. Lt. Dan, although very depressed early on after his injury overcomes his new fate and becomes a successful, functioning member of society and even gets fake legs in the end of the movie. It is obvious through Lt. Dan, much like Forrest, that in life it doesn't matter if you are different than everyone else, what matters is what you make of your life. You may be drifting through life in a breeze but with some good decisions and a little destiny everything can work out in the end.Symbolism is another element that helped contribute to the theme of Forrest Gump. The white feather that is present in both the beginning and end of the film is representative of numerous characters in the movie. Each character is floating through life ""accidental like on a breeze."" Forrest is most representative of this. After briefly learning of his character, it would never be expected of him to accomplish the things he does in his life. It seems that his fate is almost ""accidental like."" Forrest never really planned his life out, things just kept falling into place for him. The symbolism of the feather is also indicative of Jenny's character in the film as well. Jenny drifts through life, most of the time struggling, never trusting herself or anyone else around her. She drifts through phase to phase in her life, but in the end, like destiny, she ends up back with Forrest.Even though Forrest has some disadvantages in his life, he doesn't let these hold him back. He lives his life like the feather in the wind that is present in both the beginning and the end of the film. Forrest goes through life wondering what will happen next for him, longing for Jenny's love, but letting the winds of his life guide him throughout his journeys. And in the end, like destiny, Forrest and Jenny get to be married together and start a family."
22713,False,"""Mama says 'stupid is as stupid does'"". That was a quote from one of the best movies of all time. ""Forrest Gump"" is the story of a man from Alabama with a low I.Q., whose personality is different from others, but ends up achieving many goals including football, Vietnam, shrimping, table tennis, etc. The story has words spoken by the beautiful writing of Eric Roth, and it was magically directed by Robert Zemeckis. The amazing visual effects were added to plant Tom Hanks in historical landmarks, which makes that kind of movie, a magical movie. The film had a brilliant cast involving Gary Sinise, Robin Wright, Sally Field, and the incredible Tom Hanks as the witted Forrest, himself. The movie was an incredible look of being different while being special, and never knowing what to do in life cause it just happens to you without knowing. That's why I respect this excellent film. This is one of my all-time favorite movies for a reason. It had a terrific cast, it had heart, it meant something, it was entertaining, and it was also quite incredible. A movie like this deserves to be recognized as a excellent movie. Next to ""Titanic"", ""Forrest Gump"" is my second favorite movie of all time. I enjoyed the hell out of everything, and my heart always feels special every time I watched. This is an amazing motion picture, no doubt about it. It's just a shame that nobody can respect the movie's Best Picture Oscar win objectively. Like my Mama always says, ""life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get"". You know what, Mama was right about that! ""Forrest Gump"", in my review, ""A fantastic journey seen through the human eye""."
22714,False,"Well, firstly i was caught sleeping when i first watching this movie in the war scene. but 2nd time i completed it, n boy i should have been really stupid to sleep in the first place. this movie depicts the picture of a underprivileged kid, but it also teaches everyone has a unique talent in them, no one is inferior. its a heart touching movie, and the acting is a true masterclass. this should be one of the best acting performance ever, not just the arduous nature of role the character demands but also with how ingeniously its done. the dialogues, role-play, and all everything is nearly perfect.this movie is laudable not only for hanks acting performance but also for its splendid storyline, and the way it progresses.never keeps you bored and keeps you wanting for more."
22715,False,"About the film: Genre of this film is drama which also includes romance. The film is based on a novel by William Groom and produced by Paramount Communications Company. It is directed by Robert Zemeckis. Its executive music producer is Joel Sill. It was released in the US in 1994 and received many awards such as Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and People's Choice Award. The major characters are: Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump) , Robin Wright( Jenny) , Sally Field( F's mother), Gary Sinise (Lieutenant Dan), and Mykelti William( Bubba(. The story is during the period of Presidency of Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford and Carter. Some part of film happens in Vietnam. The film shows that many people did not agree with Vietnam War. It also shows ""Racism"" in the US. For instance, black students were permitted to enroll in college of Alabama just during the summer. During the Vietnam War, the ""Black Panthers"" were shaped against the War and against racism and unequal opportunities for blacks. The protagonist is a low IQ boy who does great works but not according to specific reasoning and goal. His mother named him ""Forrest"" after the Great Civil War's hero; General Nathan Bedford Forrest. She believed ""Forrest"" reminds him that all people sometimes do things that do make no sense. His actions are really in harmony with his name, for instance, he is a great runner, but as he says in the film, he runs without any reason. When he learns to play Ping-Pong, he plays without thinking. Once in the film, he repeats one of his mother's sentences; ""miracles happen every day"". We can see that his success in any area is somehow a miracle. The feather which is shown at the beginning and end of the film is a means to show the passing of time to a destiny; a destiny in which F's mother believes. Lieutenant Dan loses his belief in God and in destiny especially after his losing his legs in the war. F.G doubts whether we are destined to do some things-as his mother told- or ""are floating around accidental-like a breeze""- as lieutenant Dan believed- or both. Plot The story is about a man named Forrest Gump. It involves two phases; in first phase, F.G speaks about his past life and takes us to different places related to his past experiences. But the events happening for him in second phase are not narrated by him as past memories but are taking place at the same time of being shown. Most of the story takes place in first phase. F.G is sitting on a bench and waiting for a bus in Savannah. He has a small suitcase in which he carries all the important things he has. During the first phase, he talks about his life to strangers who sit on that bench for a short while and wait for buses. Now, his life story: F.G and his mother live in Alabama. He was a boy with low IQ, but his mother sent him to school. When he grew up, he got a football scholarship in college because he could run very fast. The college put him in the All-America Team. After five years of playing football, he got a college degree. After his graduation, he applied at Army. In the Army he made friendship with a person named Bubba who was crazy about shrimping and suggested him to buy a shrimping boat after coming back home. The Army sent them to Vietnam. His officer was Lieutenant Dan. In the war, F.G and Lieutenant Dan were shot and Bubba was killed. In the field of war, he helped other soldiers very much. He ran very fast and rescued injured soldiers from the field. So, he was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Johnson. Because he was shot, he was sent to hospital. There, he learned Ping-Pong from another soldier. He could play it as well as running. So, the Army wanted him to play Ping-Pong as the Special Service instead of returning to Vietnam. After some years, the Army decided he should be on the All-American Ping-Pong team. The Army sent the team to China. He and the team were the first Americans who visited China after many long years. After coming back to America, he became a national celebrity and was given the Congressional Medal of Honor. With Ping-Pong team, he met President Nixon. After Nixon's resignation, the Army discharged him and his service was up. After his being discharged, he bought a shrimping boat and worked on it by Lieutenant Dan. They made a lot of money in a few years and became the leaders of Bubba-Gump shrimping corporation. Lieutenant Dan's belief in God strengthened after being by F.G and seeing miracle-like situations like hurricane Carmen which led to their progress in shrimping. In second phase, we see the events at the same time as they happen. He marries his girlfriend ""Jenny"". Jenny dies because of illness. He takes care of his son whose name was ""Forrest"" too. His son was a smart boy. At the end of the film, the scenes are repeated with a difference: the roles of F.G and his mother are replaced by F.G and his son."
22716,False,"Taken by itself, this is a wonderful movie with a compelling plot, wonderful characters played by talented actors and a balls-out performance by Gary Sinise, who in my opinion deserved the Oscar more than Tom Hanks. It is really an emotional roller-coaster of a movie that people of all ages can enjoy.However, I'm rather conflicted about the sneaky the way the movie turns the truth inside out in pursuit of its aims. In the world of 'Forrest Gump', the Vietnam War was a just endeavor and its protesters were all drugged out, cowardly, sleazy hippies who turn innocent American farm girls into dope-dependent sluts. The social fervor of the sixties is presented as an irrational mania, and conservative norms are uncritically celebrated. The way this movie has been embraced by the hard-core right wing really creeps me out.Still, this is one movie where the 'Willing Suspension of Disbelief' can reap big dividends."
22717,False,"America as the country which is always on the ""move"", the land of freedom, growth; these are the core ideas for many Hollywood movies. The movie Forrest Gump can be considered as one of these movies.it has got some elements of American identity. The story of a man who is intellectually and mentally under grown and underdeveloped but he appears to be appropriate and rightful in the works in his world. He becomes an icon and hits the press all over the country. His dreams turn to reality and this shows that your imaginings will come true if you try hard enough and at the same time if you are well equipped to freshness and honesty. Surprisingly, he visits three presidents, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon. He receives honors and makes accomplishments in table tennis, shrimp industry, Vietnam War. A ""simple"" man from Alabama who travels around the world ""runs"" across America and meets political, cultural figures like Mao and John Lenon as well. The amazing point that makes the main character of the film, Forrest Gump, lovable and believable is that he keeps his childhood innocence into maturity probably because he is not very smart; his IQ is 75 below the normal point which is 80. On the other hand he remains as a child in mind and soul even though he is physically grown. This can be drawn in the picture which he shows his wounded buttock to the President Johnson in the White House while he is receiving his Medal of Honor. This is the indication for his simplicity. He firmly believes in three things God, his mother and his lifelong love, Jenny, which remembers her all the time. Although the movie keeps eye on Gump's life career but mainly it is depicting different periods of American history. For example, it shows scenes from racial discrimination, Vietnam War, Kennedy Assassination, Watergate scandal and so on. In some cases it's hard to distinguish clearly what the genre the movie is, whether it is drama, romance or a satire. It can be argued that the director skillfully amalgamated comedy, drama and documentary into each other. Technically speaking, the movie is a flashback and a narrative mode in which the movie starts from showing the viewers that Gump is sitting on a bench waiting for a bus. At the same time, he tells the story of his life to different people waiting for the shuttle bus. His story is the tale of the nation and the country and even generally the world as well. Visually impressive, the makers could successfully have put Gump in scenes with the US presidents. Even they could have made it possible to hear from Kennedy in Footballers' visit at the White House. Due to this technicality and specialty it won the Academy Award for the Best Visual Effects in 1994. The movie is ranked as the 71st of the best motion picture of the all time by (AFI) American Film Institute. Gump's capability to be in the right place at the right time makes him exceptional, too. He saves the lives of the American troops in Vietnam War while he was looking for his intimate friend Buba. Once He ran like a wind into the football field and he made part of his life career as a footballer star by being too fast in the matches. He is the one who calls the police and apprises them the weird condition in the hotel which was the lead to disclose the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of Nixon. His simplicity and honesty is playing a key role in all these situations. Despite being not ""normal"" as the doctor and headmaster tell to Gump' mother in the beginning but he makes a very successful life career which makes him well known and much more generous and giving .The lessons that Gump are given by his mother are very simple but very helpful. One of them is faith and believes in destiny. To do your best but at the same time to keep your faith and be faithful on what destiny brings about to you, to accept it and ""live"" with your ""life"". The main message of the movie can be ""when there is a will, there is a way."" And as the British people put forward ""Honesty is the best policy."" These two are as the secret to happiness which Gump finds it in his life. Other than that his life is inspiring for many such as Lt. Dan Taylor and even Jenny who accuses Gump that ""you don't know what love is"" but finally backs and returns to the ""kind but slow-witted"" man to make her own life much more ""meaningful"" and cheerful. She even gave birth to a child and named him ""Forrest Gump""; a new generation but with the old and respected values and beliefs. Forrest Gump's tale and world is ours, too; with too many ebbs and flows; with sorrows and joys; with defeats and victories. But the tool and rule to overcome the difficulties is simple; to be honest and hopeful. He is exceptional mentally but not morally. His morals help him to make the ""Forrest Gump"" an icon in the movie and in the real world as well."
22718,False,"For me the film is a promoter of American culture and values and I want to look at the film from this point of view. It is the promoter of the American values using both conservative and liberal values, but the conservative values are more dominant and highlighted and liberal values are loosely used to promote just the American culture and at the end liberal values are defeated by conservative values although both ideologies are used to promote the American culture. The film also uses the American icon and figure to promote the American culture.Family is and home are very important in film, Forrest mother is a devoted mother who does her best to keep the family and nurture her child although Forrest father is not present and may leave the family but the mother asserts that that he is on vacation so she wants to that they are a family. ""there is no place like home"" and ""family forever"" these themes can be seen in the film when Forrest, Jenny and their child return their home, Greenbow, Alabama, as a family. Gump is the man family, he is loyal to his love and does his best to have his own family. Gump is a hard working guy who works and tries hard to achieve happiness he expects nothing without hard-working. From the beginning Gump is running and he even runs across the US, symbolically ""chasing the American Dream"". Gump also is religious person, after returning home from China he says that people in China do not go to the church or he goes to the church to pray in order to have a big shrimping. Forrest also uses liberal gestures, like participating in anti-Vietnam War rally and taking part in a TV show to talk about his experience in China, telling that Chinese people are deprived from freedom and basic human rights. Gump is the symbol of conservative values and Jenny is the symbol of liberal values but at the end Jenny is dead but Gump as the symbol of the conservatives is the source of maintenance and continuity of the American culture.Totally the film was made to appeal to conservatives and invalidate liberals but to promote the American culture even by utilizing liberal values. It also is a condemnation of the counterculture movement of the 1960s and its aftermaths. Jennifer Hyland Wang, movie critic, argued that Curran's death to an unnamed virus ""...symbolizes the death of liberal America and the death of the protests that defined a decade [1960s]."" Even the main structure of the film crew connote the conservative orientation of the film. Steve Tisch, one of the producers of the film is a conservative person who has produced other conservative film after Forrest Gump like Knowing and The Pursuit of Happiness that the later one alongside Forrest Gump are among the best 25 conservative movies by the National Review magazine."
22719,False,"For the longest time this was my favorite film. Even though it isn't anymore it's definitely in the top 5. I've seen this film so many times, I could recite the whole thing. This film made Robert Zemeckis one of my favorite directors, and Tom Hanks was all ready one of my favorite actors, so this really helped.Tom Hanks is so charming as the simple minded Forrest Gump, who, growing up in the 60's, 70's and 80's, inadvertently becomes involved with the key moments of the 20th century, including Vietnam, Watergate, winning a Medal of Honor, meeting multiple celebrities, etc. He goes through life simply doing what his mamma, (Sally Field) and his best friend Jenny, (Robin Wright) tell him.This film has some of the best quotes of all time, the main one being ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get"". This film has so much going on. It's so inspirational, teaching you so many lessons on life.Robert Zemeckis cleverly plays around with history, adding Forrest into key moments through great visuals and photoshopping, or just plain playacting. The visuals are really great if you know what you're looking at. The music score by Alan Silverstri will get you crying more than once. The soundtrack ranges from the 50's to the 80's, milking the biggest artists of those years as the decades flow through.Possibly Tom Hank's best performance as Forrest. He can be funny, but he can also be strong willed and confident. Robin Wright is a great supporting character, being Forrest's main push in the movie to keep going. Sally Field as Forrest's mamma is also really supporting, raising him on his own at birth and supporting his decisions. More characters are introduced throughout, like Bubba, Forrest's friend in Vietnam, and Lieutenant Dan, (Gary Sinise) Forrest's Lieutenant in the war.There's so much in this film, it's such a long but fun journey. I highly recommend this if you're looking for a really good inspirational feel good movie."
22720,False,"Touching, Sad, Romantic, Happy, Wars, Friends, Marriage, Family, and most of all love. Forrest Gump. Made me cry. Made me feel good. Forrest Gump is a loving person. He got friends. He joined a war. He is good at running, Has a girlfriend named Jenny. They marry and they have a son. Jenny says goodbye. ""Life is like a box of chocolates. You Never know what you're going to get."" There is a lot of people. But there is only one Forrest gump. He is helpful and a good friend. He taught himself how to run. He was friends with Jenny since he was a kid. This film delivers. Watch it now and you will be proud. Tom Hanks best movie. Go watch it."
22721,False,"Forrest Gump tells the story of, well Forrest Gump. The man was born with some disabilities, but he has overcome them and somehow seems to be present at a lot of historical moments. He's in love with his childhood friend Jenny, who constantly eludes him. The film that beat my favourite film of all time at the Oscars. I'm not hating it, I think that both films deserved the title. Forrest Gump is something else. It seems to have been one of those, right place at the right time flicks. Everything about it simply works, it's heartwarming, funny, intelligent and depressing. Tom Hanks gave us an unforgettable performance that goes down in history as one of the greatest. He is lost in this character and Gump takes a life of it's own. Probably one of the most lovable characters in the history of cinema. Jenny, the woman of his affections is played by Robin Wright Penn, her performance is almost saddening. Her life is constantly spiraling out of control and you can do nothing to stop it. Gary Sinise is hilarious as Lt. Dan, the hard ass in the army who loses his legs. We love to hate it at the beginning, then we come around, much like his character. Speaking of losing legs, despite the film not needing a heavy load of CGI, it uses it beautifully. Inserting Gump into old footage and giving Sinise the lack of legs among other things. These are small things compared to what people are doing today, but Zemeckis has always been one to push technology in films, here he does it very well and never does it encompass the film. The story is forefront, something that he needs to get back into.Forrest Gump is an everyman film. Meaning the almost everyone will like it. Some political messages may turn people the other way, but the overall feel of the film is something that a lot of people share. Every once in a while there is one film that touches a lot of people, I think Forrest Gump is one of those films. Even though the film goes off in many different directions, it works. Forrest in the army in one segment, then running around the country in another? I love it."
22722,False,"This movie presents life in a movie, you get to see a movie with full detail on how people live everyday. I highly recommend you see this movie as it is very educational movie that will touch your emotions. The movie will continue be seen for many generations so if you've not watched this movie yet then you're missing out. That being said this is an excellent movie with great actors."
22723,False,"Winston Groom's Forrest Gump was a novel that was complicated, but (Oscar winning) director Robert Zemeckis brings events together with visual effects that boggle even George Lucas. And leading the film in this odyssey of American life is Tom Hanks playing Gump (he won his second Oscar for his portrayal) in a film that shows one man who goes through many events in history to find the one he loves. Well done, well acted, and well directed."
22724,False,"Definitely, a good watch! I learned a lot from this movie! It is an old movie but still one of those that I would love to watch over and over again. I like the choice of characters and the plot itself. It moved me. The actors chose acted well.The movie made me cry. I cried a number of times while watching it and every time, I watch it again. This was brilliantly done! It showed different cultures. Though some scene broke my heart, still I enjoyed watching it. The movie made me understand grief and loss. It made me understand the realities of life more. This made the movie more powerful. I love the play of different emotions, matched with the wonderful performance of the actors. In the last funeral that I attended, I was reminded of the movie."
22725,False,"This movie was absolutely stellar and I love how the story was able to make me feel like I was the one telling it. Whenever you can share an experience that makes you forget it's not your reality it is a job well done. This is my first review ever for a film and I knew if I did one I would have to start with this classic. The music was also amazing and complimented the film as well. Lastly, Tom Hanks gave one of his best performances ever. Another thing of note was how they were able to cover so many major events throughout pop culture in just one film. There has been other films to attempt to capture the same magic as Forrest Gump like Benjamin Button which is also good but haven't been able to do so. It's one of the few films that have adapted a novel perfectly."
22726,False,"My favorite movie of all time. I think this movie is perfect: the script, the story, directing, characters. I love the performances of the actors, one of the best roles of Tom Hanks in my opinion.It' s a movie that I can watch 1000 times and I don't get bored of it. It includes all the genres: emotional scenes, funny scenes, even action scenes. The relationships between characters and the building of the characters are extremely well done. My respect to the director Robert Zemeckis for doing an superb job. Gary Sinise made an extraordinary performance as Lieutenant Dan Taylor. To sum up, a spectacular movie with a terrific story, an entire life of a character that is impossible to not fall in love with, or at least like him. It's definitely one of my favorite movies of all time because it's a movie that make me feel like I am near Forrest Gump in every second of his life, and also, it's a movie that I can watch anytime and I think everybody needs to see this film at least one time in their lives. 10/10"
22727,False,"I out off watching this movie for years because I thought it was going to be boring and drag on. I finally watched it last thanksgiving and I regret not watching it sooner!!! It is such a touching story and has meaning to so many people. I wont speak to the meaning of the movie, because as a writer I realize that everyone takes something different from a work of art. My advice is don't listen to people and their crazy ideas and beliefs. Listen to your heart or gut or head. Which ever you prefer. And do what you want. Read what you want. Write what you want. Watch what you want. (As long as it is appropriate for your age.) You can always ""regret"" doing something later on."
22728,False,"Forest Gump is a great movie. I watched it over and over again and never bored. Tom Hanks is a great actress and the film really has added value. I always appreciate and congratulate such actors. I hope it continues to play better movies. The green road film has a distinct place in my heart. I cried in the boss scene, putting out the lights. I hope it continues to play great movies. I hope we have a better chance of watching. It's a movie I would recommend to everyone. Wonderful and beautiful. Thank you to those who made this film. Especially the love to the girl is great. It's like romantic comedy, but there's a lot of information in it. Masterpiece."
22729,False,"It became one of my favorites movies and i'm not that into movies.I watched after one of my friends showed me the book and i thought ""why not?"" and i didn't know what the movie was about and i was amazed in the end. Did i cry? Yes. Did i suffer with Jenny and Forrest? THE ENTIRE MOVIE! But i loved so so much and even made a review in my blog. I'm very into history and fun facts and seeing that on the movie made me laughed and i felt intelligent watching a movie which it doesn't happen very often. Tom Hanks is spectacular as ever and everyone should watch Forrest Gump and i feel like Forrest Gump was made for Tom Hanks because i can't imagine any other actor in his place. I have to say that i miss this kind of movies."

The acting is warm, perfect and makes me think, has there ever been a film that makes me not want to blink..I'll love it forever and beyond that I'm sure, Forrest Gump is my inspiration I live by his determination and more..I wish they allowed us to give more than a 10...Rhyming Tyrrell"
22731,False,"I don't know how many times I've watched this movie. We didn't have cable at this time and all we had was a DVR. Each time I noticed something new in the film. The characters were well thought out and the actors stayed within their creation's limits. Quite believable and lovable. My family and I found the movie to keep us engaged from start to finish and still keeps us engaged when we discuss those lean years financially. Forest, you are all we had! The southern setting was perfect for the movie and the cinematography didn't skimp on giving us an eyeful of how people live down there. Love the south. The interaction between Forest and the events through the time line were well interlaced and seemed to explain when some of those events were the way they were. A great Saturday night movie."
22732,False,"An awesome film about the will to succeed and the chance of beautiful meet. Tom Hanks shows us an extraordinary acting game, one Anti-hero, who despite the stupidity managed to be happy through the Challenges of life. A beautiful story, funny and moving. Replicas Simple that mark the spirits, and make of this film a trip in the "" ""American way of life"". Everything is possible in the country of Uncle Sam American cinema full of cliché and beautiful moment. You have to run to see it By eating good chocolates.

Heh hey. ____ Forrest Gump: There was this man giving a little talk, and for some reason he was wearing an American flag for a shirt. And he liked to say the 'F word' a lot.

22734,False,"As a big tom hanks fan forrest gump has to be one of my favorite of his movies great cast well written movie about a man with the mind of a child and they show the world through his eyes the man went to school played college football became a war hero met two presidents not bad for a man who people though would never amount to any thing overall this is a 4 star movie and wished more movies would have a great story to tell,if you like history comedy romance a few things getting blown up here and there then this movie is for you i was 12 when i first saw this movie and it keeps getting better every time i see it every one should see this movie at least once"
22735,False,"This is the only film for which I can use the word ""Beautiful"" without any hesitation. 6 Academy Awards, $677,387,716 in box office & 8.8 rating in IMDb combined don't say it all.Tom Hanks portrayed the role of Forest Gump more than perfectly. Other supporting actor and actresses weren't that memorable. But that's for the sake of the story. Robert Zemeckis probably taught us how to direct. Hanks & Zemeckis did the best job of their career.Film editing was flawless. They shot the film in different locations and every single one of them added a new level of greatness to the film. The musics weren't much noticeable. Also weren't the visual effects. Which is actually a big success, because I thought they didn't use any visual effect.The story is simple, plain and for some mysterious reason also sad. Forest Gump will teach you how to live life. Miracles and shits both happen for a definite reason. You'll find out what's your destiny is, but not before you fulfill it. Just float around like a feather and you'll be OK. Do what you feel like, don't do it for any other reason.p.s. Those who are criticizing, there're more to a film than just the story. And about the academy awards, open your mind."
22736,False,"This film can be described in so many ways. One may call it, inspired, clever, brilliant, heartwarming, truly unique. I call it genius. In my years i've yet to come across a film to impact me on such an emotional and profound level. Forrest Gump as a character is so dynamic and relatable. His arc is so intriguing to watch, and the friendships he makes throughout his life are just as relatable as the character himself. This film nourishes love and acceptance in it's purest and most human forms. I felt joy and anger and sadness all at once. It truly is one of the greater cinematic works of our time. Though it's brand has become kitschy and commercial for major cities to serve up their ""Bubba Gump Shrimp"" specialties, the film has earned its renown. ""Forrest Gump"" is and will be in my top five favorite films for many years to come."
22737,False,"One of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The story is so nice to watch. And I see it over and over again. Tom Hanks is the best actor. He plays full part in the film which has been the greatest of all. nice one to be seen in this arena. The movie length is also fine to watch. There will be no boring scene in the movie if you are a movie lover. Forrest Gump is a simple man with a low I.Q. but good intentions. He is running through childhood with his best and only friend Jenny. His 'mama' teaches him the ways of life and leaves him to choose his destiny. Forrest joins the army for service in Vietnam, finding new friends called Dan and Bubba, he wins medals, creates a famous shrimp fishing fleet, inspires people to jog, starts a ping-pong craze, create the smiley, write bumper stickers and songs, donating to people and meeting the president several times. However, this is all irrelevant to Forrest who can only think of his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran. Who has messed up her life. Although in the end all he wants to prove is that anyone can love anyone."
22738,False,"This movie is very emotional and suspenseful. The movie is also very sad. Some of the parts of the movie brought about a couple of tears to my eyes. The saddest part of the movie that triggered a couple tears was when Forrest Gump and his comrades were fighting in the war and he watched one of his closest friends fatally die slowly by the enemies. As he watched, others were getting shot as well. Another sad part of the movie was when the woman he very well loved left him to search for a better life. This left him devastated. The worst part was that he never did get to at least say goodbye. She left early in the morning while he was still asleep. This is my review on Forrest Gump."
22739,False,"Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), while not intelligent, has accidentally been present at many historic moments, but his true love, Jenny Curran (Robin Wright), eludes him.This film is fun, funny and touching, if not a little bit sad. If a school wanted to (and no doubt some have), it would be an interesting way to teach the second half of the 20th century. Elvis, Wallace, the Kennedys and more.This is probably the film that ""made"" Tom Hanks. Although he was already big in the 1980s with ""Big"" (no pun intended), this was probably the turning point where he went from comedy to serious actor (well, somewhat serious). And it probably remains his most-watched movie of all time (well, besides maybe ""Sleepless in Seattle"")."
22740,False,"Forrest Gump, I think is a beautiful film. Never too schmaltzy, but there are some genuine tearjerkers like Forrest at Jenny's grave. The cinematography is stunning, the costumes are lovely and the scenery is gorgeous. The music is also very calm and relaxing, perhaps adding to the tone of this film. The screenplay is well crafted, and the story is simple. But what made this movie was its simplicity; it never tries to be too complex and is consequently moving. The acting is just as impressive; whilst Tom Hanks's accent is a little awkward in places, my only real criticism of this movie, he gives a truly remarkable performance, though I do think Morgan Freeman deserved the Oscar more for Shawshank. Robin Wright gives possibly the best performance of her career, and Sally Field is very dignified as Forrest's mother. The scene stealer though is Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan, a very moving and insightful performance. Overall, an extremely good movie, I will admit I wasn't sure whether I would like it, but the simple answer is this, I do. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
22741,False,"One of the best movies in 1994. The best time I watched it, I was still a teenager, so I couldn't understand it well. And once, I heard it was on Top 250, I've decided to watch it again. So, after I've done watching it, it was such an excellent movie. Forrest Gump, an idiot from Alabama, has witness many historical things. And he even met those presidents. And he even had his own shrimping company. And Tom Hanks did such a great performance, he has never done such a great performance in any other movie. And Robin Wright, played Jenny, which was Forrest's girlfriend, did a great job too. This movie is meaningful, it can give you a special message after you done watching it. Don't spend times on those meaningless movies, this is the best choice for watching. My vote is ten. Robert Zemickis is great."
22742,False,"This movie is the story of a little boy with below average intelligence, but with a heart that's worth far more than a few little I.Q. points.Tom Hanks delivers this outstanding character to the screen and his performance is truly captivating; just like the story of his life. The Beautiful Robin Wright brilliantly portrays Forrest's most cherished friend and childhood sweetheart, Jenny. And this review wouldn't be complete without thanking Gary Sinise and Sally Field for their wonderful contribution to this truly heartwarming experience.Forrest's story sees him touch the hearts of the entire world with his simple innocence and strong will to do only what is right; making life better for many people along his journey.Forrest Gump is a movie that you feel as you watch, you will empathise with the character of Forrest, sharing his experiences whether they are humorous, heartwarming or tragic. And along this journey you will learn a great deal about life and its many twists of fate.Good enough to inspire everyone, even the most cold hearted among us.10/10 Unmissable, Unforgettable, Brilliant"
22743,False,"A fairy tale expression of recent American history. This has Tom Hanks playing a simpleton as the embodiment post-war America and the fact it won Oscars tells us more about American pop-culture than any erudite books might wish to say.Tom Hanks plays Gump, a rather ""slow"" boy who grows into a ""slow"" man and yet manages to involve himself in major events in American history: racial integration, Vietnam, Watergate and so on, and yet always manages to remain unwittingly on the side of Liberalism.In other words, this rather saccharine and somewhat nauseous film is trying tell us that what is good about America is the simple homespun values of innocence and goodness whilst presumably anyone with an IQ of above average is not to fully trusted. A naive message in the least which to anyone with an IQ over 100 or anyone living in Europe seems the cause of so many problems rather than the solution.If you are looking for a black and white view of the world, an idealistic and simple and sop for conscience view of the world, then this might help.For those with an IQ over 100 I would suggest you go elsewhere."
22744,False,"As my 10 reveals this is one of my favorite movie ever. It's a movie about what matters most in life...family, friends, love, honesty. I liked the imagination of the author, the story is simply fantastic and the acting...well he got an Oscar for it so I got nothing further to say about it. I think Forest is the luckiest man ever and not because of the money, because of his naivety. Why? Because thanks to that he saw only those important things. He didn't care about winning a game or winning the war, or making money, or buying a fancy car, or having sex, or any material thing whatsoever.He kept the life simple and I think we should do the same....except the part with sex :)"
22745,False,"Firstly, the top ten is this: 1. Good Will Hunting 2. Godfather 1 3. Godfather 2 4. Forrest Gump 5. Heat 6. Shawshank Redemption 7. Blow 8. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid 9. The Shining 10. Ferris Bueller's Day OffSecondly having Forrest Gump at an 8.1 average is ridiculous, who in there right mind votes less than a 9?? Watch it again, its exceptional. And if you don't like it and think 'this guy's an asshole' try viewing the above list and try that on for size.Thirdly, Hanks is a fine actor, not quite in the league of Pacino, De Niro, Nicholson, Walken or Brando, but he is in the Newman/Norton/Cage/Depp/Spacey/Freeman bracket and that says something. I would put him in just above them but just below the greats. Fourthly, how the film follows and depicts American culture through his life, and cleverly entwines his simple experiences within important historical context is captivating and endearing, sad and funny. Hanks plays the role better than any other could.Fifthly, soundtrack. Step back through time and listen to differing social periods as they role from one to the next. Buy this and you wont be skipping many of the tracks.Sixthly, see you later."
22746,False,"I didn't mind this movie too much the first time I saw it, though I thought it was very over-rated and wondered what the fuss was all about.I caught it again recently and got more irritated with it the longer it went.I'll admit that the shots integrating Tom Hanks into historical footage are impressive, technically. I'll admit that Hanks, Penn, and Sinise give very impressive performances. But I'm really starting to hate this movie.I know, I know...of COURSE it won Best Picture--it's cynically designed from top to bottom to do that. It's supposed to teach an important lesson about life while tugging at the heartstrings as big historical events unfold in the background. And what is that lesson? It pays to be stupid.
Well, gang, sorry to burst your precious little bubble, but it doesn't. You won't find guys like Forest running corporations; you'll find them in trailer parks, beating their kids. Them clever folk, with all that book learnin' you so despise, are running the big corporations, and they're laughing their way to the bank over the real morons, who watch crap like this and think it's great and then vote in Forest-like mental midgets to run the country.The worship of the ""wise fool"", the disdain for education, and the myth of the self-made man are a few things Western, and especially American culture would be better off without. Anything like this cynical and manipulative film, which perpetuates them, should be despised, not lauded."
22747,False,This movie is one of few movie that makes you a better person after you watch it. Excellent acting and directing makes this one of the best movies ever made. With all the garbage made in Hollywood this film restores your faith in movies.
22748,False,"What I mean by this is, if a group of friends really wanted to rent it, I wouldn't spend a 'veto' against the film with the group, but I wouldn't pick it either. It's tolerable if you don't expect too much from this 'box of chocolates'.I saw this when it came out, and I haven't seen it since.What struck me, was that when it was over, that people exiting the film were completely silent. I don't know why the other people in the theater were silent, but I was because the film really didn't deliver. I felt it took me on a long trip to nowhere. Those in my group felt the same way. But clearly, many other people feel otherwise.While somewhat watchable and pleasant enough to see unfold, and mildly funny at times, expectations of 'something profound' are instead met with a really shallow parade of clichés and stereotypes in a narcissistic baby-boomer nostalgia orgy, the kind of thing that was already wearing out it's welcome from 'the big chill' film & 'thirty-something' type TV shows.The viewer seems obligated to sit there and click on pop icons of the baby boomer past, to make them get off the screen and move on to the next. It's a very shallow parade through history.I'm not politically correct by any means, but it does seem like the worst stereotype was pushed of the Vietnam vet, along with other characters, I'm sure many people found some of these characters degrading. A 'slow person' was kind of made fun of, without any real purpose. Some parts of the movie, such as 'the run' was just spontaneous, stupid and pointless.If I had no real expectations, I might not have found it as offensive. But the presentation as though this was something culturally profound when it's not left me flat."
22749,False,Forrest Gump is an outstanding movie. Every bit of the movie is classical. It touches the heart of the viewers on every scene. I love watching the movie. Its different from conventional movies as it has a strong plot and is closed to reality and fascination at the same time. The cast is good. Especially the way Tom Hanks has performed. Its a family movie. Its a ever green movie. I recommend this movie to everyone.It touches the heart of the viewers on every scene. I love watching the movie.

22750,False,"Was Forest Gump made with the intention of being a depressing movie? I don't really think so. I think it was made with the intention of being sad at parts, but ultimately a feel good movie that was supposed to be quite funny at parts, entertaining, and even educational...not to mention a great soundtrack.For me, the movie was all those things, but unfortunately, I found the film, throughout all these jokes and happy moments, to be depressing. For a guy who doesn't cry much at movies, I bawled at this one.I don't really know what my point is...I was sad.10/10."
22751,False,"The most dishonest, hypocritical movie ever made.  It disguises its right-wing political message by using Gump to cover up its commentary on the 60s--which is profoundly nasty and negative.  He is a hero because he can ignore all the social evils around him--is that not a commentary?  I understand that the moviemakers denied they were trying to send a message. They lie.  I'll take my political propaganda straight, please."
22752,False,"The moment I saw that Tom Hanks made a movie called Forrest Gump, I knew it was about some person's life, as all movies whose names are the name of a person.But there was something different about Forrest Gump... This shocked me a lot, it was just different than other movies, and I could not figure out why.There is no doubt about this: Tom Hanks best performance. (In my opinion..) I think nobody could have done a better job than Hanks, because he was simply spectacular.This movie was so good, because while watching it, you get to like Forrest, and you don't want anything bad to happen to him, and you feel good when he does something right, or when he gets good things, even by luck.It also had a bit of comedy, which I think it was nice... (As a matter of fact, I think the little comedy parts of this movie were funnier than the whole Austin Powers movie).Forrest Gump really got into me.. It's a feeling that is a little hard to explain.. But if you watch it carefully and paying a lot of attention you'll probably find out how good this movie is, and how real things are.. This movie could have been a true story.. After all, nobody knows if there is someone out there just like Forrest Gump.When I finished watching this movie, I knew it would definitely win both the best Actor and best Movie awards.This movie deserves a 10/10 score.. more than a lot of other movies that are rated higher than this."
22753,False,"In my opinion, this movie is one of the best ever made. Tom Hanks created an extraordinary character and deserved an Oscar. The film is so deep it is hard to describe it in words. I don't have emotional problems but I always cry on this movie. I don't know why but ""Forrest Gump"" is perfect for me. Perfect in a positive and creative way. It fits into my heart. It gives unforgettable scenes which are a true masterpiece. Every moment of this film is worth watching. This picture shows life in a fascinating way. It shows the journey, fantastic voyage through time and different aspects of life. There is also death in this film - event that we can't escape or evade. Everyone has its destiny. My destiny was to watch this movie and never forget. I will always remember this excellent piece of art. This is absolutely my number 1. ""Forrest Gump"" is a unique masterpiece. Great film about life itself also about one amazing human life."
22754,False,"If Eric Roth looks at this -- would be honored to say thank you for ""Forest Gump"". I know several more remote and esoteric films, but every time I see Forest Gump I come apart at the seams, more Kleenex each time... and it's so worth it! Love is woven alongside tragedy it in a way that makes me feel I'm riding one big crane shot of life. Gump strips down what it means to be human in such a pure and heartbreaking way. I know film is a collaborative medium (and though I'm pretty sure Tom Hanks is our best bargaining chip for sparing the planet if we ever have negotiate with hostile aliens, but his brilliance aside...) as a screenwriter, I want to thank writers like Eric Roth and Winston Groom for being the creating inception of a film so beautiful, it inspires the rest of us -- especially me -- to keep aspiring to make something good and to believe it's worth it to try.Thank you.Jilena Cori PS: Maybe I'll go blubber all over Tom Hanks' message board now... damn, outta Kleenex..."
22755,False,"Forrest Gump is well, probably the best movie made by Hollywood. It captures the aspects of everyday American life but of that of man who has experienced war, met the president three times, met Elvis, John Lennon, visited DC, was America's first ping pong champion, an American philosophical slogan giver, and even a fit runner who ran across the country. He is the All-American guy. It made you feel you were there in 60s when we landed on the moon, when Richard Nixon robbed the Watergate, and when African-American were making the mark on America. However despite it's emotional and innocent events it had some moments like whe Jenny (god bless her soul even though she had done wrong) was a prostitute, when JFK, George Wallace, Lennon, and more were shot, and even when Forrest's mom had to sleep with a school principal so Forrest could make it in life brang out the dark and dirty points of our nation and leaves feeling a little guilty for how society is. This is why I only give ""Forrest Gump"" a 9. I still like when he says ""Big Bubblegum Shrimp"""
22756,False,"Hanks and Senise are brilliant along with the rest of the cast. From start to finish, most everyone will love this flick. I can't find fault with this movie, and I am shocked by some of the negative comments on this forum because it is a truly great film. I've watched this movie at least 10 times and I just love it. This movie is filled with all the emotions done with precision. Just sit back and enjoy it. In some ways it is so light on the outside and so profound in other ways. Gump is a wonderful movie for all ages and is so very deep. You will die laughing and also cry your eyes out. All you need is a pulse and you will love this movie for ever. 10 out of 10! One of the most memorable movies of all time."
22757,False,"The movie Forrest Gump is a very unusual, but a great, film. Each of the four story elements of characterization, plot development setting, and themes are very effectively presented. It was very popular when it first came out, and people even now still discuss it, considering it as a modern classic. In the first eighteen days, it took $100 million in only American cinemas, more than any other film made by Paramount Pictures before. The movie was first written as a novel by an American author Winston Groom. The movie was made in 1994, directed by an American director Robert Zmeckis.The story has an odd setting. It is set in a small fictional town in Alabama, but also the whole world. The filmmaker used this to represent his theme of 'everyman'. It has a long time setting. The story covers several generations from 1950s to 1990s. By covering of the world's time of losing innocence, as at the same time presenting Forrest as a symbol of innocence, he shows how the world has changed during the time.The main character Forrest is an extraordinary person. He, played by Tom Hanks, is born with polio. He needed braces for his legs when he was young. He also has a low IQ of 70. He is unusual. He is different from other people in a lot of special ways. Forrest Gump represents all Humanity, as a kind of modern-day 'Everyman'. He is judged by his intelligence and appearance by other people. This leads to another theme of the story. Judging a person by one thing about them cannot explain the person. The filmmaker uses this astonishing character to show the viewers the surrealism. The events go under realism, but all the things that happen to him cannot happen to one person. This intentionally unrealistic characterization is used to give us the message that we are all human.Other characters are also very interesting. His mom Mrs. Gump, played amazingly by Sally Field, tries really hard for him to find the best of him. She is willing to do anything for Forrest, and she always stands up for him. She symbolizes good motherhood. Forrest's beautiful girlfriend named Jenny, also his first and the only friend in the school, later becomes his wife. She was the victim of physical and sexual abuse by her father when she was young. Her childhood was like living hell for her. In the film played fantastically by Robin Wright, Jenny plays one of the major roles in the movie, contributing to the plot development and the theme of acceptance and tolerance.The mood of the film changes as Jenny comes to find Forrest, and then just leaves him alone again. The film slowly develops its high points. The first day of school is one. It is important because it shows that even little kids judge him by his looks. Later he goes to Vietnam and gets involved in the war. When he runs the entire breadth of America, the plot reaches one of its highest points with some humor in it.There isn't only one theme in the film Forrest Gump. ""Life is like a box of chocolate,"" he says. You don't know what you're given, until you've opened your chocolate. Additionally, whatever you're given in life, you should always try to achieve your personal best. It also makes the viewers wonder about the idea of destiny and choices in life. The film has a universal theme of acceptance and tolerance. He says, ""Stupid is as stupid does."" He might not fully understand what he's really saying, but the filmmaker intends the viewers to understand. It really means that it is not stupid to be unintelligent, but it's stupid to judge people on actions, not reputation, and to name-call them. The film tells us what it's really like to be a human. It expresses another universal experience of how we're more alike than not alike.Overall, I would say this movie is terrific. It doesn't only tell us about its themes and meaning of life but make us think about them as well. Both the actors' incredible performances, and the stimulating script writing make this movie so magnificent. The movie has won 6 Academy Awards including best picture. I strongly recommend you watch this movie and or read the original novel. It is important to understand what it's like to be a human, what it's like to be different, what it means to accept and understand each other and I'm sure you'll really like the movie too."
22758,False,"In all fairness and all clichés and preachy political statements aside, Forest Gump is an extremely watchable film on a basic level. If you just see it as a straightforward biographical story, then director Robert Zemeckis really gets you involved in the main character throughout his life. It features comedy, a war story, portrayals of eras, issues of acceptance and tops it off with a romance story--all supported by mostly strong performances and a fantastic soundtrack. However, when you scratch the surface of some of these things--and sometimes you don't even have to--you see the many issues that the film attempts to tackle and they are so many and so stupidly treated that it really ends up a babble of political correctness. AIDS, prostitution, racism, war, drugs and conformity are all touched upon at various stages of Forest's life as he experiences them like the innocent child that he is. The treatment of some of these issues is offensively moralistic and perpetuates and facilitates the holier-than-thou moral high-ground that Zemeckis takes in the film. Example: Forest fights in Vietnam war. Forest denounces war. Forest makes best friends with an African American guy. Forest won't take drugs. Forest helps bitter handicapped guy. Forest has a sincere mind. The only remotely rebellious character in this film is killed off with AIDS.Or maybe I'm simply too cynical to truly enjoy Forest Gump and its preachy optimism and 'fine-and-dandy' attitude. Either way, this film is obnoxiously politically correct but still quite enjoyable. 6/10"
22759,False,"This movie manages to get the idea of the book and some of the episodes, but completely misses the tone, which was dark and cynical. Imagine Candide being made into a Lifetime movie and you get the idea.Tom Hanks is fine (although actors get a little too much credit for playing mentally-challenged individuals - a bigger challenge would be Einstein, Leonardo, or like Tom Hulce, Amadeus Mozart). Some of the better, more fantastic parts of the book are completely left out. One in particular involves Forrest's being stranded on a Pacific island following the crash of his spacecraft (he is an Astrophysics savant). Would've been great. This movie cried out for a director like Terry Gilliam, but it got hackmaster Z. Oh well. It wouldn't hurt so much if it hadn't won best picture and best actor(!?!?!)."
22760,False,"I never knew how low the Academy could stoop when bestowing the coveted ""Best picture"" award when it chose to do so for the movie, Forrest Gump. It is a movie celebrating mental retardation and toss in some Frank Capra of ""Its a wonderful life"" fame and the mantra, ""you're never a failure if you have friends"" and you get the fabulously contrived piece of cinematic drivel that is, Forrest Gump. This film is rarely talked about these days, matter of fact, you never hear it mentioned AT ALL. It's become the most forgotten ""Best Film"" Hollywood has ever produced! Sort of ironic when you think about it because a best film award should entitle a movie to some longevity on the shelf. But no. This crappy piece of celluloid demonstrates more the short term memories of the American people as they the were the ones who seem to identify most with the character of Forrest Gump. This intellectually stunted individual is celebrated as the pure embodiment of American ""innocence."" How pathetic! You have been warned. Please, don't support movies of this ilk. It belittles your claim to being a lover of cinema when you love such trash."
22761,False,"There must be a lot of Forrest Gump types who vote on this web-site, because this has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. I saw this movie in the theatre, and my wife and I kept turning to each other and wondering what everyone thought was so funny about this movie. I remember one line from this movie, and it's not the one that everyone else remembers. ""Stupid is as stupid does"", that's just how I felt after this movie, when I realised that I just wasted 6 bucks on this piece of crap."
22762,False,"At the beginning of the movie we see Tom Hanks about to kiss a girl for the first time before his tiny weiner is exposed. In this movie, Tom Hanks does pointless, stupid things, then reacts with screaming, Hitler-like tantrums whenever his own actions start to boomerang and hit him in the behind.Since his first appearance on TV, Hanks forced his sick sense of humor onto the poor unsuspecting audience. Is this what you call entertainment? Do comedians not have any obligations to the public? How are Hanks's so called entertainment pieces helping any of us be a better person? I find it hard to answer these questions.On a related note, I find Hanks incredibly ugly and can hardly bear to watch him on screen let alone enjoy his ""work"". Besides, as he plays the same role in every movie with the same old ""jokes"" rewinding over and over again, watching one of his movies is just enough to guess the others.Before I wrote this comment, I watched additional Hanks movies, might I add, with disgust. And I confirmed my diagnosis: Stay away from Hanks movies."
22763,False,"I would give this movie a negative 10 if I could. It was one of the few movies I've ever seen that I absolutely HATED. There are a lot of movies that are bad, but I don't ""hate"" them. This movie I absolutely detest. Nothing about the movie is believable. Some people have told me, and some of the reviews say that it's not meant to be real, but viewed as a fable. It doesn't work on that level either.I've read reviews that said they rarely cry at movies, but this one had them bawling. I'm the opposite, I often easily cry at movies, but the only emotional feeling this movie left me with was relief it was over. There was no emotional attachment to any of the characters.The real kicker is that this film won best picture and best actor over ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and Morgan Freeman. At least the overall IMDb readers got it right. TSR is the best movie of all time."
22764,False,"Before I came to this site, this movie was my all-time favorite movie. But since then I saw many movies that changed my whole perspective of movie making, and truly many changed my life (in the way I should live and think) - so I grow apart from Forrest. Before a month or so I was in class and we had a discussion about a man's will's and boundaries. It came to me in a surprise to see on the TV screen an example of the discussed subject - I saw Forst run. Why did he ran? He doesn't know, he's just running - but people found meaning to his acts and ran with him - and he changed their life's. I felt like crying. I feel like crying. ""Forrest Gump"" as a truly great, deep and emotional look of life. It tells us a story of a great life but accidentally breaks our hearts. It's full of hope and happiness but with a lot of sadness. It may not be the greatest film of all - But it never meant to be... It is just a tale of a man named Forrest, Forrest Gump."
22765,False,"There's absolutely no doubt this is just a masterpiece. Tom Hanks is a genius, and a incredible actor(my favorite one). The simplicity of a man is take to a whole new level. I just think this is one of the best movies ever.The Script is flawless, incredible, the way it takes U.S.A history and adapt it to a simple mentally retarded man of the south it's just overwhelming. The story is great, and it's so powerful it can take you to a whole new level of identifying with the character.Tom Hanks make one of the best if not the bes performance I've ever seen. and Liuetenant Dan it's another great actor. Incredible strong acting, I love also the photography. Probably one of the most flawless movies ever.Forrest Gump is definitively one of my (if not my) favorite movie of all time, it is emotionally very powerful. Very Complex and not easy going and very well done. Flawless performances I just love it. It's one of those classics that always stays in your mind. I give it a 20 out of 10"
22766,False,"In Philadelphia Hanks played a gay man dieing of AIDS fired because of his sexuality. It took courage to take the part and Hanks used to to open the heats and minds minds of many viewers. When I first saw Gump I thought it was sentimental and cloyingly sweet. After talking to a friend who works with the handicapped my impression changed. Underneath the sugar coating the movie presents the idea that if people with IQs below 90 wanted to they could get into the army (Gump would never have gotten into the army), be war heroes, start successful businesses and become rich. It makes believable the idea that these people need no help from the rest of us. Hanks is cute, beguiling and an altogether 'lovable little retard'. The image it presents of real handicapped people who struggle to get by in our world is callous and degrading."
22767,False,"Phew!  I gave this one two stars, just because some of the effects were quite good.  Other than that, I have to say, there is very little to like. Perhaps you have to be a baby-boomer to a really appreciate it.  I'm a buster myself, and I've never been able to understand the wodges of gooey praise that boomers like to pile on to this fetid piece of corn.Tom Hanks (whom I actually like) has to hold a record for the easiest Oscar in history.  How hard could it be to just belt out your lines in a flat monotone, without ever having to show any sign of comprehension or complex emotion?  Forrest Gump in love looks an awful lot like Forrest Gump confused, or Forrest Gump angry, as far as I can tell.  The members of the Academy are suckers for mentally disabled protagonists, but Hanks's Gump has neither the depth of Dustin Hoffman's Raymond (""Rain Man"") Babbit nor the extraordinary movements and expressions of Daniel Day-Lewis's Christy Brown.If, like me, you like to see ALL the Oscar winners, I suppose you'll have to endure Forrest Gump at some point in your life.  Otherwise, stay away!"
22768,False,"""Forrest Gump"" failed to ""grab"" me from the outset. I kept wondering throughout what was its point: are we to float through life like a feather, barely being able to comprehend its meaning? Nothing which transpired did I find uplifting or involving. Indeed, it was one of the longest, most tedious journeys I've taken in a film.  Its merits to me are its technology, and not much more."
22769,False,"Please understand that despite my summary, I did enjoy this clever film. There was a lot to like. However, little of the film seemed Oscar-worthy and it probably should not be in the IMDb top 250. I think this is a great case of a very good film that has been prematurely elevated to greatness.As far as the plot goes, with zillions of reviews on IMDb for this film, I won't even bother. The acting was very good, the special effects ranged from freakin' amazing (such as digitally removing Lt. Dan's leg--quite an achievement for 1994) to very, very poor (inexplicably, despite Forrest being expertly inserted in many scenes, the one with John Lennon was very sloppy and the seams were very, very obvious on the big screen). The negatives included a few problems with continuity (such as the happy face being supposedly invented by Gump in the late 70s--it had been around for nearly a decade already) and perhaps too much emphasis on episodes as opposed to story. Still, it's a very enjoyable film and one you can't help but like. But winning 6 Oscars?! It must have been a very, very slow year."
22770,False,"frankly speaking, given that an average Asian people person entrenched with conservative and Confucian ideology in comparison with Westerners in particular, i really sense somewhat awkward for not appreciating this movie way thoroughly although i truly consider it should be a glorious showdown of self-righteous high social status dudes versus underdogs advocated and mocked by fates or certain ""papacy"" when destiny displays a hideous face.as far as i am weightlessly concerned,tom hanks delivers an incredible portrayal of a veteran who unfortunately is a imbecile,meanwhile his slightly overbearing mother somehow manages to be impeccable and pushy despite the fact that her son happens to be physically and psychologically handicapped. all the tragical climax culminates when gump's little son was born and his overdosed wife passed away. you can clearly see the shock of middle-class populace wrestles with life and struggles to keep track with others pace,,however,i remain sort of suspicious why the general tempo and rhyme of the movie goes so smoothly and peacefully, i am also not able to totally understand the humor permeating throughout the whole movie,the genre of which to my knowledge belongs to unique Americanism.by no means to be offensive but it is destitute of emotive burst and spicy aggression which is vital to vivify the whole movie."
22771,False,"Most opinions have already seen the light of day here, so I'll be brief.As a middle-aged Brit who has had a relatively positive life, I positively loathed the premise on which this film was based - if you are good-hearted then you will triumph against adversity no matter what obstacles life throws into your path (with the subtext ""In America""). Sorry, it just ain't true, even in America. I'm afraid to say that I loathed the way that America took this message to its heart even more than I loathed the message.And I have always disliked the way the Academy often favours ""disease of the week"" performances (I always rated Ernie Hudson's performance as a similarly afflicted character in ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"" - why did that get overlooked?).But let me be fair. There is a short sequence where Gump tries to ask Jenny if his son is normal - maybe 20 seconds in total. Hanks' performance in this sequence is nothing short of phenomenal and, on its own, justifies his Oscar in this film, even if the rest of it is nothing special."
22772,False,"This was such a great movie, Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar, he was amazing! This movie has one of the best actors and actresses you can imagine! Robin Wright Penn, Tom Hanks, Sally Field, they're just so great, and the plot of the movie is so great, because their are people like that, and it's so true that that could happen, and it did happen. Like their were people like that in the 60's, 70's, and 80's, like when Robin's character gets A.I.D.S., that happens all the time, and when Mykelti's character dies in war, happens everyday, and when Sally's character dies from cancer, happens everyday. This movie is so true and just so great! I love it! Overall this movie is the best! 10000 stars :D"
22773,False,"This movie is one of Tom Hanks best performances. He plays Forrest Gump and he narrates his life about having a low IQ and meeting his love interest Jenny (Robin Wright Penn). This movie It chronicles Gump's experiences, by chance, with some of the most significant people and events in American history like Elvis Presley, JFK, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and service during the Vietnam War. Ulimately, he surprisingly makes huge accomplishments like being honorably discharged from the military and leading a healthy and successful lifestyle. It sends a strong message that even some people with low IQ could achieve the greatest in life. Forrest touched the lives of many people, without any idea what he is really achieving due to his low-IQ. Still, his successes like becoming a football star and saving the life of fellow soldiers are evidence of the superb acting, heartwarming events and awesome directing. There is spirit and humor in the film, which provides some comedy-relief to the turmoil of the 1960s. Overall, one of the best films in cinema history and certainly worthy of its Oscar wins. Grade A"
22774,False,"at its best. When blockbusters work they do so through creating an alternate universe near enough to find our emotions while effecting magical art, beauty and experience. Forrest Gump is a shining example of that clarity. Hanks' performance is so natural that no wheels can been seen turning, astonishing when compared to Rain Man, the several iterations of ""Of Mice and Men"", and a myriad other movies where low IQ individuals are portrayed. Hanks brings to Gump dignity and individuality that allows us to love him without sympathy for his condition. All the supporting actors play off this lead wonderfully, without exception. The result is a fantasy as heartfelt as any in my experience. A truly wonderful film."
22775,False,"(r#79)I would lie if I said that Forrest Gump isn't an extremely well made movie. From the acting, to the feel-good story, to the pacing, comic timing, and fantastic soundtrack, it is one of the best movies ever made. Tom Hanks is good as the titular character, and Gary Sinise and Robin Wright Penn make for a strong supporting cast. Robert Zemeckis' direction hits all the right notes. The movie is also visually beautiful. So why did I only give it a 7 out of 10? Well, as well produced, directed and acted as the film is, there is an underlying cynicism that doesn't work well with the movie's innocent and good-hearted nature. The ""heart-breaking"" scenes become more and more obvious and deliberate with each viewing. Don't get me wrong, this is a great feel-good story and I did love it when I was younger. Maybe I am just growing more desensitized to this kind of warm-hearted, mushy stuff. The problem probably lies more with me than with the film itself, but I still can't help but feel that Zemeckis was a bit too elaborate. There are scenes that, when you're re-watching the film, seem written specifically to make the audience crack up in tears. It borders on being manipulative, rather than letting the audience think for itself.The movie could have worked as a serious drama. I'm a sucker for movies about mentally challenged men and I loved both ""Sling Blade"" and the more obscure ""Den Enfaldige Mördaren"". In the former, Billy Bob Thornton delivered a total class act. He embodied his character, Karl, to the point where you couldn't possibly compare him to his role in, say, Bad Santa. In ""Den Enfaldige Mördaren"", Stellan Skarsgård was also utterly believable. But I just can't buy Hanks in this role, even if it's probably the one he'll be remembered for. Thornton and Skarsgård, in their respective roles, *were* their characters. They were as human and real as you and me. Hanks' performance is a pure live-action cartoon, a caricature of a mentally challenged man. He's just too goody-goody. Too pure of heart. Too goofy and lovable. He's a man with no dark sides, and as such he's completely unbelievable. I did laugh at Gump's cute lines and catchphrases. I did feel for him when he got bullied around and when he finally got the girl in the end. But I wonder if anyone actually bought Gump as a character rather than just ""Tom Hanks playing a mentally challenged guy"".Another problem is that the movie refuses to take any real risks. There is nothing controversial about the subject matter and nothing really inventive about the movie-making (although it is quite an achievement to fit an entire lifetime into a single film!) 'Gump' is not a movie that pushes the envelope in any way.This is still a very enjoyable movie and first-timers will probably love it. It took a lot of viewings for me before my strong feelings for it started to falter. On the surface, ""Gump"" is one of the best feel-good movies ever made. But if you read between the lines, it is a cynical and very elaborate movie, nearly manipulative, and specifically designed to make you laugh, cry and pay for repeated cinema viewings. At least Hanks and Sinise do their best."
22776,False,"There's something of a tradition in fiction of using the idiot savant to hold the mirror up to society and reflect its foibles. The figure of the Good Soldier Schweik was one I remember being introduced to in my early years at university. Forrest Gump is also a soldier for much of this picture's duration, but the satire is diluted to no more than a few bum and fart jokes in the presence of the great and the good.Maybe it's this evasiveness that caused this film to attract such a storm of criticism from the Left when it first appeared. Seven years on, it's hard to see the film's reluctance to take on biting social satire as something it deserved to be damned for. More likely, it's the film's unflattering portrayal of the counter culture of the sixties that made its baby boomer critics touchy. For the most part, it's a gentle and appealingly whimsical picture. Australian - and more particularly, Melbourne - viewers will recognize in it something of the spirit of Michael Leunig's cartoons. In keeping with this spirit is the one aspect of this film that could be regarded as controversial, which is its scepticism toward causes.
Tom Hanks is excellent. It says something about the rest of the world's stereotypes about American culture that one of America's biggest movie stars can hold the screen for hour after hour while remaining the most self-effacing of actors. There is charm and real emotion in his performance. If the film sometimes veers into sentimentality (and it does) it is not Hanks' fault. The film isn't a masterpiece. As I say, it does sometimes lapse into sentimentality, and it annoys me that, like Rain Man, it can't acknowledge disability without conferring on its disabled characters superhuman talents of one kind or another. And, as I'm sure others have pointed out, the trick shots involving Gump's encounters with various historical personages had already been done - to much sharper comic effect - by Woody Allen in Zelig. However, for me the film's greatest specific failing is that it doesn't do more with the character of Gump's love, Jenny, who doesn't do much more in this film than turn up every half hour or so and look beautiful. I thought there was scope there to explore the nature of their mutual dependence more deeply, and to illuminate both characters in the process. To some extent this does happen with the character of Lieutenant Dan, a nicely drawn character who provides the right sort of counterweight to Gump.I don't expect that I will want to see this film again and again, the way I keep going back to Leunig's cartoons, which have a kind of natural wisdom-in-innocence that Zemeckis' film sometimes visibly strains to achieve. It's not a film that particularly goes anywhere, not that it really means to. But, a little to my surprise, I did enjoy watching it."
22777,False,"""Forrest Gump"" is one of the rare cases of cinema's magic working more than in any other artistic medium. Everything is a visual delight and a triumph in the field of storytelling, from the cinematography to the editing, from Zemeckis' sober direction to an extraordinary lesson of acting from Tom Hanks, the movie IS the Best Picture of 1994, which is saying a lot, and one of the best American films.Every film tells a story, but a few of them have this capability to penetrate your hearts and engage your emotions like ""Forrest Gump"". There are no villains in ""Forrest Gump"", no room for negativity, the only adversity consists on the many obstacles that life puts on your path, and the only form of heroism relies on the ability to overcome these obstacles, and whether you succeed or fail, the point is to keep your faith on life, and find your own Alchemy to transform coal in gold. And Forrest Gump is the first to have overcome the handicaps that would have deprived him from a 'normal' life.The flash-back introducing sight of little Forrest with his legs' braces, hand in hand with Mama Gump (remarkably played by Sally Field) would be too tragic if the script didn't rightfully choose to adopt a more lighthearted tone by making Forrest Gump the privileged witness of his time, of a cinematic journey in American History, with every piece of this epic puzzle connected in a way or another to him. I will never forget my first impression from the Elvis Presley part, the first indication of what would be the life of Gump. Something too promising to be eternally stuck in these handicapping braces, and the laughs work as the patient build up to a rewarding climactic moment, the miracle scene or an overwhelming celebration of the triumph of human spirit.And from this miracle, Forrest Gump becomes the fastest man in the world, and starts one of the most exhilarating chain of events that ever enriched a character. This is the power of Forrest Gump, a character defined by the way he is, the way he talks, the way he loves, defined by the events he lived, by those he underwent, and those he influenced, by the people that helped and loved him and people he helped and loved. Not one-dimensional or dim-witted, Gump is one of the most memorable and fascinating characters that even graced the silver screen. Who can ever forget ""My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump""? Through his silent moments, gestures, speech mannerisms and Tom Hanks' unique talent to transcend his everyday look, Gump conveys the profundity of a character affected and affecting a world in constant change, mirroring Mama Gump's unforgettable 'chocolate box' catchphrase.And what an epic life for an epic era, Gump's talent launches his football athlete career, which gives him a ticket to college, from college to the Army, where he'll become a Ping Pong player before converting to shrimp fishing. Every achievement of Forrest Gump is due to someone he loves, starting with his Mama who traded her dignity to provide her son the best education, Jenny, his best friend whose unforgettable ""Run, Forrest Run"" will drain the miraculous force that would change his life. And his friend Bubba who'll indirectly provide the basis of Gump's fortune thanks to a simple promise. And whatever Forrest took, he gave it back, to his mother, to Jenny, to his best friend's memory, and to Lieutenant Dan, who thought he had to die in the field of honor, and learned the value of life from Forrest's unshakable friendship.That's why I don't get the criticism toward the film, as if Forrest Gump was a kind of liberal incarnation of the passive state of mind that guarantees happiness. Why do people feel the need to appear so smart, to consider a movie where someone got shot in the face accidentally, superior, and it's a fan of ""Pulp Fiction"" speaking here. Maybe, I've missed a point, but ""Forrest Gump"" is perfectly aware of its comedic mood that almost flirts with parody sometimes. Eric Roth's Oscar-winning script is a kaleidoscope of all the incarnations of America in people's imagery through a glorious succession of anecdotes involving entertainment, music, politics, Presidents, scandals, Vietnam War, following one of the greatest cinematic soundtracks : the Doors, Dylan, Hendrix  ""Forrest Gump"" is a wonderful voyage to Pop-Culture America! And the intelligence of the script is subtly hinted in some little details like when Forrest evokes his perfect integration in the Army. This is pure comedy gold without any forced laughs.And as there's no better comedy than a comedy with a heart, on that level, ""Forrest Gump"" is so lighthearted it's almost blinding. I guess this comes from Forrest's heart, so pure, so white, like the cinematic allegory of Voltaire's Candid. How fitting that his last job is gardener, which mirrors Candid's motto that whatever happens, ""we need to cultivate our garden"". Gump does cultivate his garden as a sort of dream-like presence in a very familiar universe, a dream we'd loved to reach and touch, something that floats in our minds like this beautiful feather floating on the sky. Men like Forrest Gump are oddities only made believable through the magic of cinema with no other meaning than to inspire something pure in us.This is why any attempt to rationally analyze ""Forrest Gump"" and discredit its success is representative of that loss of common innocence, this cynicism people disguise in lucidity and realism, unknowing that they fall in the same trap than those who ran with Gump thinking it had a meaning while Forrest Gump only ""felt like running"". Gump didn't necessarily choose his path, but he always followed his heart, his idea of love and friendship. ""I'm not a smart man. But I know what love is"". On that level, Forrest Gump was simply a goddamn genius!"
22778,False,"Just watched Forrest Gump again in a very casual way when I was actually watching a Korean sitcom. I already watched this movie several times before.Gump is below level IQ but he is happy in some degree. At least he could love Jenny although their relation is kind of complex. You can say it is fragile but deeply rooted in both hearts like nostalgic. You can say this movie is not a masterpiece but it is very touching. In 67th Academy Award, it is the winner against other four movies like the Shawshank Redemption and FW and AF. Either have strong advantages over Forrest Gump. But Gump is deeply rooted in the red soil of southern USA- this great continent. FW and AF or Shawshank can happen everywhere but Gump is irreplaceable because it tightly is associated with the history of USA!For some people, they can not find their true lovers but have to marry because of some pressures. Am I to be one of them sometime?"
22779,False,"To say that this is a bit of a masterpiece is the right thing to say.Start of with to say that ""Forrest Gump"" is one of my 10 favorite movies ever made, mostly because the film gives you a fantastic experience not out of the usual.Robert Zeckemis is a director with a big and nice heart and with he help this movie is getting to a big and good level.Tom Hanks are amazing, in the film he really knows how to play a role nice and effect, so i can say that he makes his best role her, Right here on his little bench, and eats chocolate, Mr. Gary Sinise makes his preforming good.Good Movie, Perfect Movie"
22780,False,"***Spoiler Alert*** Forrest Gump is one of the most impactive, respected and popular films of the 90's. Widely considered one of the best films o all time, and while this is very subjective, the depth of this film in itself should be enough to at least make people accept its brilliance. In case you don't know, Forrest Gump is in fact a symbol of America. The story follows the main character, who, while not being the sharpest nor most intelligent main character alive, still manages to somehow just do the right things, attain success, and always make the best of others... Don't get too excited now though, cause while we have the naive, well-meaning Forrest, for whom life isn't too serious, we've also get Jenny, who ends up as the opposite. A symbol of everything rotten within America. Don't get it wrong, she's not an antagonist, actually it's just the sad irony, that Forrest, who attains everything by luck and good intentions, Jenny, who has all the ordinary traits and possibilities which Forrest do not have, simply picks all the wrong choices. So much for the American Dream... While these two characters respectively journeys through the best and worst periods of the country, there's always a somewhat romantic relationship between the two, which of course has to result in a child. Forrest Gump deserves just as much attention as it got. Everything form acting to directing to filming is perfect, and while one could keep up the endless discussion bout which of it and Pulp Fiction deserved the Best Film Award, the outcome shouldn't bother too many... Incredibly intelligent and exciting film..."
22781,False,"Robert Zemeckis is a name Cinema Salutes. Reason? He has made remarkable films, that have always touched a chord. But, some people believe his Cinema is not good enough, and he ain't worthy enough for what he has achieved. Now I advocate to those anti-Zemeckis's, Watch 'Forrest Gump', and you would yourself become a fan of this man and take your words back.IMDb writes: 'Forrest Gump', while not intelligent, has accidentally been present at many historic moments, but his true love, Jenny, eludes him. Is this really the meaning behind this 1994-Blockbuster? I am a Cinema Devotee, and My Verdict on this film is: This is a film above words, my summary correctly copies that. It's a journey of a man left alone, it's his journey to Win his LOVE, and finally become a proud citizen.About 140 Minutes long, 'Forrest Gump' unfolds fearlessly. This is Robert Zemeckis's finest work to date. His cinema has never been so engaging before. Eric Roth's adapted screenplay provides liberties to it's historical HERO. Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump & Gary Sinise, as one of Forrest's important people in his journey, pack in performances, that can surely be described as, ""Tour De Force"". Robin Wright as Jenny, becomes the beauty of her time and brings in spontaneity in her character.On the whole, Easily One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made, to pseudo, that sentence in Caps, is an understatement."
22782,False,"About Forrest Gump... I'll only say that I cried like a baby when the movie ended and I'm not the type of person who cries whenever she sees a chick flick or a drama. Seriously, there are only like three movies that have made me cry and I mean real crying. This film has a soul and you can easily fall in love with the characters. With this movie I suffered, laughed and felt real tenderness towards Forrest. Sometimes I feel that Academy Awards winners are overrated but this movie deserved every award.Kudos, Tom Hanks It's a must see if you consider yourself a movie fan."
22783,False,"Tom hanks is just perfect guy for this role. i haven't seen many movie which has its heart and brain working towards the audience as this movie does. We left fooled, amazed and sad at times with the eventful life gump goes through. sometimes you feel hatred towards gump's slutty girl friend and sometimes you say its just fine.Forrest gump is a dumb head, hard fool and non practical guy for most the people inside and outside the screen. but then when the movie ends we keep thinking why we don't have a heart like that. which cares, not cunning, not judging people, not selfish.If you ask the story then its just a one liner. A good hearted man travels through the ups and downs of his life, but for him both means the same or none. camera keeps us engaged and direction is picture perfect. every one wants to be him. its no preaching but a lot of learning. its more a lesson than a movie but here the text book is the man himself.good work and keep it working this way. worth watching more than one time."
22784,False,"Well, i jus don't know wat to begin with when it comes to this particular movie, this is my first comment on IMDb and i wanted to start with this. I saw this movie very late in my personal DVD, n had no much expectations about it except my cousin saying its a great movie. And to be frank this one turned out to be my most favourite movie, and already i liked tom hanks and he became my most favourite actor after this. That says it all, great movie, great acting, n great everything. Life history of a person cant be said in a better way. Folks do watch this movie, don't miss it for anything.My rating is 10/10 for this. The best."
22785,False,"this in my opinion is the best movie ever to be made in Hollywood. the story of a guy with a below normal IQ and the wonderful things happened to him over his course of life moves you, inspires you, makes you cry makes you wanna laugh out loud it feels so real!!! i can watch it over and over again hundreds of times and still not get bored !! the story is so simple and the way it is narrated is wonderful i got tears in my eyes in the scene when jenny tells Forrest about his son and he wouldn't understand it!!! this film is one of those which tells you the value of simplicity and the successes that can be achieved by it!! life is like a box of chocolates u never know what ur gonna get . this is one film which gives you a different warm feeling in your heart each time you watch itan absolute must watch!!!"
22786,False,I loved the movie even though he was pretty much told the whole story by himself. He made himself seem as if the whole world is gonna be OK just the way it is. He goes threw a lot of different things but he gets through it. he is a sweet and caring guy who has no problem telling you what he feels. he would never lie or do anything to hurt anyone.this is an excellent movie if your trying to make a point u should definitely watch.very good inspiring movie.His life is a lot like others but he gets through the difficulties and loves everything even if it wasn't supposed to go down the way it so happened to. Tom Hanks did a phenomenal job on playing the role of forest gump.
22787,False,"One of the most inspiring movies I ever seen ! Forrest not only show us that ingenuity is a gift (I want mine back!) but decision is crucial in life, maybe his retarded condition private him from hesitation on important decisions, such a big advantage over the rest of regular ""intelligent"" people. While the film exaggerates a bit, Forrest with his initiative undertake and reach more goals and lives more intensively his life than the rest of average ""smarter"" men. By not having a life's vision, Forrest confront every challenge one for one doing his life an exciting playground, achieving more, doing more and helping others more, meanwhile most of us ""the normals"" are typecast in our boring routine. Who is smarter ?"
22788,False,"I have only seen this film once but once was enough for me. This film is a simple tale of goodness and light and how somebody can shine that light on those less fortunate. Religion is not involved here at least not in the conventional sense. The light is the sheer goodness of a person who clearly cannot do or say anything to offend anybody no matter how hard some people disrespect or try to offend them. In the case of the man in the title role this is not an attitude that he adopts to win favour or even artificial posturing in order to be popular, it is who he is. There are people out there who will feed on the mans positivity or goodness and hope by association to be renewed or to have some beneficial effect rub off on them. And so Forrest goes through life as if the world holds no surprises or perhaps everything is a surprise, so when they come along he just adapts without any fuss and just moves on. People like Forrest are rare indeed and the film which charts his life is uncomplicated and just lays it out for all to see. The entire cast and crew are to be congratulated on a very good job as the film in the wrong hands could have been a disaster. I would highly recommend anybody watch this film at least once, because for me it has a very simple message and is also very entertaining."
22789,False,No movie has touched me as much as Forrest Gump. At the end of the movie you really feel lucky to have seen this movie and would want to watch over and over again. Tom Hanks produced one of the best acting skill ever which made him win the Academy-Award which he truly deserved. If you are a real movie lover then Forrest Gump is the movie that you'll never regret watching. It's one of those movies which brings a smile on your face even when you are feeling low and lost hope. The best part is when he is standing on Jenny's grave and Forrest speaks his lines. Remember always that you are no different from others and can achieve what others have. I would give it a 10/10 DO WATCH IT.
22790,False,"For me it's one of the best movies I have ever seen. But I wanted to say something else. I've just read book (Forrest Gump of course) and I'm very impressed. This book is not as good as movie and I admire someone (Zemeckis? or somebody) who read it, removed sub-plots almost like from cartoon (spaceship, living in the jungle etc.), changed few things (meeting with Bubba, Dan), added (cross-country running, hint about Apple etc.) and made such a cool script. Finding book which is decent and changing it to Oscar-winning movie is something what I like. In opposite to few movies (i.e godfather?) when book is genius and it's just remade to movie (2 chapters removed is not much of work)."
22791,False,"I found this an entertaining movie to watch, nothing more, nothing less. I have one major reason for being negative about this film: it portrays a man who is able to attain the 'American Dream' without any intelligence. However much we can admire him for that, I'm afraid that the message being sent out is that you don't need education or smarts and that everything will come to you as if laid by a golden goose. Surely this is not what the movie makers intended but that's the way it came across on me.Besides that I must say that Tom Hanks does an excellent acting job, and for that alone the film is actually worth watching...but not a classic."
22792,False,"""Forrest Gump"" is a great movie, although some people say it is ""the greatest ever made"" and Tom Hanks' performance is ""the best ever"", quite the contrary, though (actually, not THE contrary).Forrest Gump is a quite remarkable film, but unfortunately, its cheesier than an extra-cheese pizza, and I found that Hanks' performance was a bit overboard, and the film is a bit silly. ""The Shawshank Redemption"", and ""Pulp Fiction"" were far better films, that lost to Forrest Gump. I found that that was quite bad. Sure, Forrest Gump is good, and fun, but it is nothing compared to Shawshank and Fiction. And Morgan Freeman, John Travolta, Nigel Hawthorne and others who gave remarkable performaces, but lost to Hanks' overblown one.Anyway, that's my 2 cents, Forrest Gump's good, but has a lot of errors, while Shawshank and Fiction were better, and didn't have many errors.""We blew it"" - Easy Rider"
22793,False,I must admit that I did not understand sadness in movies before this. This was truthfully one of the only movies that I would ever even feel sad at all. I've seen movies like Good Will Hunting and had no idea why people thought that was so sad but this is a great movie that is funny and makes you feel like you are there the whole time. I personally like this movie because it's the only kind of non horror or action film that I can actually get into. I recommend this to anyone
22794,False,"Forrest Gump could have been better, but it's good enough.In the first half hour I find the screenplay's a bit weak but then I get carried away by Zemeckis' creativity in bringing historical icons into Gump's simplicity. The music and the background are fantastic but somehow the acting from the casts don't impress me as much as they should. Nevertheless, overall it's the feel-good film of the year."
22795,False,"I like this movie very much. The first time I saw the movie, it was the french version. The movie was good but the voices were not so good. Then a saw the original version then I was surprised how much the movie was better. Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors in the present area, he won two Oscars in a row. All of the supporting actors made a great job too. Tom was marvellous in Forest Gump. I like the way Forest goes through modern American history. The story is presented is a funny way. We saw all the good and the bad mood America has go through. The music is also great."
22796,False,"Probably the best movie I've ever seen! Forrest Gump, along with Titanic(1997), will be an unforgettable movie, a classic. After watching the relatively long film, I couldn't get enough of it, I wanted more and more. I'm sure you'll feel the same feelings I had after the end. I would gladly see it once more, without being bored not even a second. I think that tells it all.Tom Hanks is an excellent actor. I wish he had earned his third nomination for best actor for Apollo 13. The next movie I'm watching is Saving Private Ryan.Thanks."
22797,False,"The rest of the comments in the comments section seem like they are talking about another movie. What does Forest Gump lack? Plot? Imagination? Originality? Excellent acting? By all means, none of those! Why should it be compared to The Shawshank Redemption, I can't comprehend. These are both excellent movies, but of a very different genre. Personally, I wasn't as touched watching The Shawshank Redemption, and never have I laughed as much as was moved in the same movie.Hanks' acting was the apogee of his career, not even outmatched by his role in Saving Private Ryan, which I loved, and consider the greatest war film of all time.The story is indeed eye-watering. An improvement of the novel. Behind the character of Forest Gump hides a philosophy.... An awe to the man who knew nothing yet lived them all.Merely, Forest Gump is a classic."
22798,False,"You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll just have a darn good time. Tom Hanks gives the performance of his career, one year after his other brilliant performance in Jonathan Demme's masterpiece Philadelphia. The supporting cast is flawless, and the soundtrack would have to be right up there with the Star Wars soundtrack as the best ever, including my personal favourite Creedence Clearwater Revival. Anyone who says this film only won Oscars because, like Rain Man it was about an idiot, has no idea what they are talking about. Citizen Kane may be the greatest film of all time on a technical level, and I do love it, but is it as magical as this film?I think not."
22799,False,I have lost count of the number of times I have watched this movie. I love the innocence of the character and how manages to frustrate you and make you love him at the same time. It never gets old for me.
22800,False,This movie impressed me a lot. Life lessons in a true amazing story. I will always recommend it to anyone.
22801,False,Forrest Gump 1994 is really a good show for two hours.You will not want your two hours back after seeing this film.It is just awesome.Though this film depiction is quite as comedy but that doesn't matters anyway.This film will give you hope.
22802,False,"If you want to understand Forrest Gump, you have to pay attention to all of the movie's characteristics. This wonderful film, directed by Robert Zemeckis, has a great cast on all levels, creating a perfect atmosphere to describe the journey of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks). It shows - in a singular way - significant historical and political events (such as the Vietnam War), cultural movements (like the hippies in the 70's) or important figures (such as Elvis Presley) to American history and culture.In the first scene, you could ask yourself: who is this guy? What would make this movie's story different from others? Well, you will see the world through the eyes of a mentally challenged man who has a different perception of life, people and love: Forrest is a pure heart. Because of him, we see an idealized vision of Earth that ignores grim social realities. However, at the same time, we realize that his perception of life has a powerful message: how evil and complex our society can be. It is not only about a different hero. If you are waiting for a conventional life story that does not require that you think outside the box, I would suggest another type of plot.The way that Forrest sees the world is a way of softening the strong American reality of Vietnam War, the oppressive educational system, and the prejudiced society which still exists and echoes nowadays. This happens in the Washington speech scene, when Forrest said: ""Sometimes when people go to Vietnam, they go home to their mommas without any legs. Sometimes they don't go home at all. That's a bad thing. That's all I have to say."" Unfortunately, the microphones were turned off when he was speaking these words. Other moments also call our attention to important points or personalities of American culture. For example, one of the running scenes, in which a prison chain gang works as a background to Forrest's adventures and he inspires John Lennon to compose ""Imagine"" based on his point of view of China.This modern fable, full of a singular, direct and true simplicity of a man and his memories will keep you on the edge of seat. Forrest Gump needs to be seen between the lines. In the first moments you will not believe in his pure heart. However, it makes all the difference when we are watching this movie. 
If life is a box of chocolates that you never know what you are gonna get, you will not be disappointed with his stories and all the meanings expressed by this movie through photography, soundtrack, visual effects, easter eggs etc. Besides all that, the film won, in 1995, six Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director (for Robert Zemeckis), Best Actor (for Tom Hanks), Best Adapted Screenplay (for Eric Roth), Best Film Editing, and Best Visual Effects. It should be seen by everyone. A classic movie, due to its technical production and its messages to the viewer. I truly recommended it."
22803,False,It is a flawless film. Every scene has been well thought before filming and the execution is perfect. Robin Wright plays the layered character effortlessly. Tom Hanks is awesome and I am sure that no one else could have Forrest Gump like him. He runs and talks in a beautiful way. You devolop a liking for this character almost immediately. While telling the story of Forrest Gump this movie also tells us the story of United States of America and pays tribute to the most celebrated celebrities and heroes of those times.
22804,False,Forrest Gump is a wonderful film that has all the essence of 90's masterpiece. From the delightful chimes by Alan Silvestri to the marvellous performance from Tom Hanks. Everytime I catch the film it has me settled and glued.
22805,False,"Calling Forrest Gump may be saying a lot, but there is nearly impossible to deny the astounding talent roaring in front and behind the camera. Robert Zemeckis, a filmmaker with a heavenly gift of storytelling, take his talent to the fullest extent with this heartwarming, charm-fueled tale focuses on the eponymous fighting to find his place in the complex world many people struggle to understand. This movie, unraveled from the pages of the screenplay by Eric Roth, lightens the flame with cinematic mastery with storytelling that blends landmark American history with a timeless tale of a misunderstood man with the heart of gold. When you are supposed laugh, you will laugh. When you are supposed to cry, your eyes will get soaked; and that is only half of the beauty that makes this adaptation of Winston Groom's novel of the same name a triumphant piece of cinematic glitter. So this film stars Oscar- winner Tom Hanks as, yours truly, Forrest Gump, a forty-something year old Alabama man who suffers a low IQ but nonetheless carries a gentle soul. Providing the framework of the story is Forrest sitting on the park bench as he tells his story to various individuals of his life from his childhood, to his adult life where he caught in the middle of America's landmark moments including the meeting with President John F. Kennedy, to his tour in Vietnam where he forms friendship with his squadmate Lieutenant Dan (played by Gary Sinise), to the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. While caught up a series of political unrest that ran rampant during the 60s and 70s, he finds himself distracted in his pursue for his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran (played by Robin Wright) who's life is in shambles, while reflecting his life choices all of the wisdom of his mother (played by Sally Field). This movie never takes its chances to pull at our heart strings for granted, but never does so in a way that feels hammy or exploitative. It is a film with that almost always has its heart in the right place while gently feeding you the message of in the world full of darkness and despair, there is always an underlining humanity resting somewhere within. Forrest in particular, wins our hearts with his heartwarming personality as he ventures through key moments in America's history while refusing the let go of the woman dear to his heart. Each scene following Forrest in the midst of the political tension including the Vietnam War, the ill-fated JFK administration is handled with maturity with an underlining dose of snappy charm. Flowing with an uproar of social commentary without slapping the story with a bias agenda, it is satisfying to see Robert Zemeckis prevail his effort in balancing a compelling story with a sweet batch of swift history lessons. Of course, the romantic drama is the brighter star in the story. The separation between him and Jenny transpires to moments of both bittersweet and melancholy, and the emotional chemistry really grabs at the heart, especially in the beginning when we get a sad inside look at her childhood at the hands of her abusive father. And thanks to Tom Hanks and Robin Wright, the romantic affinity between them works gracefully. Robin Wright plays her role with plenty of humility to prove her talent as an actress. However, this comes less of a surprise than Tom Hanks who tackles on what may be the most triumphant role of his career. Hanks plays the title character, a man with a mental disability that requires a kind of performance that could have easily come off as mawkish and ham-fisted. Luckily for a talented actor he is, his performance is blisteringly top-notch with moments that effectively show the down-to-earth nature of his character. He is the ultimate reason why his chemistry with not only Robin Wright, but his friend Gary Sinise as the well-acted Lieutenant Dan works well. Forrest Gump is a triumphant slice of cinematic art blooming with a a career-defining performance by Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis working at his prime with a cinematic piece that is simply timeless, if not a masterpiece. For a movie that was predicted to be a critical and commercial by many prior to its release, it is definitely one hell of a sleep hit. I guess it comes to show that Forrest's mother was right when she said ""life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get."""
22806,False,"""My momma always said, ""Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.""Forrest Gump tells a powerful, touching story. It makes us ponder the reality of how the way life is. Whether, our lives, are predestined -- everything happens for a reason; vice versa. I need not to say anything regarding the plot, that the synopsis doesn't tell perfectly already. This is a must see for anyone, if you haven't already. Heck, see it again if you're familiar with the novel or the movie. Bring popcorn, and tissues."
22807,False,"Epic in scope and triumphant in spirit, Forrest Gump is a larger- than-life piece of film-making, that scored home an impressive 6 Oscars in 1995, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor in a Leading Role. It revolves around the eventful and remarkable life of a mentally, and for some time physically challenged man, who looks at the world through very unique and innocent eyes, as he becomes part of some of the key events that shaped America as a nation. Famous historical figures like Elvis, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon and John Lennon, are just some of the people that he encounters on his grand and amazing journey. Director Robert Zemeckis is a magician behind the camera, delivering world-class visual story-telling that truly captures the heart and mind in really spell-binding ways. So much love and passion have gone into its making, and it's one of those rare cinematic miracles, where all parties involved have dedicated themselves fully to create the best experience possible. Ascended by a beautifully orchestrated music score (together with some great classics from the eras it portrays), it hits all the right notes at all the right moments. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll maybe even feel inspired. For there's nothing in this tour-de-force of a film that isn't absolutely stirring. It's been almost 20 years since its release now, yet the special effects still hold and look as fantastic as ever. They way they've integrated Forrest into real historical footage, is incredibly well- done and nearly seamless in its crafting. Some things even look more convincing than the wizardry of modern features. However visually compelling it may be though, it's in the acting where it truly dazzles. Tom Hanks' sensational, award-winning performance, is definitely one of the best, if not the greatest of feat his entire career. I would say it stands between this and his heart-gripping turn as an AIDS victim in Jonathan Demme's Philadelphia. You certainly can't complain about the supporting cast either. Sally Field, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise and Mykelti Williamson, evoke tremendous pathos and sympathy, with their exceptionally written and terrifically acted characters. Michael Conner Humphreys is really wonderful as well, as Forrest in his younger years. Cynics may have issues with how far-fetched the story is, but I don't think it matters much in the larger perspective. I'm more than willing to suspend all disbelief, for such a majestically conceived and viscerally powerful piece of drama. And I'm sure that goes for a lot of us. A movie about love, loss, war and human behavior. About discovering your inner potential and overcoming your limitations, even when everything seems against you and absent of hope. For within Forrest Gump dwells a ray of pure inspiration, with the message that life is what you make of it. We may not all come to shake hands with the President or amount to champions in ping-pong, but we all possess the power to make the best of what we have. Timeless, magical, moving and uplifting, this movie is a celebration of all that and more!"
506800,True,"Many movies try and fail at being one genre. Forrest Gump succeeds in multiple genres and it shows from the very beginning of the movie. The fact that i watched this movie as a kid and then as an adult and enjoyed it even more is a testament to phenomenal writing. The subtle nuances of Forrest Gump's life totally flew over my head as a child. Seeing this movie as an adult is almost like seeing it for the first time again. I understood and felt for Forrest's mother within the first 2 minutes & learned to love Lt. Dan on New Years. I won't spoil much but in that moment on New Years eve, i believe we got our first glance into how aware Forrest actually is & it's heartbreaking to see him go through that scene but heartwarming to see Lt. Dan stand up for his friend. This movie deserves a 200 page essay on it's greatness so any review will never do it justice. If you have not watched it yet...strap in for a roller-coaster of emotions and laughs."
506801,True,"Best movie I've ever seen in my life, very inspirational, motives people pursuit their dreams.No matter where you come from live is a roller-coaster of emotions, but also full of pos and downs. If someone could make it to the top you could also do it with tons of work and a clear vision of your goals in life. The actors role was perfect for the character he had on the movie."
506802,True,"Forrest Gump is a movie that everyone must watch as it reveals an accurate chronology of all the important events in the history of the United States. A good knowledge of American History helps to identify profound ideas that further strengthen the audiences idea of the movie. The story plot is developed through a series of life lessons that changes the character into being a more responsible and mature adult. The Story revolves around Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks) who is often bullied for his leg brace and his egregiousness in society. This compassionate young boy falls in love with Jenny(Robin Wright) from a very young age. One of the key points in the movie is when Forrest joins the military where the director(Robert Zemeckis)accurately portrays the mixed feelings everyone had about the Vietnam war and the consequent events that pursued after it such as the Watergate Scandal. The movie teaches a lot about the essence of American History and the events that have shaped modern society today. The story depicts an accurate representation of the rural setting and the challenges that each character had to face due to their background, identity and ethnicity. Overall, the movie is a must watch for every American and those who wish to learn the importance of American history and its implication on their lives today."
506803,True,"Such an amazing movie with an incredible performance by one of the most talented actors of our generation, Tom Hanks. This motion picture takes us on a journey throughout specific and emblematic dates of the north American history accompanied by top musical hits of those times. Together with a great production, Robert Zebecks brings us what is considered a masterpiece of the 90's, Forrest Gump the ""6 Oscar winner feature film""."
506804,True,"The movie Forrest Gump, directed by Robert Zemeckis, released in 1994, is a highly awarded movie, though despite its praise it wrongfully only received a 71% rating on rotten tomatoes. This movie takes place mainly in Alabama between 1944 through 1982. Through the eyes of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a man with an IQ of 75. Despite Forrest's low intelligence, he's able to overcome that by being apart of many historical events. The movie shows pieces of these events such as Elvis Presley's appearance on TV, John F. Kennedy's murder, George Wallace's murder, the Vietnam war, hippie culture, the moon landing, John Lennon's murder, the aids breakout of 1981, and many other historical events that took place from 1944 to 1982. This movie is loved by many as it can appeal to a wide range of people with the use of genres, its quotability, the advanced editing, and the amazing acting by Tom Hanks.While many movies will fall under the genre categories of comedy, action, romance, etc., Forrest Gump doesn't have just one set genre. Forrest Gump includes many aspects from different genres making it appeal to a wider range of people. It includes genres such as epic, action, drama, romance, and comedy. According to stardust, ""the statistics portal"", ""Films within the comedy, adventure, action and drama movie genres generated the most box office revenue"". Creating a film the falls under the four most popular genres is incredibly smart because it is likely the film will have something in it to appeal to nearly everyone. One main point this movie shows is that someone can make a difference no matter who they are or what their intelligence level is. It's important that this point doesn't just discuss one type of person but that anyone, no matter who they are or their intelligence is can make a difference.Since this movie has been released it has been quoted in daily conversations, thanks to the amazing writing done by Winston Groom. It has also been referenced in more movies and TV shows than I can count. One of the most quoted lines from the movie would be, ""My mama always said, 'Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.'""-Forrest. This quote was voted as the #40 movie quote by the American Film Institute. I think this quote really stood out as everyone knows life is a mystery. Even if you think you've planned everything things are going to come around and change that. Although Forrest didn't really have his life all planned out many things came about that quickly changed his course. He was simply handed a flyer to apply for the U.S army, which immediately led to a scene of him finding a seat on the bus that took them there. Having been given this flyer led to him enlisting in the army which led to him becoming a ""war hero"" which led to many other things and great opportunities. Despite the unlikelihood of all of these events happening to one single person, we all know that life is unpredictable.Forrest Gump's special effects were outstanding for the time it was made. The special effects team on this film won an Oscar for the editing of the movie and even created a new term called ""gumping"" as they were able to place Tom Hanks' character in the previously recorded historical footage. The special effects team used CGI to edit Tom Hanks face over people who were actually there. They were then able to edit any other hand and arm movements. The editing in the film allowed Forrest to meet John Lennon, John F. Kennedy, and Richard Nixon. Often times these characters would be shown talking to Forrest Gump but obviously that couldn't have happened so they used voice-overs to make it seem like the conversations were actually taking place. The amazing special effects team on this film won an Academy Award for Best Film Editing. Another aspect of this film that made it so great was Tom Hanks portrayal of Forrest Gump. When they first started filming they wanted Tom Hanks to have an eased southern accent but the little boy who played young Forrest had naturally thick southern accent that was hard for him to change. So the director talked to Tom Hanks and they decided it would be best if Tom Hanks changed his character's accent to match the boy's natural accent. Tom Hanks spent hours sitting around talking to and recording the boy talking to try to match it perfectly. Having put in the extra effort to match the accents showed how dedicated Tom Hanks was as, in the end, it's completely believable that the boy just grew up and his accent stayed. John Travolta was the original choice to portray Forrest Gump but I am so glad he turned it down as I can't imagine anyone else playing Forrest Gump. The extra effort the Tom Hanks put into this movie doesn't just show through the accent but also through his amazing acting skills and his believability.The movie Forrest Gump got a very underrated score on rotten tomatoes, but I think it deserves much better as it was an amazing film that took the audience through historical events through the eyes of a man with an IQ of 75, but in the end his IQ didn't really matter as he was able to accomplish so much that the average person wouldn't even dream of. With the use of genres, its quotability, the special effects, and the amazing acting by Tom Hanks this movie has won many awards including six Oscars."
506805,True,"Forrest Gump is short on I.Q. points but has a very big heart, a pure and simple soul who follows a straight path through the world, ever true to the homely advice of his mother - the source of guiding ""Stupid is as stupid does"" - and to his elusive lifelong love Jenny (Wright). He begins his serendipitous skirmishes with destiny in childhood by unconsciously giving ideas to the as yet unknown Elvis Presley, and goes on to become, unintentionally, a football star, war hero."
506806,True,"What I like about the film is that it blends the tragedy and the comedy, and the film has a cultural, and historical aspect. It tells us many historical events that coincided with Forrest's life in a quasi-comic way. I think Tom Hanks is the right actor for this performance. The strange thing is that Forrest has participated in these events and has had an impact on the course .."
506807,True,"Definitely it is one of the movies that could clearly watch the talent and the professionalism of acting by Tom Hanks,, No doubt it is one of the Oscar movies and we may not be able to see such performance again for decades.. Also the direction was excellent from my point of view the ranking 12 should be raised to be in the top five movies ever."
506808,True,"This movie is my fourth favorite movie ( 3: American Graffiti, 2: Titanic, 1: Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End ). This movie has a great message about race, War and family ( that sounded a little cheesy didn't it ). This movie is like a box of chocolates. You never know what's going to happen to Forrest. In the movie, Forrest meets three Presidents of the USA, fights in the Vietnam war, plays collage football, plays the world champion of table tennis, creates the shrimping company "" Bubba Gump "", and invests in a little computer company called Apple 😉."
506809,True,This movie will seriously always be a classic. A lot of people have a misconception about this movies. But let me share this with you. Ones you watch this movie you will want to watch it over and over and over. Okay what else to say ? Funny funny funny funny funny . The minimum lines in this review is five lines wow.
506810,True,"I don't really want everyone to like this movie. It is very horrible, the film is boring, it is too upsetting and it is definitely not funny and a HUGE waste of time.Screw this piece of garbage! Forrest Gump should also have won Golden Raspberry Awards instead of Academy Awards. This is the wrong movie to win Academy Awards! Plus, all the genres listed on IMDb are completely incorrect! Somebody should remove the Comedy genre and replace it for the History genre instead, because this looks like a historical film than a comedy film."
506811,True,"One of the funniest movies to me period. I love the great scenaries with Gump he a great actor. Only perhaps his character can sometimes causes a dramatic feeling but overall great movie!!!I also love the part when he like run Forrest run and he's slowly making effort I feel that this movie is a generational movie that should be introduce in the youth and upper comings. Like they say history wouldn't be the same without Forrest ""Forrest Gump"" spans some 30 years and touches on many important chapters in U.S. history, including the Vietnam War, the '60s anti-war movement and the Watergate scandal. Along the way Forrest encounters a young Elvis Presley and three U.S. presidents and even appears to inspire John Lennon's ""Imagine"" when he meets the ex-Beatle on a talk show. Some teachers have shown the movie in high school classrooms as a jumping-off point for discussing the '60s and '70s. Many believe adapted liberally from Winston Groom's novel, is not meant to be taken literallyAlthough ""Forrest Gump"" beat ""Pulp Fiction"" for the 1994 best picture Oscar, many film scholars rate Quentin Tarantino's film -- with its vivid antiheroes, nonlinear plot and pungent dialogue -- as the better movie. ""Pulp Fiction"" and its gallery of colorful criminals didn't stand a chance of winning top honors at the Oscars that year. But Tarantino's brash movie inspired countless imitators. If you ask a film critic to list the most influential movies of the 1990s, you probably won't hear them mention ""Forrest Gump.Forest Gump"" blends drama, comedy, reality and fantasy into a genre-busting saga that almost defies description. It shouldn't work, but it does. Its scenes, and lines, are indelible to many of us: ""Run, Forrest, run!"" ""I gotta pee."" ""Stupid is as stupid does."" ""That boy sure is a running' fool!"" ""I'm sorry I had to fight in the middle of your Black Panther party."" ""There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp ..."" The list, and ""Forrest Gump's"" legacy, goes on and on. And that's all we have to say about that."
506812,True,"I'v seen just about every Robert Zemekas movie and I enjoyed only three of them. Flight,Back to the future, and of course Forrest Gump. This is his best movie and Tom Hankes best work. Its a serious movie but at times is very funny and will make you cry throughout. It tells the story of a mentally cjallenged man who achieved lots in life . He fought in nam, was a world class ping pong player, and ran continuously for over two years. The movies two and a half hours but to me its worth every minute of it."
506813,True,"Forrest Gump is a great movie. I doubt you're reading these reviews at this point to try to figure that out. It is deeply inspiring, if a bit too saccharine at points. The story it tells is uplifting, and the film blends archival footage with new stuff masterfully.The movie does tend to be a bit of a Grand Tour of Baby Boomer cultural touchstones, not that that is necessarily a bad thing! Forrest Gump has long been my movie to reinforce my faith in the universe and humanity itself, and Forrest is one of my all-time favorite characters to ever grace the silver screen. To (mis)quote the famous line, this movie is like a box of chocolates, except with this one, you always know what you're going to get.(I have seen this before, most recently on May 13, 2017)"
506814,True,"Tom Hanks has been an integral part of the films and he keeps the audience engaged. One of the most amazing American movies ever made. A brilliant tale of the American Dream narrated by a simple man with simple pleasures. Hanks is at his stunning best here, and Zemeckis proved that he's more than just a technological wizard when it comes to making movies. A classic that deserves to be adored for decades to come."
506815,True,"I was deeply moved by the beautiful and pitiful girl. Although she was sexually molested by her father in her childhood，she still encourage Forrest and love him because she take Forrest for a pure person and feel deeply self-abased for what her experience. How beautiful girl she is!She never look down upon Forrest!Unfortunately,she meet too many setbacks in her life.However,in my opinion,Falling in love with Forrest is the biggest happiness in Jenny's life"
506816,True,Forrest Gump is an excellent movie to watch. I enjoyed the movie very much. There were hilariously funny scenes that made me laugh uncontrollably and there were those sad scenes that made me realize how much family means to me. I would completely recommend this movie as a must-see for friends and family. This movie was very inspiring. I would love to see friends and family watch and enjoy this movie.
506817,True,"Aknowledging that Tom Hanks(Forrest Gump) is an amazing actor, this movie is very splendid, especially with his skills. As Freddy Mercury says in his song, ""The Great Pretender"": ""Too real is this feeling of make believe Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal"" Which is exactly what Gump can't conceal, he can't hide his love for Jenny."
506818,True,"This is one of my favorite ""coming of age"" films. From the way the films toys with historic events to the soundtrack, I am mesmerized! The cast is so enjoyable to watch. I was so excited to introduce this film to my daughters. Every time this movie is on, I watch it. Please don't do a sequels!!! But, a remake would be kind of fun...."
506819,True,"I usually watch horror or action films but as a family we decided to watch this. I really thought it would be dreadful because its romance. But I was completely wrong I honestly think no I know it is the best film I have watched yet.The way it is told is so original and it works so well. The characters are all different giving you at least one person to relate to which I think is important to have. It is such a sad story though and really touching escpecaily between forest and jenny. It is so clever how they get you to know what is happening without showing you. Like the time forest says, her daddy is so kind, he is always hugging and kissing jenny. In the film you can tell she is being child abused and even raped."
506820,True,"Released in 1994, Forrest Gump is an American comedy-drama film. it was based off of a 1986 novel of the same name by Winston Groom. in that year, it became the top grossing film in North America. in 1995, it won the academy awards for best picture, best director for Robert Zemeckis, best actor for Tom Hanks, best adapted screenplay for Eric Roth, best visual effects, and best film editing. Plot: Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a slow but caring individual that achieves greatness in every situation that he's in. he effects many people in his life with his optimism and changes lives wherever he goes.Forrest Gump is an amazing movie for many reasons. i would say that one of the biggest reasons has to be Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump. in every scene that Tom is in, it feels completely real. it never felt like you were watching a movie, but you were instead listening to a real person talk about their real beliefs and their real problems. every scene felt truly authentic. another things that makes this movie great is that it puts the main character into real historical events such as the Vietnam protests or the Watergate scandal. it not only provides good comedy, but it also makes it feel like Forrest exists in the same world that the viewer does instead of feeling like he's just existing in a movie version of Alabama. the greatest thing for me however, has to be the structure. because of how Forrest Gump takes place in flashbacks going from young to old, it felt like the viewer lived Forrest's life with him and got to understand the complexity of him. it truly made the movie much better.Overall, i Think that Forrest Gump is the perfect movie. it's funny, dramatic, and heartwarming all at the same time."
506821,True,Tom hanks is so great in this film and he brings so much to his character. His chemistry with all of the other characters is great as well. It is so sad when his mom and bubba dies. You can see how torn up he is about it. You really go on the journey with him and you see all the experiences that he has. I will always love this movie and it will never get old to me.
506822,True,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Before I begin, I am never a fan of Hollyweird's portrayal of the south, but they do like their broad-brush perceptions of everyone  and I have come to expect it. The movie itself I thoroughly enjoyed, but there is another reason I have to elevate this movie to such a high pedestal. It wasn't the pace, even though the flow of the story was outstanding. There was never a dull moment. And the story itself was definitely a very good 'feel-good' nature...but that is not the reason for the highest of accolades. I walked into the theater skeptical and exited, hoping there would be more. The acting was spot-on. Again...this is not the reason for my highest of marks. From the smallest part to the star, they were all enjoyable. I am not always a Sally Field fan, but as Mother-Gump, I really liked her. She knew quite well what she had to work with and she did her best to give her flawed her son a road map through life. Forrest Gump, being the loving son, never veered from the plan. Stumbling along that path, Gump couldn't help but fall into countless, seemingly inescapable misfortunes. Whether it was timing, serendipity or just plain luck, the Tom Hanks character's always rebounds with better than fortunate results. There are so many interesting twists and turns this flick takes, I cannot put my finger on one outstanding incident. Once again, this is not the reason for my love of the movie. But now comes the reason I enjoyed (or should that be appreciate) this movie so very much. Of all the interesting characters Mr. Hanks bumps into along his character's life-journey (real or fictional), the one I am most thankful for is LT. Dan. As outstanding Gary Sinise was in this roll, what Mr. Sinise did with his fame, is truly amazing. Look at what this actor has done since the movie. He is one person who has dedicated so much of his time to helping veterans and their families. He is an American Hero. He has selflessly helped so many of those who were wounded on real battlefields. Unlike many stars who will read a line or two for veteran-related commercials (which I am thankful for), this man is dedicated. He walks the walk and talks the talk. So for this reason I say this this movie is at the top of the heap. Convoluted reasoning, maybe, but it is my reasoning. I am just being truthful. An outstanding moviewith even better results."
506823,True,"This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen of all time! It's a classic and for good reason! It has terrific writing, astounding acting, incredible directing, great humor, powerful, genuine acting, a great script, great casting, and more!It's an example of a movie that you'll love for decades after you see it! The morals it has are great! It has a unique form of storytelling, relatable characters, powerful, emotional depth, a terrific message, and it's filled with the sheer beauty of the human heart!It's about a man, Forrest Gump, growing up with a mental disability among another problem I won't mention. He goes through life, facing his challenges, showing that he can accomplish so much even with the disabilities he has, but that's not even the best part of the movie!He eventually meets a good friend, someone he loves, and they both run away from their problems in life. However, once they face them, everything becomes crystal clear, and they find what they were looking for all along!This is one of those movies you have to watch at least at some point in your life, regardless of if you like live-action movies or not."
506824,True,"Stupid is as stupid does,"" says Forrest Gump (played by Tom Hanks in an Oscar-winning performance) as he discusses his relative level of intelligence with a stranger while waiting for a bus. Despite his sub- normal IQ, Gump leads a truly charmed life, with a ringside seat for many of the most memorable events of the second half of the 20th century. Entirely without trying, Forrest teaches Elvis Presley to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Yippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years. Meanwhile, as the remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest never forgets Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), the girl he loved as a boy, who makes her own journey through the turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s that is far more troubled than the path Forrest happens upon. Featured alongside Tom Hanks are Sally Field as Forrest's mother; Gary Sinise as his commanding officer in Vietnam; Mykelti Williamson as his ill-fated Army buddy who is familiar with every recipe that involves shrimp; and the special effects artists whose digital magic place Forrest modest a remarkable array of historical events and people."
506825,True,"This is one of the best life-story movies ever made, it's heart braking knowing that this man at the end knows his condition, one of the best scenes i think is the one when he meet his son for the first time, amazing. You have to relax to watch this movie, you need time to analyze the psychology of this guy. He's more or less like a baby in a man's body. One of the Funniest parts is when he starts to get famous and he meets the president and a lot of other famous people around the globe, or when i start his speech and there is a protester who unplug the audio cable leaving all listening to a silenced Forrest on the stage. An heartbreaking movie that explore love and friendship in a life time."
506826,True,"The first time I saw Forrest Gump was 2006,when I in high school,from then on,I think Forrest Gump is my favorite movie and the best one I have see.And in the past decade,I have seen the movie more than 30 times! every time the is new discovery,every time it can encourage me from low- spirited,every time it interesting,just like the first time I see it. besides,Tom Hanks's performance is perfect!Hanks is a great actor,I saw almost all his movies,but the beginning is Forrest Gump,thanks for his performance,Forrest is not just a film image,but a symbol of self- improvement which encouraging thousands and ten thousands of people like me who need spiritual backing to find themselves.So I see Forrest Gump again and again,Forrest is my brother! (sorry for my English is not good enough to express my opinion,they forbid using Chinese,so I hope your can understand what I want to say.)"
506827,True,"This Is Such a GOOD FILM says Me!!! Good cast, lovely story and I can't believe it won 6 academy awards, what a blockbuster. With... Tom Hanks, Gary Sinse and Sally Field Check out my profile Check out my lists More reviews possibly coming soon I Love IMDb. Fine I'll tell you the proper film, it's about a guy named Forrest Gump who has this incredible life and won an academy award for BEST PICTURE. I recommend you tell your children under 12 that this film is a 12+ with may contain some scenes from real life.The film was directed by Robert Zemeckis and had a budget over $55 million. Hope you like this review and wish you goodbye."
506828,True,"This film is beautiful from beginning to end. A masterful story that is entertaining, thoughtful, and brilliantly written, directed, and acted. The score is amazing as well.A trip through history through the eyes of Forrest Gump a boy who faces many challenges in life but perseveres through them all in his special way.Near the very end of the film be sure to listen closely as Forrest reveals his take on one of life's most important questions regarding predestination vs. free will.One of the very best movies of all time that can be watched over and over."
506829,True,"I think this is just one of the few few movies which I connected with so well...I don't know where to begin..Its been an incredible story and I bet there will not be a movie in future which will be as good..The Life of Forrest Gump...I must say,if this person existed really then he would have been the most historical person to ever live..And what an amazing,everlasting and natural performance from Tom Hanks...A well deserved Oscar for him.....I think life chose him to be a part of so many great and historical films..This movie is all about the historical life of innocent Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks) and his relation with Jenny Curran(Robin Wright)..He lived in Alabama and was 10 years old when braces were fit to his feet because of having crooked back..He was a child having a low IQ and every person thought of him as a lagging behind person..one day he was running away from his school mates who were bullying him and that day changed the course of his life...He ran for first time...he broke his braces and ran and ran....His inspiration at this time was his best friend Jenny Curran(Robin Wright) and later his crush..Forrest was very simple,innocent and straight forward kind of person..Still he witnessed some remarkable events in his life.The moments which were going to be written in history of USA..in high school he was there when two Negros were admitted in school full of whites for the first time.Elvis Presley visited his house..He won a medal of honor in Vietnam war..He served in army at different spheres..he was part of that football team which won the 1st prize and had a chance to meet with president...Forrest met US president 3 times in his life..and all of presidents were different on all 3 occasions..He set a record for running for 3 Years and got media attention and got famous all over America...John Lennon interviewed him on TV as well...He became filthy rich from shrimping business...This movie is full of life long lessons and some of the best lines of whole cinematic history...Forrest's mom always told him that life was like a chocolate box...you never know what you are going to have...In another scene it is quoted that destiny is what that happens to man...and in the end Forrest recollects both of these and says Life is blend of both of these...Whats most upsetting about this film is relation of Forest and Jenny....although Forrest did every one of the things above mentioned but one thing he wanted all his life was jenny...he never had enough of her.He never got that love and romance he deserved...She was his inspiration of every thing he had achieved. He was always thinking about her but she always avoided him knowing that he loved her...Finally they meet and marry when she is just about to die..and she dies weeks later..I personally wanted to see both of them together enjoying life and having good time..but that never happens..She loved her and one night when they met for a brief time they had sex which got her pregnant...she never told him and finally Forrest saw his son years later..when she finally wanted to be with him...That was one of the most emotional scenes of movie..when jenny told him that he was his dad...But that's what Life is all about.Sorrow,Grief,Happiness,Sacrifice,Innocence,Purity,Integrity, determination,strength of character,valor and above all Love...All these Precious life lessons in One movie..feels like dream...there's much to say...there are still many many important points i am leaving because review is stretching miles..the most important mentions are Sally field..Her role as Forrest's mother is depiction of serious determination and will....Gary Sinise as Lt Dan is best supporting role one can have...He wanted to die in battle field just as his ancestors had died in every American war but Forrest saved him..His character reflected valor,sacrifice and determination...Unlike his ancestors..he lived and became successful even after losing both of his legs. All 10 points from me...Watch it dozens of time..Its only going to turn out better.."
506830,True,"Forrest Gump, while not intelligent, has accidentally been present at many historic moments, but his true love, Jenny Curran, eludes him. Forrest Gump is a film that the first time i saw it i didn't like it that much but right now after seeing it again i absolutely loved but the film comes out with flaws not in acting or direction mostly it's the characters for example this is a 2 hours film and Jenny kinda pisses me off i get it she was abused as a child by her father it makes sense but what doesn't make sense is her spending time and traveling around with men who hit her and abuse her as well and when Forrest attacks 2 guys and goes nuts she acts normal we spend 142 minutes in this movie of seeing her playing a guitar naked, dating a bunch of a**holes and leaving Forrest every 2 or 3 years alone and when she returns she leaves again tell me where the message is on that? I don't hate Jenny she brought me the feels in the end with her story what i hate is the way the director uses her character and i hate that. Another problem i had was the way everyone treated Forrest calling him dumb and idiot like every 30 minutes this film as a whole is very hard to watch to be honest just for the way everyone doubted him even those girls when they called him stupid and Dan Taylor pushed her away and he fall over his wheelchair and those chicks made fun of him it was painful. But besides that this film is truly a cinematic treasure with Tom Hanks giving one of the finest performances of his entire life and also inspiring people and even meeting famous presidents or singers like Elvis and John Lennon (they did a pretty good job with those scenes by the way) or even the promise he gave to his dear friend Bubba Blue and it's so sad seeing a very young Haley Joel Osment as Forrest Junior he was very talented but once again Hollywood ruined another young kid. As for my favorite moment in the entire film it has to be when Forrest find out about his son and the first thing he asks is if he is smart that scene destroyed me completely. Forrest Gump deserves all the praise it gets but like i said characters like Jenny should and could be handled much much better."
506831,True,"Title: Forrest Gump Duration: 2h 22min Year: 6 July 1994 Important people: o Director: Robert Zemeckis o Writers: Wiston Groom and Eric Roth o Stars: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright and Gary Sinise Genre: Drama, Romance Synopsis: Forrest Gump is not intelligent, he has accidentally been present at many historic moments and Jenny Curran, his true love, eludes him. My opinion: I don't like dramas or romances, but this film is very different. It is fun like a comedy and it is very original. This film changes the typical idea of a ""perfect guy"" and it changes this typical guy for a strange and a silly man who is so lucky. This is the first reason why I love this film, the originality. The second reason is the production and the direction; the actors are fantastic, I especially loved Tom Hanks' Forrest Gump (whose acting was incredible). And the last reason is that it has got very good visual effects that it make an interesting and spectacular film. And it isn't only my opinion, it was nominated for thirteen Academy Awards, and it won six of them. This film won't be forgotten for a long time. Rating: 9/10"
506832,True,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The movie Forrest Gump talks about cycles in life. Sometimes we are up, sometimes we are down, but we have to keep on going. And always, always trust in God. The great performances by Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise,Robin Wright and Sally Fields threw me to an extraordinary experience on how do I want my life to be. It is wonderful how this movie represents life in such a pure and realistic way. The world is in our hands to get the must of it. We need to follow the way as our heart tell us to do so. I love up so much some facts about history such as the Kennedy's, Elvis Presley, Alabama College Football Team, Vietnam War. If anyone have not seen Forrest Gump please watch it, it is a great trip."
506833,True,"Based on the 1986 novel by Winston Groom of the same name; Forrest Gump is about a simple man, named Forrest (Tom Hanks) whom with a low I.Q. who goes through life, accidentally being present at many historic moments, while building success for himself, however, never getting with his true love, Jenny Curran (Robin Wright) which mostly seems to be the only thing, that is eluding him. Without spoiling the movie, too much, this feel-good, financial blockbuster was indeed one of my favorite movies from the 1990s. I still quote, act out, & rewatch this movie, even with the downer tragic ending, this film has. I just can't help, loving it, despite the film changing a lot from the source material, like Gump's core personality and size. I kinda like that, he's not an autistic savant. In my opinion, it would be, too jarring. It would be, really too odd and unrealistic to see him, play chess, while being an astronaut, while people still thinking that he's an idiot. I kinda like that the film primarily focuses on the first eleven chapters of the novel, before skipping ahead to the end of the book. The middle part of the book is truly outrageous with Gump fighting off, cannibals, and becoming a pro-wrestler. That was way too out there to be taken seriously! The careers, he got in the film, seems more grounded with the reality of his character and the story. In addition to skipping some parts of the novel, the film adds several aspects to Gump's life that do not occur in the novel, such as his needing leg braces as a child and his run across the United States. Those changes really did help the film, a lot. This movie was also well shot by Robert Zemeckis. It made great use of its locations. I also love the use of CGI techniques to make it look like Tom Hanks was in some of the archive footage with various historical figures. Most of the visual effects in this film were pretty impressing at the time. Yet, I just wish the voice-dubbing was a little better. It doesn't really match well, with the movement of the long-dead historical figure's lips! While, the movie does have a lot of profanity, sex/nudity, drug use and violence for a PG-13. I think it somewhat works with the rebellions style of the 1960s. I also dig the film soundtrack. Great use of many well-known artists of the 1950s & 1960s. It's really does fit with that era of time. Also, the original music that Alan Silvestri made for the film was also beautiful. It fits some well in the film. Not only did that work, but the acting was outstanding. Tom Hanks was amazing as the title character. In other hands, this dim-witted, guileless, Southern-drawling simpleton hero could had turn into a bumbling yet annoying unlikeable offensive mental retarded stereotype. Instead, Hanks makes the fictional character, Gump seem like a real person with real motives and feelings. He really did deserve the Oscar, despite what some critics make say about his performance. Even the supporting cast was well-done. I love all of the characters ranging from 'Bubba' Blue (Mykelti Williamson) to Mrs. Gump (Sally Fields). I even kinda like Jenny, even when the writers made her, somewhat a horrible selfish trouble-person, who leaves Gump with a kid that grew up to be Haley Joan Osment in one of his first movie roles. Then- who can ever forget, Lt. Dan Taylor? This was Gary Sinise finest role. The character development that they gave him, was heart-breaking, yet hopeful. I love his redemption story. The film has this 'ignorance is bliss' philosophy to it; that makes the movie, fun to watch. The satire on contemporary values, during America's mid-20th century accomplishments is truly funny. The historic 'zelig' style jokes are mostly a hit than a miss to the funny. I also like how ambiguous, Forrest's story, as some people believe that he might be an unreliable narrator who whitewashing American history. Yet, I don't think, it's as racist or sexist as some people think, it is. The film is a lot more positive than that. Forrest is a represented of what is innocence and good about the world. He has this, out right decency about himself. He helps his friends if they're in need, even if some of them, take advanced of his hospitality. Forrest Gump is also a surprisingly spiritual story, well-told. A lot of people has stated out, the relationship between Forrest and Jenny echoes the relationship of Hosea and Gomer in the Old Testament; which in return is about, the relationship between God and man. Hints, the white feather that floats through Forrest's life. The movie is about the question of whether we are masters of our own fate or on a path to a predetermined destiny. Another thing, interesting, is how some people has been noted to see some political interpretations which I kinda have to disagree with. While, it seem like Gump follows a very conservative lifestyle, Jenny's life is full of counter-cultural embrace, complete with drug usage, promiscuity, and antiwar rallies, and that their eventual marriage might be a kind of reconciliation between America's extremes political points; I agree with Hanks, the film was non-political and non-judgmental. Forrest Gump isn't about liberal or conservative values. It's about learning to live with your limitations, while also giving it, everything you got. About the film winning best picture in 1994 over films like 'The Shawshank Redemption' & 'Pulp Fiction', I think the movie deserve it. While, on the surface, those other two films look superior better and more mature. In true, 'Forrest Gump' has just as much to give as those films. Also, it's by far, the more entertaining film of the three. Overall: Forrest Gump is like a box of chocolates. It's super sweet."
506834,True,"One of the best Tom Hanks movies. The innocence of the main character makes amazing movie from the beginning, the way he transforms the lives of people is simply incredible. I loved it from the first time I saw him, the lessons it conveys are very important ... Never give up, especially the love and friendship. Life is really bumpy, with ups and downs, but we have to hold on to what makes us happy and never let go, otherwise we lose our identity. I loved it ... If you have not seen, do not know what you're waiting ... It will be one of the best films I have seen ... The setting, the actors, the script, are five star. The film teaches us very important life lessons and we must learn from them and do not let go next ... I will make you think about what have you done, but more importantly will help you make choices in the future. I just loved it, Tom Hanks is to be congratulated for fantastic character that is."
506835,True,"In recent years this movie has received a lot of backlash. Why? Because apparently it beat Pulp Fiction, and The Shawshank Redemption, at the Oscars or something. Well yes...it shouldn't have been chosen over those two, but does that make it a bad movie? Absolutely not! The premise of Forrest Gump, is the character Forrest Gump. He is rather simple minded, but has many hidden talents, and has accidentally been at many significant events in history.And when I say history what I really mean is American history. This movie is also largely about America, and American culture. This is by no means a bad thing, it's very interesting, and it's part of what drives the plot forward. At times the movie can be very patriotic, and this could be what put some viewers off. I'm not from America, and while it didn't put me off, a lot of the people I was watching it with, were so, and for that reason.I personally think it's part of the story and simply take it for what it is. The biggest flaw of the movie is Forrest's love interest Jenny. I'm not saying that she wasn't well acted (the actress playing her did a great job) but her character is the problem. This movie is ultimately a love story, and on one side you have the lovable Forrest, whose character you come to love, and then there's Jenny. Is there anything particularly lovable about Jenny (after she grows up that is?) Not necessarily. She could be seen as a bad influence, considering some of the things she does.Fortunately that is not in the movie all that much, but it does detract, when you really think about it. Despite this problem this is an enjoyable film, one definitely worth watching, and one you'll probably find yourself quoting afterwards...a LOT. With all that in mind I give this movie a 7/10"
506836,True,"I can't believe how long it has taken me to watch Forrest Gump but I am so glad I did. I won't cover the story or write too much as it has all already been said, i just wanted to add my piece. The story was heartwarming, heartbreaking, inspiring and emotive. I was not bored for one second of this film. The actors are all brilliant and engage you right from the start. The story is told in flashback style which is incredibly well suited to the story. This is a classic for a reason, watch it, most people will love Forrest Gump. The only negative about the whole film is how sad the story is, whilst it is careful to never linger on a depressing note, this film may as well be called Here is likable Forrest Gump, now watch as everyone he loves dies."
506837,True,"This movie is great but there are some unrealistic things,Thats why i gave just 9 out of 10. For example, jenny were always accidental at Forrest. When Forrest were at the military jenny where there. And unrealistic is he became star from everything what he did. And he ran round of the world. I know the movie wanted to show his perseverance but i don't like unrealistic things in movie. (Also i don't like unrealistic things if its Symbolize something.)Forrest was my exemplar. Everyone mocked him because he is handicapped but Forrest didn't interested about it. What Forrest did insistently he became the best from it. eg.Table Tennis,Football and Crab Fishing. The movie showed that he first couldn't play Table Tennis but he didn't care anyone he didn't care anything, he's just knock knock and knock the ball. If he don't have table tennis partner he's playing with his self. That was my favorite scene. I feeled remorse in myself and i decided i will never mock anybody because of his body or for anything. (That was the first thing what inspired me.)The second was the perseverance, he never stopped playing table tennis and he became a star. Every day every night he's just played this sport and he wasn't different as anybody, just in one thing.. The perseverance. Oh, and the movie showed me one more thing. Forrest didn't have the best life but he brought out the best. He never were sad he always thought:It could be worse.Good movie i think YOU HAVE TO YOU MUST watch this movie!"
506838,True,"A movie marvel, Forrest Gump is a must see, and I mean it. Any movie goer who hasn't seen this movie should have it on his list.Forrest Gump is a touching story which puts you in the perspective of a man with an deficit of some sort, without degrading him... Forrest is like a child in an adult's mind and an adult world. But even someone like forest can and will do great things. With Forest, you will see major events that shaped the 70s, including the Vietnam War, the hippies, Watergate, the assassination of Kennedy... all through his perspective.Forest is good of nature and will always do what he thinks is best, he has a naive view of the world, which he sees as something beautiful, he is selfless and will always give when he can. Great acting, directing and story telling, the movie will make you believe it is real and want it to be real.I have seen this movie many times before and I will see it again."
506839,True,"This movie is amazing! It has great actors like Robin Wright and Tom Hanks. The story line is so sweet with beautiful music in the background. A must see movie! I'd recommend ages 13+. It tells the story of Forrest sitting at a bus stop telling anyone who come's to sit with him part of his life story. His gait problems, first love, best friend, the war, making money, losing love and finding it again and having a restaurant. Forrest makes people laugh, he makes me people cry, he has wisdom for everyone including the famous quote:""life is like a box of chocolates, you never know which one you'll get""."
506840,True,"Forrest Gump is an amazing movie. Tom Hanks gives what is arguably his best and most iconic performance in a movie that never ceases to surprise me.There are a million things that could have gone wrong with this movie, such as Forrest Gump becoming an annoying character or thinking wrong of Jenny for constantly denying Forrest, but thanks to the performances, writing and directing by Robert Zemeckis, this never happens. Actually, it's quite the opposite! You grow to love Forrest Gump and you can totally understand where Jenny is coming from considering what she's been through and the time period they live in. This movie show us the time period it takes place in so well and it ties in the events that happened during that time incredibly well. Many people don't get the message of the movie. It's not just some dumb guy taking part in random events throughout history because of luck. No. Absolutely not. Forrest Gump tells an inspiring story about a man, seen inferior by others because he's not intelligent, who accomplishes some of the most incredible things some of us could only dream of doing. Why did he do them? Because he felt like it. The message of this movie is, anyone can do anything, no matter where they stand in society or where they come from. If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish it.There aren't many, or any bad things I can say about this movie, so I'll just say this. Forrest Gump is an incredible movie, it's one of my favorite films of all time."
506841,True,"Forrest Gump (1994): Dir: Robert Zemeckis / Cast: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Sally Field, Mykelti Williamson: Brilliant filmmaking that stretches many historical aspects all observed and experienced by one simple individual who lived a complicated life. Forrest Gump was born and raised in Alabama where he overcomes a walking disability, survives Vietnam, starts a shrimp business, plays football, and meets two Presidents. What is most interesting is its emphasis upon the historical elements through the limited understanding of Gump. Excellent work by director Robert Zemeckis whose impressive resume also includes such unique films as Back to the Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Remarkable work by Tom Hanks as Gump whose accomplishments never out weight his sense of devotion. Robin Wright plays Jenny who descends into drugs all the while denying the one man who has always sheltered her. Mykelti Williamson plays Vietnan buddy Bubba whose friendship with Gump would live on when a dream becomes a reality. Gary Sinise is commanding as Lieutenant Dan Taylor whose sense of duty is tested when Gump saves him thus opening other opportunities. Sally Field plays Gump's caring mother whose advice is carried on through memory. Sometimes unfairly depressing but demonstrates one's purpose to do great things. Score: 9 / 10"
506842,True,"Forrest Gump is a really good movie. I've been to the restaurant in Galveston where the had t-shirts and all kinds of souvenirs for the movie. It was sad to me how Bubba died and I loved the ending of the movie when Forrest meet his son. Forrest acts a little slow in the movie but he is smart. Forrest is very determined to run he ran a long long long way. People actually started running with him. He always go by what his mother told him ""life is like a box of chocolates you never know which one your going to get"" Forrest's mother never criticized his mind when people called him stupid she would say ""Stupid is as stupid does"""
506843,True,"This film is a must-see for anyone and everyone. It teaches viewers many life lessons and shows the aspects of life through a different lens. Many walk away from this film wanting to embrace the little things in life. There is not much to dislike about Forest Gump as a character. He has such a big heart and because he is slow-witted, he has a very simplistic yet fulfilling lifestyle. Gump always follows his heart and does what he believes to be right, regardless of others judgment. An example of this is all the times he ""saved"" his best friend Jenny. There were a few times in the film that Forest didn't appreciate how a man was speaking to or touching Jenny, and every time Forest would immediately pry them off of her, despite her requests. This film also had comedy, drama, action, and emotion, perfectly blended together to create a great all-American film."
506844,True,"This movie, widely renowned as one of the greatest of all time will forever be a great watch as well as always being relevant to our society today. It's off-hand mentions of social issues of the sixties and racial undertones mixed with the comedic pleasure of Tom Hanks captivates us throughout the movie making it pleasurable to watch over and over again. Over the course of the movie I felt myself drawn to Forrest's quest to get the love of his life Jenny. Though many times it seems as though they may be together, some force separates them until the end where she ultimately dies. My favorite character is the film is Bubba, Forrest's friend which he meets in Vietnam but is killed in battle, Forrest ends up taking over Bubba's shrimping company which turns wildly successful. This relationship is a perfect example of Forrest's unconditional love and friendship for multiple characters throughout the movie causing many tear jerking scenes."
506845,True,"It's truly a great movie,maybe one of the best I've ever seen,so I voted 10.And it worth it.If I'd watched it like 10 years ago,I certainly won't appraise it this much.But when I grows older,it all seems so...delicate,you might say,and,it's almost unfold the whole life of Mr. Forrest Gump in front of you.You can see Gump at many historic moments,and you might think he's a legend,and all the sudden,things went sideway,the tense atmosphere almost sucks all the air out.Then,there would be a natural turn take place,and the story moves to next chapter.The director surely knows his work. Then again,in this movie,if I rate the story and the screenplay at 9,the cinematography would be at 8,and the BMG would be at 10.Yes,I think the background music is the best part of this movie.It fits right in,but take it out,it's still brilliant.You can easily feel the story behind it.Especially the famous part ""Forrest Gump Suite"",it's born for this movie(despite the fact that it is born for this movie). Oh,holy god,I think I got too excited and now I don't know what I was writing about.I'd better stop."
506846,True,"I mean-yeah, I will not tell that I watched a film- I would rather say I felt it. Though that 'Statue of Liberty' or 'President Carter' plot holes are quite 'eyebrow shriving'- some, or little boy like me doesn't sit or lie to watch a film for finding mistakes. He wants the full josh, the full energy, enthusiasm whatever you say. The film just poured me with full satisfaction of watching a film.Humour, sadness, action, drama and a Vietnam film all rolled into one.I'm not a stone cold, heartless villain, but it takes a lot to make me cry when I watch a movie. Bambi's mother, I couldn't care less. Jimmy Stewart in, ""Oh, what a wonderful life,"" - yeah right! The Lion King, when Mufasa bites the big one - on the verge.But seriously - I bawled my big brown eyes out, on several occasions in this film. A real tear-jerker, and a wonderful character, played to perfection by Tom Hanks. Every bit as worthy for the Oscar as Rooney was to win the Premiership in 2007.I cannot say it enough: This is THE film of all time. Watch it, and you'll see.In one word- Loved it much!!!!!! (Sorry I spoke 3.)"
506847,True,"Quite simply, the greatest film ever made. I am a big fan of Tom Hanks and I have enjoyed pretty much all of his movies over the years but it was a close call between this and the green mile but I think forest gump is my favorite Hanks film of all time.It's such a nice story that is told in a clever way making you feel like a child once again, the main character played by Hanks is lovable, you can't help but hope for the best for him and simply just want to reach out and tell him everything will be OK. The movie has a realistic feel even thought it's fictional but this is because of how it goes though real time events, the main reasons why I love this movie so much is because it's like reading a book the story line takes you to another time and other place and the only bad thing is when it ends and you bounce back to reality."
506848,True,"In my opinion, this is one of the best movies ever made. The way Forrest go through his life and how spontaneously he solves his problems is something that everybody has to see. Contrary to his best friend and wife Jenny Curran, there's actually no problems for him, everything is gonna be how it is gonna be.As his mother always says: ""Life is like a box of chocolate, you never know what you gonna get"", he follows that sentence and succeeds to become the best of the best, a person who everyone else wants to be. On the other hand his undervalued, but very clear and positive mind tends to get something else, a peaceful and happy life with his future wife Jenny.It seemed impossible but again as his mother said, ""Stupid is as stupid does"", he was a successful at everything he was trying to do because of his unstoppable persistence. He didn't think if he could or couldn't do that, he just did that. Because of that, this is one of the most inspiring movies ever filmed and has absolutely deserved my 10 stars rating."
506849,True,"This movie has it all. The actors and actresses were terrific led by strong performances by Tom Hanks, Gary SInese and Robin Wright. The most admirable character in the film is the protagonist Forrest. HIs unconditional love for Jenny, who continuously lets him down, is encouraging to see. Forrest is not a smart man but he manages to do so many great things with his life, from winning the medal of honor to being a successful shrimp boat captain. Forrest teaches us to think less and to stop worrying about every detail, to just go with the flow and good things may happen. Although Forrest has many good moments in his life he also faces great adversity. He loses his friend Bubba, his Mother and Jenny continuously deserts him. When Forrest hits his breaking point he just runs away from it all and goes on a cross country journey. Throughout his run he learns that you can'y move forward until you forget about the past and move on. Overall this is an extremely entertaining film that all should see"
506850,True,I thought that the movie Forest Gump was a very good movie that helped show what the times were like in the 50s and 60s. It was a very interesting movie let you see all the important events that took time in this place. It was also cool how they used Forest Gump and showed his views on it and how he was able to overcome a lot of the difficult tasks such as when he went to Vietnam. My favorite scenes were when he played the ping pong game and also when he went to war in Vietnam. That part was very good because it showed what it was like during that time. The movie was also very good because it provided a moral lesson and showed the struggles Forest Gump had to overcome and it thought you to be kind to people and accept them for who they are. Overall this movie was very good and it provided looks of historical details
506851,True,"This review like many of mine will be a ponderous piece without any structure or train of thought.The feather falls. This is a beautiful tale of the life of a simple boy in a complex world. This story captures everything that there is to love about the world when stripped down to its most basic form. The social commentary on the complex social structures that have developed over the millenia, how would they seem to someone who was born for another time. From why we run, fight, play sports like ping-pong, rebel for the sake of rebellion, and even do the same things again and again have been explored in this movie. In this age of stress, over-thinking and complications, one big thought was how being a simple boy with an IQ of 75 was the greatest strength Forrest had and his clarity of mind was never a roadblock in what he felt like doing. It goes to show how far the upbringing of someone would shape their values and leave you craving their simplicity for yourself.Not being an American most of the funny stuff had somewhat little sense to me, however I have enough of a context to be able to appreciate the big historical events events that kept popping up in the movie and boy were they put in seamlessly in the narration.Finally what can I say about Tom Hanks but that I can't imagine anyone other than him bringing out the emotions of someone like Forrest Gump, it is a biased view because I do not know anyone like Forrest Gump but I would like to think that Mr. Gump is what they would be like. That's all I have to say about this. Feather floats again."
506852,True,"Forrest Gump, directed by Robert Zemeckis, is an inspirational movie that can be for any audience. The following actors: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, and Sally Field are all excellent actors who form this movie into the classic that it deserves to be. Forrest Gump, acted by Tom Hanks, is a character that has a journey of a life time. Living through many events, like the war in Vietnam, his character changes, however is love for Jenny will never change. He, Forrest Gump, is an inspirational man. How he cares for everyone he meets/ lives with: his mother, Jenny, Bubba,and Lieutenant Dan is something every man should do. Watching this movie for the first time was heartwarming.The scene that is most memorable for me is when Forrest Gump is acting as a hero within the war as a soldier. Following his lover's advice of ""To run Forrest run"" he took to action accordingly. However, he couldn't leave his best friend, Bubba behind. Searching for Bubba, he saves many other men along the way, including Lieutenant Dan. He receives the congressional medal of honor for his service. However, he didn't see the ""reward"" as the most important thing in his life, but rather Jenny is. That is why Forrest Gump gave her his medal of honor.This movie is highly recommended to all people around the globe. I give this a 10 out of 10 for great acting, create directing, and a great, inspirational story."
506853,True,"awesome movie, awesome story. i was very impressed. i would like to watch it again today. I can't think of anyone else as Gump, after seeing how Hanks makes him into a person so dignified. so straight-ahead. The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness. in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths. I've never met anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before, and for that matter I've never seen a movie quite like ""Forrest Gump."" Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream."
506854,True,"This film is easily one of the best films ever made. Robert Zemeckis and Eric Roth are geniuses with what they have come up with, with this film. The storyline of a young simple lad growing up listening to every word his ""Mama"" says and trying to make friends as any other child would, but he was different because of his back was bent so he had to wear braces on his legs. But there was one little girl that was friendly to him 'Jenny' she would stick up for him. Which turns into a life-long friendship. And as you find out as the story goes on it shows that even people with a low IQ can do very well in life. This film also has a very important and very true phrase at the end ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get"" this is a lovely film for anyone really. You will be crying at some points, smiling at some points and some points you will be shouting at the screen. In all it is as My summary says 'The best film ever made!'."
506855,True,"Forrest Gump is a film that portrays the life of Forrest Gump through flashbacks and voice over narration. We meet Forrest Gump, a slow man perfectly portrayed by Tom Hanks, at the beginning of the film when he introduces himself to the first person who sits next to him on a bench at a bus stop. It is from this point that we begin the journey of his life starting with his ""philosophical"" mother Mrs. Gump played by Sally Fields and his unfortunate need for leg braces. From here Forrest takes the bus to school for the first time and we are introduced to his childhood friend and love at first sight, Jenny Curran played by Robin Wright. In college, Jenny and Forrest go their separate ways. Throughout Forrest Gump's life he experiences and causes many historical moments such as inspiring Elvis Presley's dance moves, meeting multiple presidents, and uncovering the Watergate Scandal. Although, these are monumental experiences, it seems he is somehow always drawn back to Jenny. In the film, they are brought back together several times. A significant time being when Forrest loses his mother and Jenny stays with him. The morning after their night together, she once again leaves him. In the end, we are brought back to Forrest Gump, the narrator, in present day looking for Jenny in response to a letter she sent him. The result of their one night together, left them with a son, Forrest played by Haley Joel Osment. Jenny and Forrest Gump are finally united and get married before she dies of an unknown virus. The film ends perfectly on a scene much like the one where Forrest first met Jenny, but with Little Forrest getting on the bus for school for his very first time.The theme of this film seems to be torn between drama and comedy. However, the main focus is the endurance and true love that Forrest has for Jenny. Although, he is always there for her when she needs him, she always ends up leaving him and going her own way. This fact does not seem to deter his love for her and every time she comes back into his life, he embraces it.A scene that reinforces this unbreakable love that Forrest has for Jenny is when they are reunited again in Washington. They are having a conversation before Jenny leaves him once again, which she has done multiple times before this scene. Even though she is preparing to leave him again, Forrest gives her his medal of honor and tells her that the reason he is good to her is because she is his girl. And then she was gone from his life again.Another film that is quite a different story but relates to the endurance of true love is The Notebook. In this film a young man tries his hardest to be with a young woman, before they are separated. Years later they are brought back together, but she is with another man. When they finally end up with one another she ends up with Alzheimer's. He spends the remaining days of their lives together reading to her and trying to bring her back to him.Music has a way of affecting our emotional response to a film. In Forrest Gump the use of music is very effective especially when changing scenes. When Jenny hitches a ride with a stranger instead of staying with Forrest, the musical score is soft and almost sad. However, the musical score playing when they see each other again in Washington is blissful and romantic. Another technique used in this film is voice-over narration. This narration done by Forrest emphasizes his thoughts and feelings of Jenny even though she is absent from a majority of the film. The use of this narration conveys his slow point of view on his life and the things that happened in it, but also speeds the passage of time along. The film itself is already a little longer than necessary, so voice-over used for narration is important in moving the film along at a good pace but creating an impact on his way of thinking.Overall, this film holds your interest in its creativity and alterations of historical events. The intermittent connection of Forrest and Jenny's lives surpasses decades. In the end, even though Jenny has an unknown virus, Forrest marries her and takes care of her until death do they part. This ultimately paints the picture of the true love that Forrest had for Jenny and how it endured the test of time."
506856,True,"Forrest Gump is quite a unique character in a movie not to mention real life. Trying to explain what Forrest Gump is a movie would be a challenge. The movie seems like a mix of different genres, there is comedy, drama, action, and its also a story about coming to age. The many different genres of this film are probably a main reason while this film is number 13 on IMDb top 250 movies of all time. It caters to so many different audiences, that anybody can find someway to relate to this film and it's message. The screenplay which was wrote by Eric Roth has the depth of modern movies and its protagonist, played by Tom Hanks, is a very honest and wholesome man who happens to have a low IQ of 75, this film shows him growing up between the 1950s and the 1980s and ends up becoming a part of every major thing that happened during that time in American history. He overcomes all of this turmoil with nothing but honesty and sayings that his mom always told him.The film is more of a look back at American history, through the narration and eyes of a mentally handicapped man.Tom Hanks is probably the only actor that could have pulled this off, he is amazing actor which has been a variety of films he isn't one of those actors that is only really good at playing certain parts. The theme of Forrest Gump is to teach a lesson about overcoming adversity no matter what challenges that you face, you never know the amazing places that your life will take you. We see that this film centers on man who isn't the brightest bulb in the closet. But he has many other amazing qualities that allow him many opportunities in his life. For instance, there is a part in the film the doctors thought Forrest was never going to walk without the help of special braces. He defies the odds by simplifying trying to run away from some bullies, and finds out that his legs are just fine. They make Forrest's legs are a big part of this film because of his incredible speed and endurance this allows him to go to college and played for the Alabama Crimson Tide. He even said the military was easy all you had to do was listen to what you are told and say yes sir. It is not that easy for most people, trust me I did 8 year in the Army. The whole film is about overcoming adversity, another example of the theme, when Forrest becomes a world class ping-pong champion He proves that you don't need to be very smart to be successful life, all you need is a little can do attitude and some elbow grease. He did all this and the only person that believed in him was his mother played by Sally Fields and Jenny played by Robin Wright. Robert Zemeckis, the director, did a great job making Forrest do his own narration, you felt that you were in the head of Forrest the whole time going on the journey of his life with him. This was a much better way of delivering the story then hearing it from a third party narrator. He also does some brilliant camera angles that show Forrest's emotions during much of the film, you can see Gump's emotions as he lives this events over again in his life, which helps you feel more connected to the protagonist. In conclusion, Forrest Gump is a great film when you need a reminder that anything is possible and can be overcome with just a different outlook and some hard work. It doesn't matter what type of genre is your favorite this movie will instantly become on of your favorite classics that you will never get tired of no matter how many times that you watch it. This movie is an easy 5 stars for me, it has so many simple yet complex elements in the story and the character development. You will surely not be disappointed."
506857,True,"Friday is the last day for The Story on WUNC. The program's host, Dick Gordon, is leaving the station after eight years with the nationally distributed show. He spoke with WUNC/North Carolina Public Radio's Eric Hodge Friday morning.ERIC HODGE: Good morning Dick.DICK GORDON: Hi, Eric.HODGE: So, why the move, Mr. Gordon?GORDON: Well, it's never one thing. It's always a bunch of different things, but what led the way for me is the fact that my mother is getting on in years, we are feeling a long way away from our daughters, who both make their home in Canada, and it just seemed like a good time to make a decision to make that kind of switch. I mean, you never want to walk away from something that is as much fun as The Story just for a frivolous reason, but change is not a bad thing for me and we'll see where it leads us.HODGE: What do you think you've achieved over these eight years?GORDON: Wow, that's hard to judge at this point, because I'm still kind of right in the middle of one foot out the door and one foot in the door, but when I look over my shoulder, I'm actually really proud of the body of work that my producers and this station put together by finding a way of giving dignity, intelligence, and some kind of emphasis to the stories of ordinary people instead of, I think, doing what we do too often in radio, and that is simply turning our microphones toward the important people - because we think they're important - or the people who have a quick opinion to offer. We kind of shut out the stories that matter most about what's going on on our street or in our town, in our state, in our country, and that was just a tremendous opportunity that we had to work at doing that. Sometimes we got it dead on. Sometimes we missed the mark, but because"

506859,True,"Forrest Gump is a 1994 classic film. The movie features Tom Hanks playing the main role of Forrest himself. The story is about a young boy who has been placed with braces on his legs and struggles with walking and running. Forrest is often picked on for his disability. Forrest makes friends with a girl named Jenny on the bus. Forrest is then chased by a group of boys and must tries to flee from them, with encouragement from Jenny. While running away from the group of children Forrest's braces popped off of his legs. The film raised aids awareness. The film is also educational and is often played as an example in school History classes. The movie touched on Historical places and events. This movie shows that even the most disadvantaged can achieve greatness. The character of Forrest set a goal and achieved it. He also experienced hardships such as his mothers quite speedy death. This movie is very inspirational and I personally would recommend people to watch it."
506860,True,"This movie will please nearly any crowd. This is the one movie that I believe really has it all. Some films and series try to follow suit, but the one that does it best apart from Gump is the Pirates of the Caribbean series, which is primarily an action series anyways. The different events of the back half of the 20th century hit many different areas of life and many different genres of film. There is plenty of humor, bits of excitement, romance placed throughout, moments of sadness and inspiration, and a pretty good amount of history. The fact that it is told out of the intellectually challenged Forrest Gump is nice. The audience still see the events from its own individual eyes, and some of those watching may have their own memories of the given points in history, but we also see the events in Forrest's simplified version. He's a great character because, while not very smart, he is an incredibly nice person that sees no reason to show malice towards anyone. So even with his impairment, he is really one step ahead of the world all of the time. Another great quality that he has is his influence. People now use his name to identify someone who has lots of important events happen around him, which is understandable. But he also happens to the events around him, if that makes sense. No historical event prompted him to do his three year run, develop his mad ping-pong skills, or be a great football player.The history involves more than just events, for we see the progression of culture and everyday life in the scattered glimpses we get of Jenny's life. She pretty much is a prime example of what not to do in the seventies, or really any stage of life. Her character is shown as free spirited, impulsive, whimsical, restless, and even stupid sometimes, but at the same time good-hearted deeper down. The other main characters are Mrs. Gump, Bubba, and Lieutenant Dan. Mrs. Gump is obviously the reason that Forrest is such a positively influential person. Bubba is very simpleminded life Forrest, but is a very good friend, as Forrest points out very blatantly. Lieutenant Dan is an exceedingly grumpy and pessimistic guy who lives off of his sorrows. In some ways, he's kind of what a mean Forrest would look like since they've both lost people and have some kind of impairment. What sets them apart is that they deal with their problems differently.It's clear that Forrest impacts all of the people listed above, but also the people he talks to at the bus stop and the other small people he meets along the way. Examples could include the bumper sticker and tee-shirt salesmen he meets on his run, the anti-war group, and his Alabama teammates.The technical execution is nothing special, but doesn't need to be either. If the whole movie took place in Vietnam, I would say that the war themed special effects should have been improved from their current state, but since there was only about five minutes of battle, the low-quality explosions were acceptable. The acting was spectacular from every character, big and small. This fact is perhaps what makes the movie as great as it is, because the characters are already well written so to pair it with great acting is like cinematic explosion.I would recommend this to just about anyone, but it's best to go into the movie with a pretty good knowledge of history from 1950 to 1980. It's a good go-to movie when a large group is deciding on a movie to watch together. So if you haven't seen it, strongly consider adding it to your shelf or online movie library. Overall Rating: 8.4/10."
506861,True,"this movie was one of the powerful movies i've ever seen. You feel such a connection to Forrest and u can hate the Jenny treats him at first. I balled out crying when jenny died but Forrest turns out to be a very good daddy to little ForrestWhen Forrest first goes off to war to Vietnam he finds his forever friend and i cried when Bubba died in his arms and his last words were ""Forrest, I wanna go home"" oh that got meBut this movie is also very funny at times, like when he says ""Lieutenant Dan I brought you some ice cream"" and then Lieutenant Dan throws the ice cream in his bed pan.I also love the scene in the beginning when Forrest breaks his braces and starts running and u just feel the courage that he had and it makes u feel all good inside and it's just such an inspiring movie"
506862,True,"So many famous Quotes came from that film: ""My momma always said, life is like a box of chocolate, you never know what you're going to get, Stupid is as a stupid does, Run, Forrest! Run!"" For a couple of examples.The film had so many historical actions like J.F. Kennedy's Murder, Vietnam War, Elvis. Just right amount of action not too much or too little of humor but just the right amount of humor. The plot was awesome, you newer knew what the movie had planned next (unless you have seen the film couple of times) for your entertainment. I absolutely loved this film tom hanks was perfect for the job."
506863,True,"20 years after ""Forrest Gump"" came out, I decided to rewatch this one and it was even better than what remembered from watching it the first time. The film won 6 Academy awards in 1995, including Best Picture, Best Director (Robert Zemeckis, ""Back to the Future""-trilogy, ""Cast Away"" again with Hanks later on) and Best Actor (2nd win in a row for Hanks after ""Philadelphia""). And even if it lost ""Best Score"" to ""The Lion King"", the music, especially the main theme, is nothing short of brilliant. It starts right away as we watch a feather fly towards the film's central character. Visually and acoustically a feast from minute one.Forrest sits on a bench waiting for the bus and tells the other people who are waiting his story. Thank God he did not know that he could just walk to Jenny, otherwise we may have never found out about his stories. And as diverse as Forrest's life is, as diverse are also the reactions from those people. Some sit quietly, others accuse him of being a liar and the old lady finally is captivated by his story. The interesting thing is that Gump gets out the photo as evidence not before the man (who accuses him of lying) leaves. He could have proved it easily, but he has nothing to prove to anybody. This is the frame of the story. The real action takes place in the stories Gump tells. Some true emotional highlights are included: Bubba's death and the funeral eulogy to Jenny (great HI. reference by the way) at the end. Of course, all the moments with his son (played by the very young Haley Joel Osment) are very much worth watching too. And then there is Gary Sinise who was pretty much on par with Hanks during their comedic and dramatic moments together. He did not won the Oscar, but was at least as deserving as Landau and Jackson. With his character, early on, you could never say if he would develop into a friend to Gump or stay/become a big antagonist. Finally, it turned out to be the former. When they have prostitutes one night at their place, it becomes truly clear for the very first time. Gump serves as a great role model to Sinise's character for all he achieved despite his limitations.This is not the greatest movie ever made, but there is a certain charm to it that makes it so unique in movie history, possibly because the central character is at least as unique. And finally, there is the Forrest-Jenny love story which is sweet from start to finish and one of the main reasons why this film will make you laugh, will make you cry and will make you feel for Forrest for its almost 2.5-hour . And even in the almost impossible case that you will not remain interested in Forrest's story, this film is very much worth watching alone for all the references to past decades (most of all in terms of the movements in society, the music and politics). ""Forrest Gump"" is a must-watch and that's all I have to say about that."
506864,True,"I really love this movie. It's so adorable and I love the little things they put into it. Like manipulating footage of presidents to put Forrest into them. Making him part of some of the biggest things in his lifetime. In this movie, we learn about a special man named Forrest Gump. We see his pretty much his entire life. He, as a middle aged man, tell random strangers whilst waiting for the bus. We see him meet his longtime friend, Jenny, when he was a young boy with leg braces. We see him grow up, sleep with Jenny, join the army, go to war in Vietnam, open a shrimping business, with his deceased friend in mind, him buy a share in Apple Computers, him play college football, him meet three presidents, him teach Elvis his iconic move, his mother dying, him run across America for no particular reason, him finding out he had a child with Jenny, him marrying Jenny, Jenny dying of aids, because she was a giant hippie then a giant druggie. And everything important or relevant in his life. Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10."
506865,True,"The story runs of a unit bases which the storyline that tells the story of Forrests life, the character, the story and the actor just makes this in my opinion best film ever as it based on a true story with a man who when to Vietnam to fight for his country, his-self and his pride. Forrest grows up to to realise that Jenny is sort of in a distant from him most the time as she begins to have a messed up like with the wrong people, Jenny gets that most into a addiction that only leaves her to that action with her life. Jenny to end with realises that Forrest is the right person for her and tells Forrest she sick and can die from it, she dies and Forrest to the best of his ability takes care of his son the new Forrest Gump the second"
506866,True,"Forrest Gump is a very inspirational film about a man, named Forrest Gump, who has a lower IQ than average, but has a very exciting and adventurous life because of all of the major historical events that he just so happens to run into. Forrest Gump stars Tom Hanks, as Forrest Gump, Robin Wright, as Jenny Curran, and Gary Sinise, as Lieutenant Dan Taylor. The acting in this film was of very high quality because the actors made it seem like the story actually happened. They also did a great job at making the characters seem more relatable to the viewer. Tom Hanks actually won an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Gary Sinise was nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for their performances in Forrest Gump. The director is Robert Zemeckis and the writers are Winston Groom, who wrote the novel, and Eric Roth, who wrote the screenplay. Forrest Gump is very well directed and written because of many aspects, including the visual effects and how most of the film is a narrated flashback. The visual effects in this film were outstanding. When Forrest was meeting all of the Presidents and when he was getting involved in the integration crisis at Alabama, it seemed like Forrest was actually there. This added on to the believability of the film. I also thought that it was very entertaining to be able to see the story from the view of Forrest Gump himself and wouldn't be nearly as fun if it weren't told like it was. One of my favorite characteristics of Forrest Gump is how entertaining and fun it is. The film never ceases to surprise the viewer. Forrest Gump is a fictional character that is getting involved with events that actually occurred in real life. Also, Forrest never really seems to realize the importance of all the events that he has accidentally influenced or walked into, which makes the film even more entertaining. There are also many serious attributes of Forrest Gump that make it a great film. Forrest seems to have a happy and successful life just from being innately good. This teaches a moral lesson to the viewer to show that good things happen to good people. A moral lesson is key to a film being considered good because it really gets the viewer invested in the story and makes the situations more relatable to their life. Forrest Gump is great because the film is encompassing the themes of entertainment and teaching a moral lesson. Also, Forrest Gump is a very memorable film, especially the quotes. Lines, such as ""run, Forrest, run!"", ""life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get"", and ""stupid is as stupid does"", are among the quotes that many people, including me, had heard before ever seeing Forrest Gump. Many people also know Forrest Gump because of its groundbreaking plot, which just so happens to be my favorite part of the film. In my opinion, the plot of Forrest Gump is the key reason why it is such a fantastic film. The plot is a mixture of multiple genres, such as drama, action, comedy, and even romance. When a film can cover all of these genres, it is bound to connect with many people in the audience. Forrest Gump can also be included in the Vietnam War movie category because Forrest is sent off to fight the war in Vietnam after he enlists in the U.S. Army. The setting of the film was an influential part of why the plot was so good because the story took place during a very interesting and exciting part of American history. Another one of my favorite aspects of Forrest Gump is the soundtrack because it contains many songs that were produced during the setting of the story. It includes some of my favorites, such as ""Fortunate Son"", by Creedence Clearwater Revival, ""California Dreamin'"", by The Mama & The Papas, and ""Mrs. Robinson"", by Simon & Garfunkel. The songs that were featured were very popular when they were released and continue to be popular in today's culture. The soundtrack simply adds on to the list of reasons why Forrest Gump is such a fantastic film. In my opinion, it is one of the greatest films of all-time and will continue to be for a very long time. I believe that it will definitely stand the test of time very easily and will be a classic in the future."
506867,True,"This movie introduces to some of the greatest moment of American history. I watched this movie when i was very young and some of the historic moment which have been visualized in this move where unknown to me but as time passed and i got chance to watch this again and again but it has been always a great movie for me.The most iconic dialogues which is also my favourite is ""when the Forrest Gump (played by Tom Hanks) says ""Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."" I hope to watch it with many times because it has been one of the iconic movies winning awards and acclaim."
506868,True,"A nice and inspirational movie. Loved this movie very much. I like the story very much its funny, and also touching. Forrest Gump, despite of his mental incapacity he meets popular person in the world, influence other people and helped them. He had a company and become rich.He is also part of some popular events. My favorite scene in the movie when he start running fast he breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Also the war in Vietnam where he met his friend Bubba who like to talk about shrimp.During the war he save Lieutenant Dan and become partner of his company and also heartbreaking when Bubba his friend died. While Forrest is in recovery for a bullet shot to his buttock he discovers his uncanny ability for ping-pong, eventually became popular and rising to celebrity status, later playing ping-pong versus Chinese teams.He endorses a company that makes ping-pong paddles, earning himself $25,000, which he uses to buy a shrimping boat, fulfilling his promise to Bubba. My favorite line in this movie is ""Life is like a box of chocolates...you never know what you're gonna get"". I'll never forget this film, its one of the best film of all times.It's incredible, a must see movie."
506869,True,"I was told that it was rubbish but when my sister received it from a friend for Christmas, we watched it and thought it was brilliant.It is funny,it has a lot of sadness and it is his life and shows all the things he does and grows up with.This is not a film I would usually watch but i enjoyed it and would recommend it still.I liked it because it was something new, it was something to relate to life, it was touching. I disliked some characters in it and other i loved but terrible things happened to them.The character i disliked the most was his best friend because of the way she reacted to him when he was sticking up for her."
506870,True,"This movie has got to be one of the best ever. I am not saying that because it is one of my favorites, but because there was a time when I had to watch this movie for the first time to see what it was like. It has a perfect balance of history, comedy, and romance. It is well executed and every key point is covered and not one detail left unturned. This is what real movies should be like. Personally, some of my favorite movies are ones such as Titanic, Cold Mountain, Armageddon, Pretty In Pink, etc etc. as you can tell I am one for romance movies. On a Top 15 list of my favorite movies Forrest Gump is #4. Even though I really love the romance between Forrest and Jenny, another thing that drew me to Forrest Gump is the history. It was amazing watching them fit Forrest into so many events. Fantastic cast, fantastic crew, and perfect execution of the book."
506871,True,"Forrest Gump is a 1994 movie directed by Robert Zemeckis starring Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump, a mentally handicap man who tells his life's tale to anyone who will listen while he awaits the reunion with his childhood sweetheart. Despite being told that he is different, Forrest's mother raises Forrest with love and advice, which leads to Forrest having crazy adventures as he ages and leaves his home. Throughout the film, Forrest is reunited briefly with Jenny as they both live out America's history in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Forrest Gump is a heartbreakingly honest and breathtakingly funny film capable of captivating audiences.The message behind Forrest Gump is simply that a true innocence of character will get he anywhere in life, even if he does not mean to go there. Forrest was always just in the right place at the right time, minding his own business. At one point, all Forrest is trying to do is go to class and he ends up on the news in a racial battle at his college. However, Forrest managed to stay innocent and kind in a crazy time, which shows that if even those that are said to be destined to be different are not always destined to fail. Jenny often talked about how destiny influenced everything, and she was right, only from most perspectives, despite his handicap, Forrest still had a better life than her.One of the best parts about Forrest Gump is Forrest himself. Forrest is not stupid; he is just a bit slow, but he is pure and honest to the core, which makes for both hilarity and heartbreak during such a turbulent time, with racial issues dividing the country, assassinations of people who prompted peace, and wars raging across the globe, not to mention all the other drugs, politics, and moral issues tearing America apart. Characters aside, my favorite part of Forrest Gump was the use of actual historical events that gave the film a more authentic and realistic feel."
506872,True,"Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson and Sally Field star in Robert Zemeckis' 1994 drama based on the novel. This story focuses on slow-witted, Alabama gardener, Forrest Gump (Hanks) who reflects his life experiences through friendships and historical moments. Wright (The Princess Bride) plays Forrest's friend & love-interest, Jenny Curran, Sinise (Ransom) plays Forrest's army lieutenant & friend, Dan Taylor, Williamson (Heat) plays Forrest's best friend, Bubba and Field plays Forrest's mother. This is a great film that's definitely one of Tom's best with a good cast & excellent score by Alan Silvestri. I recommend this."
506873,True,"In the movie Forrest Gump made in 1994, is about a man with a low IQ, who become a friend to Jenny as a child. His mom teaches him about life and to chose his own destiny in life. Tom Hank plays the role of Forrest Gump. Robin Wright is Jenny Curran, Gary Sinise plays Lt. Dan, Mykelti Williamson plays Bubba, and Sally Fields plays Forrest Gump's Momma Mrs. Gump. The movie opens with Gump sitting on a park bench and he picks up a feather. He will begin telling his story starting when he first met Jenny. Jenny has helped him when he was little by telling him to run from his bullies. Forrest were leg braces as a child, and when he ran one day, his braces broke off, and he never wore them again. Forrest began to fall in love with Jenny, but she had her own demons. Jenny would move away, and Forrest would begin his journey in life. First begin the Vietnam War. At the end of the war, he would once again be reunited with Jenny. And she would also once again leave him again as she does a couple of times. As he sits and talks to everyone that would sit on the park bench, he remembers everything that he has done in his life up to the time he is sitting there. His love for ""his Jenny"" is strong. He also makes some good friends along his way. The first being Lt. Dan from the army. And Bubba from the war. He would lose Bubba in the war, but Gump tried to save him. But as Gump moves forward, he would honor his friend Bubba when Gump gets some money. Lt Dan would help Gump in the shrimping business.Another major scene takes place when we find out why Gump is sitting on the park bench. He goes to see Jenny, and finds out that he is a father. Gump also learns that Jenny is sick. They end up being married, where Lt. Dan comes back to attend the wedding. Gump spends the rest of the days taking care of Jenny, and then taking care of his son, once Jenny passes away.Thinking of a movie that is similar to Forrest Gump would be the Notebook. In the Notebook, there is narration like Forrest Gump. There is a man in love with a women, and they go different ways, but do end up back together. Both movies are symbols of love. I'm a big fan of Forrest Gump. He goes beyond everything to find his love. Even though they weren't together, he still loved her, and only her. That love he has for Jenny, would bring them back together and they would have a son. Just like his mom told him to find his own destiny in life, he never stopped searching for ""his Jenny""."

It reminds me of my family and my friends. I love it. This movie should be one of the best movies of all time, time magazine rather. And also, I love the director of this movie, I love him always as he knew. Regardless to the Forest, this movie hasn't any connection to it.

506875,True,"Forrest Gump is one of my favourite movie in the whole entire world. Forrest Gump contains many different characters that teach you a message on the way you live in life. Forrest Gump is an inspirational movie that will teach you how to live. The main character is Tom Hanks and my favourite quote in the movie is ""Life is like a box of chocolate, you never know what your going to get."" Its a 2 hour movie but it is worth it. It is one of the best movie in the whole entire world through my opinion. It is a great film, that is set mostly in the olden times. It gives u what he has done since when he was born and is told on a bus stop to many people listening. There is many sad moments when his mum died. I give it a 10/10 because it is inspirational and a very funny and sad film."
506876,True,"Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump is an inspirational motion picture that all people in the world would continue to like for many years. The movie stars Tom Hanks in his 2nd Oscar winning portrayal as Gump a simple man with a low I.Q. but with good intentions. He is running his childhood with his best and only friend Jenny (played by young Hanna Hall). His mom (played by Sally Field) teaches him the ways of life and leaves him to choose his own destiny. Then he goes to college and makes the football team while in college, and then goes to the army for the Vietnam War finding new friends Lt. Dan Taylor (played by Gary Sinise) and Bubba (played by Mykleti Williamson). He wins medals and creates a shrimp fishing fleet, inspires people to jog, create a ping-pong craze, create the smiley, with bumper stickers and songs, donating to the people, and meeting the president several times. However it's all irrelevant to him when he can only think of his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran (played by Robin Wright). This was an inspiring masterpiece for the whole family to watch and also one of Tom Hanks' best performances of his entire career and Robert Zemeckis' boldest feature film he had ever made."
506877,True,"Tom Hanks, stars as the title character in the novel turned movie, Forrest Gump. The movie depicts Forrest's many adventures, as he narrates them to a string of strangers at a bus stop. ""Stupid is as stupid does,"" Forrest states to a stranger reluctantly listening to his story. Despite his low IQ, Forrest has inadvertently become a part of many of the history making moments in second half of the 20th century. The film follows Forrest as he teaches Elvis Presley to dance, becomes a college football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, punches a Black Panther, defeats the Chinese in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, builds a successful shrimping business, and becomes wealthy through an investment in a ""fruit company"" aka Apple Computers, and becomes an icon by running across the country for several years. Intertwined throughout his adventures is his undying love for Jenny, played by Robin Wright. Sally Field's stars as Forrest's mother, whose wisdom is extolled throughout the movie. Gary Sinise stars as Lieutenant Dan, Forrest's commanding officer in Vietnam and reluctant friend.Forrest Gump uses a series of flashbacks and voice over narrations to tell the story of a seemingly less than extraordinary man living an extraordinary life. This style of storytelling has been used, with mixed results, in movies for years, including the iconic Citizen Kane. The opening scene find Forrest sitting on a bench as a feather slowly drifts in the wind and lands at his feet, this sets the pace for the movie and subtly introduces one of the themes, is life a series of coincidences or are we the masters of our own destiny? Forrest tells one of his listeners, ""My momma always said, life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna to get."" His life certainly seems to reflect that sentiment. Through a series of well-timed coincidences Forrest influences some major historical events, including The Watergate Scandal, and falls into some incredibly fortuitous opportunities, like his college football career. Other events seem to be more of guided destiny, like his service in Vietnam, which led not only to meeting Lieutenant Dan, but also his ""best good friend"" Bubba. He subsequently goes on to save half the platoon, including Lieutenant Dan and brings Bubba's shrimping boat business to fruition and becomes very wealthy. The antithesis to these opportune events is Forrest's unrequited love for Jenny. Throughout all the stories Jenny pops in and out of Forrest's life, even when it seems that she is gone forever. He has loved her forever, but she keeps running from her past, in which Forrest is irrevocably entwined. Eventually destiny wins and Jenny, now terminally ill, returns a final time with their son, Forrest. The ending scene ties the theme back in, as the same feather falls from a book and is again carried away in the wind. The movie's portrayal of all these incredible events hinges on some incredible CGI and special effects, but not the fast-action, explosive effects we often see these days. Forrest's image is superimposed on historical news reels, at times with humorous results, like showing his unfortunately placed war wound to President Lyndon Johnson. One especially noteworthy example is the editing to reflect the loss of Lieutenant Dan's legs. In every post-Vietnam scene that includes Lieutenant Dan, his legs had to be digitally removed. The digital editing is so seamlessly done that some viewers thought that actor Gary Sinise had actually lost his legs. Forrest Gump successfully uses a mix of CGI enhanced flashbacks and voice-over narration to cause the viewer to reflect on destiny and the ripple effects we may have on the people with whom we interact. Are our lives just a series of coincidences or the destiny we chose?"
506878,True,"The year was 1994, an absolutely amazing year for film. Never since I was born, or to my recollection, since that year, has there been a better year for movies. Pictures like The Shawshank Redemption, Legends of the Fall, Pulp Fiction, even The Crow all came out that year. And then there was the year's crowning jewel - Forrest Gump. This is probably my favorite movie of all time. Anytime I feel down, or just tired of the world beating down on me, I can watch Forrest Gump and for a few hours, just forget everything. Twenty years later (and I can't believe it's been 20 years!) the movie still has the same effect on me. The story revolves around Forrest Gump, and man born with both physical and mental challenges, but with the wisdom and guidance from his mother, suggestion from his best friend Jenny (to just run if he was in trouble) and his kindness and good nature (and somewhat bumbling nature), he succeeds in life. Whether he's running from bullies, or bullets, or just life and heartache in general, Tom Hanks performance (coming off his first Oscar Win for ""Philadelphia"") was his absolute best. He rightfully won his second Best Actor Oscar for his performance here. The trials and tribulations Forrest overcomes, while humorously interjecting himself in some of the most memorable events in American History from the 60's and 70's makes the film that much more fun to watch. The supporting cast (Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Sally Fields) and really everyone in the movie does an exceptional job of bringing it all together. Forrest Gump is a feel good movie, and a true staple of the 1990's. The soundtrack is one of the very best ever compiled for a movie, and one of the few times I ran out and bough a movie soundtrack. I almost wish I could go back to 1994 and experience it again in a movie theater. But I'd want to do that for every major picture of 1994. If you've never experienced Gump - I highly recommend that you do! Even more-so if you're in need of cheering up."
506879,True,"Forest Gump is one of the greatest dramas of all time. Tom Hanks is easily one of the best actors of this age. This story is full of emotion and makes us realize that there are true heroes living among us. The soundtrack to the film is one of my favorites of all time because it fits to the time period of the film as well as to the emotion of each and every scene. As far as war films go, this is the best of all, although it does not focus on the actual wartime for more than a few minutes. Furthermore, I have never been a big fan of romantic films yet this one is a tear jerker through and through. It makes you understand just how loyal Forest is to Jenny, yet she doesn't give him all of her love until near the end. Then the hearts of every viewer are broken when she dies after such a short period of time together."
506880,True,"Tom Hanks plays the lovable caring character of Forrest Gump. Throughout the movie we see history through the eyes of Hanks' character. Forrest Gump lives a life full of heart ache and love. He falls in love with Jenny from an early age and spends he live showing her how he feels even though at times she does not return these feelings. It is not until the end of the film that they are able to come together and stay together, this time is but short when Jenny passes away. Forrest meets many interesting people along his journey who help shape him into the person he becomes. During his lifetime he achieves more that any one person could imagine, yet he is not phases by this, he is more focused what matters in like, which is love and friendship."
506881,True,"Brilliant. Is there any part Tom Hanks can not play? i mean c'mon this man is amazing, every role he plays in any film is just spot on, perfect, he is a true actor and many should learn from him. This is how to act!.The actor himself is amazing but the film a fantastic, it has everything a film should... love/romance, humour, gore/blood (not much though, heartfelt scenes, friendship and more. This film never gets old, over the years i have watched this film a number of times and i still love it.Great storyline, great scenes, great actors, what more could you want in a film. The film is rather long but it never gets boring, it keeps you hooked right until the end. Personally one of my favourite films of all time.Well worth a 10 / 10."
506882,False,I've got no words to say. this was the second movie of Tom Hanks I've see . i was totally amazed that how real this movie was. I've seen it more than 5 time. the ending was kinda painful but perfect.

506886,False,"This isn't just a movie that we see and enjoy, this is a my generation's motivator, when i was young (about the same age of little Forrest) life wasn't easy at school and in the street people were mean to me, because my parents had to move to this new place i had no friends back in the time, i was so skinny and small and had this crush on the most beautiful girl in my grad but the i was bullied so bad that i hadn't the courage to make friends no one was talking to me and my parents were always away because of their work and later when the used to see some marks of violence on my face they used to punish me and blaming me for being into a lot o fights i hadn't the courage enough to say that i am weak at school i played the role of this violent child to make my parents think that when i am alone i can be strong... but seeing this movie gave me an endless hope and it changed my life forever"
506887,False,This film is so awesome and funny its great for the whole family
506888,False,"Forrest Gump is very suitable for boys to see, very inspirational."
506889,False,"Very well put together story plot, tom hanks best performance ever! I watched forrest gump as a kid and even till this day I get teary eyed watching it. Forrest accomplished so much in this film which im sure motivated a lot of people to do the same by working hard to pursue their dreams. The funny thing about this story is up until lately I realized this film was filmed in savannah georgia down by river street."
506890,False,"""Forrest Gump"" is one of the greatest films ever made. It tells the story of the amazing Forrest Gump and all the traumatizing events he endures in a series of flashbacks as Forrest tells his life's story while waiting for a bus.Tom Hanks does a wonderful job playing Gump. I really enjoyed this movie and have watched it many times. There are parts that make you laugh, but there are just as many that make you cry. This film has all the emotions in it. The film has been very well worked out on all levels, and manages the difficult feat of being an intimate, even delicate tale played with an appealingly light touch against an epic backdrop."
506891,False,"You will never be boring watching this movie, full of surprises, good performances, good music, good history. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. This movie show that be different isn't a problem. Probably you will remember it forever. Not matter if you know about the American culture or not you will have fun watching it."
506892,False,"The most amazing movie so far, with the best interpretation from Tom Hanks!!! It is the best sample for those who say that, anything is possible when you believe. In addition to that, presents that people with special needs may luck in sight, but in real life they may be stronger, purer and more kind than anyone else!!! A must see Movie!!!"
506893,False,Forest Gump is a coming of age drama with comedic aspects that takes us through 3 decades of a simple minded man's life and through American history. From the racial strife of the equal rights movement. To the strain of the country during the Vietnam War. And also touching indirectly on the Cold War in the 80's. Forest Gump's struggle with his limited understanding takes him through a magical life. A wholesome family film for all ages.
506894,False,"I believe everyone has a right to their opinion about films or other topics. However, from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the filmmaker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels. From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation. Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend, he moves you with his character. Words don't grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys' tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright."
506895,False,"Director Robert Zemeckis (""Back to the Future"") gives the movie a bittersweet turn by concentrating on the main character's integrity. This is enhanced by his assorted friends who include the self-destructive Jenny; the hilariously boring soldier and shrimper Bubba (Mykelti Williamson, ""Free Willy""); and double amputee Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise, ""Of Mice and Men"").The show, enjoyable as it is for the most part, is far from original in concept. Peter Sellers played to the hilt his role of Chance, the simpleminded gardener who rose to fame in ""Being There.""While the Industrial Light & Magic clips of Forrest talking with presidents and other celebrities is indeed something to see, the same sort of documentary feel was featured several years ago in ""Zelig."" And Field's role as Forrest's strong mother is akin to Glenn Close's portrayal of the title character's only parent in ""The World According to Garp."""
506896,False,"A brilliant, inspiring film that speaks of courage, happiness, sorrow, love and loss. I liked the transition of events that took place in the film, the symbols and the ideologies. We are shown amazing character growth; it was portrayed beautifully. If you're looking for a movie that can make you laugh and cry, too, Forrest Gump is the one for you."
506897,False,"Its not a movie ,its a inspiration of life. The best movie I have seen-ever. Tom hanks is outstanding as always .The story,Music,Cinematography is brilliant. Its a movie which force you to think about your journey of life twice.For me its hundred times."
506898,False,"Simply, the best film at any point made.Funniness, bitterness, activity, dramatization and a Vietnam film all moved into one.I'm not a stone frosty, coldblooded scalawag, but rather it takes a considerable measure to influence me to cry when I watch a motion picture. Bambi's mom, I couldn't mind less. Jimmy Stewart in, ""Goodness, what a magnificent life,"" - better believe it right! The Lion King, when Mufasa croaks - almost there.Be that as it may, genuinely - I bellowed my huge dark colored eyes out, on a few events in this film. A genuine tragedy, and a brilliant character, played to flawlessness by Tom Hanks. Just as commendable for the Oscar as Rooney was to win the Premiership in 2007.I can't state it enough: This is THE film ever. Watch it, and you'll see."
506899,False,"This a powerful movie with a strong message that inspires people to achieve their dreams and that the sky is the limit. There is a bit of Forrest Gump in all of us. It's an inspirational movie about love, loyalty and kindness. It shows that there is a hero in all of us, too. Forrest Gump teaches us with his kindness that there is hope and glory in all human being."
506900,False,"As is asked from IMDb to make a review and this was the first movie that called me to write something, I'm going to quote Melanie Griffith as Honey Whitlock in Cecil B. Demented ""I f*cking hate Forrest Gump!"". John Waters is a genius for writing that relatable line and I can't wait for everyone to stop praising this and similar films, I know people can like or dislike what they want, but I also have the right to be annoyed at their opinions and have my own. By the way, can one curse in reviews here? I was scared to type f u c k i n g and be banned or something lmao."
506901,False,"Forrest Gump, a comedy and drama film that takes people through history seeing the world through Forrest Gump's (Tom Hanks) eyes. A simple, optimistic, man, with a low IQ score sits at a bus stop as he narrates his flashbacks. It all begins from a young age when his mother, Mrs. Gump (Sally Field) taught him to choose his own destiny. Throughout childhood, Forrest spends his days growing up, going to school and running around with the love of his life, Jenny Curan (Robin Wright). As time progresses, and strangers come and go from the bench and Forrest narrates his experiences from joining the army in Vietnam and making friends with his shrimp- crazed friend, Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) to developing a passion for ping pong and meeting several presidents. While getting to know Forrest's character, the theme of choosing your own destiny captivates viewers as they watch Forrest create his own history. The use of motifs and narration carry out the theme from the opening scene. The film opens up to a feather drifting aimlessly in the air, before landing on Forrest's foot. The feather, that appears again later in the film, is a motif that symbolizes Forrest as he aimlessly goes through life, creating his own destiny wherever the world takes him. Retelling his life events, as he narrates the flashback scenes allows viewers to quickly pick up on Forrest's personality. Although his IQ score is low, it is clear that he is in fact very intelligent and chooses to see the good in situations. While Forrest may be saying one thing, his flashbacks give the audience more depth and layers to the plot. Special effects position historical characters throughout the film to uniquely communicate the passage of time. As his life changes, he doesn't worry about a thing, other than his love for his long- time friend, Jenny. By not letting anything get in his way, Forrest keeps his mother's lessons in mind, and chooses his own destiny that makes you stop and consider what is truly important in life. The use of motifs, flashbacks and Forrest's narrating on the bench helps you fall in love with this simple character and his journey through life. All aspects of this movie are carefully thought out and allow the viewer to interpret and consider a deeper message, giving this film the ability to be comical, entertaining and thought provoking."
506902,False,"This is a great family movie and will never get old, is an all-time classic. one of Tom Hanks best performances.The movie is set back in the early years, and seen through the eyes of Forrest (Tom Hanks) as a young boy with physical disabilities who grows up to become an inspiration to all people he encounters throughout his life.This movie kept me and my kids entertained the whole time. Gary Sinise co-stars as Lieutenant Dan Taylor.Strongly recommend!!!2 Thumbs Up."

Don't watch or read to many reviews, just go in blind and be amazed about the movie!"
506904,False,"Forest Gump is one of those timeless movies that will never go out of style. It's a feel good movie that everyone should watch, at least, once in their life. Tom Hanks does an amazing job portraying the lead character. This is a movie I will definitely watch for years to come. All aspects of the movie are incredibly well done. From the casting to directing to the set and costumes there are no parts of this movie that aren't done super well."
506905,False,"Absolutely beautiful film in every sense of the word. An incredible use of a narrator to tell a story, fantastic but simple VFX for its time and such a perfect performance by Tom Hanks. The film takes the audience through an inspiring story about a character who had a very difficult childhood. There are so many metaphors used in the film but so subtly."
506906,False,This movie is up in my top ten movies that I absolutely love. It touches my heart. Forrest was such a sweetheart. Everyone needs a little Forrest in their life. Life is like a box of chocolates. This movie makes me appreciate life. Some may say Forrest was dumb; but he was actually smart. I think all men need to be like Forrest. But just remember to bring me a box of chocolates.
506907,False,"This is one of my most favorite movies of all time. It was a beautiful movie with a powerful message and if you haven't seen it, you need to because you've been missing out!

A lot of laughs, pitiful parts, serious moments, and intriguing scenes combined into a jumble of greatness, Awesome movie! definitely, watch it!

It has critical characters, unforgettable lines, and laugh out loud moments that will make you laugh each time you watch it. it's genuinely awesome!"
506909,False,"Nothing to say about this Movie-Hopping more just like this :)Hello. My name's Forrest--Forrest Gum.Do you want a chocolate? I could eat about a million and a half of these. My mama always said Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get. Those must be comfortable shoes. I bet you could walk all day in shoes like that and not feel a thing. I wish I had shoes like that. My feet hurt . Mama always said there's an awful lot you can tell about a person by their shoes. Where they're going,where they've been. I've worn lots of shoes. I bet if I think about it real hard I could remember my first pair of shoes.Mama said they'd take me anywhere . Gum She said they was my magic shoes. All right, Forrest, Open your eyes now Let's take a little walk around.How do those feel? His legs are strong, Mrs. Gum,as strong as I've ever seen.But his back's as crooked as a politician.But we're going to straighten him right up, aren't we, Forrest? Forrest! Now, when I was a baby,Mama named me after the great Civil War hero.General Nathan Bed ford Forrest. General Nathan Bed ford Forrest. She said we was related to him in some way.What he did was,he tarted up this club called the Clue Clue Klan.They'd all dress up in their robes and their bed sheets and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or something.They'd even put bed sheets on their horses and ride around.And, anyway, that'show I got my name-- Forrest Gum.Mama said the Forrest part was to remind me that sometimes we all do things that, well,that just don't make no sense.This way. Hold on. Ugh! All right.What are y'all staring at? Haven't you ever seen a little boy with braces on his legs before ? Don't ever let anybody tell you they're better than you, Forrest.If God intended everybody to be the same, he'd have given us all braces on our legs.Mama always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them. We lived about a quarter mile off Route 17,about a half mile from the town of Green bow, Alabama.That's in the county of Green bow. Our house had been in Mama's family since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa had come across the ocean about a thousand years ago.Since it was just me and Mama and we had all these empty rooms,Mama decided to let those rooms out, mostly to people passing through, Like from, oh, Mobile, Montgomery, places like that.That'show me and Mama got money.Mama was a real smart lady. Remember what I told you, Forrest.You're no different than anybody else is. Did you hear what I said, Forrest? You're the same as everybody else. You are no different. Your boy's...different, Mrs. Gum.His I.Q is 75. Well, we're all different."
506910,False,"I saw this movie a few years ago with my family and really enjoyed it and I recently watched it again and WOW what an amazing story of how one man over came many obstacles that where put in his. To me this movie was one of Tom Hanks best performance I have ever seen, he played the character of Forrest so well that it made you really feel as if Tom hanks was the Forrest. Just an amazing movie and a must see!!!!!"
506911,False,"The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels.

Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend, he moves you with his character. Words don't grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys' tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright.I feel that much of Gumps' appeal is his downright sense of doing the right thing regardless of the people and situations around him and we see that in this film. That being the case maybe we all wish we could be just a little more like that, trying to maintain innate goodness and not the trade-offs we often make as we go down lifes highways.The movie has it all too,drama,comedy and it challenges societal norms as well. Then there are the almost endless quotes from the movie that have slipped into everyday speech. They are too numerous to say at this point.One of the toppers for me in the movie is when Forrest is in a quandary about life and wondering as Lt.Dan said we all have a destiny and his Mom says it is where we are all just floating around like a feather in the wind. Forrest's character terms it very well with this quote,""I think it is a little bit of both."" From my experiences in life it does appear to be that way. So if you have not seen the movie,see it soon you are in for a real treat. If you did not like it, give it a try again and hopefully you will see it for the great story it is!"
506912,False,"2. Positives: it's a movie which can makes you feel sad and happy and others feels in all sequences. Also it represents clearly some of the historical events that the main character has to deal with.3. Negatives: This movie is a critic of the American society between 1960 and 1980 like the Vietnam War or the hippies. 4. Conclusion: It's a very good film because the drama and comedy that complains in the movie. I would recommend this movie because it's a good to learn it.-Plot summary: Forrest Gump is a guy with mild mental retardation.

506913,False,"Its a nice free flowing movie, means, you will have to wait for what is coming next. Although its a kind of absurd movie. All the stories are not believable, but still the flow is so nice that living seat or changing channel becomes hard. I would give it 10/10 but couldn't because of the absurdity and moreover, the length of the movie. I think the movie could be bit shorter. Anyway, I'll suggest, especially for who enjoy lighthearted movies, to seat back and enjoy the show!"
506914,False,"An all time classic! Tom Hanks best performance!This film will probably be the most quoted for years to come - ""Life's like a box of chocolates...""IF you have not seen this, BUY the DVD and add it to your collection to pass down to your grand kids.

506915,False,Such a classic movie. There's only a handful of movies that your children's children children will know about and this is one of them. The relationship between Forrest and Jenny is undeniably bitter-sweet. Forrest's mother was definitely one of a kind. She did whatever she needed to make sure Forrest had the same opportunities in life.

The movie has every single scene you would want in a movie it follows the main characters life perfectly, has a good character arc and leaves you wanting more.From start to finish the viewer becomes emotionally invested whether you want it or not. Casting couldn't be better and i am not even a Tom Hanks fan also the directing is just how it should be done. A must see film for all movie lovers would highly recommend."
506917,False,"Tom Hanks is at his best, and has probably secured his place in motion picture history with this film. Simply one of the most entertaining and inventive movies of our time,for both it's content and it's humorous perspective on the major events of recent history. Lawrence Kasdan has hit a home run hear, with memorable characters we cannot help but bond with. With all of the historical tragedies it covers, it still leaves the viewer full of hope and good will at the end. Simply a masterpiece of our time."
506918,False,"There aren't many movies that film connoisseurs would recommend, but Forrest Gump on everyone's top ten. It is a hilarious parody with an emotional emphasis that has surprising twists and turns surrounding the astounding and instantaneously lovable fictitious character famously named Forrest Gump. Take a look at the 1.37 million reviews on the IMDb page right now, how many movies can you say are rated 8.8/10 with that sum of people? It is so unbelievably rare to see a community so harsh as movie reviewers and critics to agree and almost unanimously name it a 'must see'.It is a classic that everyone should watch. It only takes the first five minutes to get you hooked and believe me, you'll be quoting the movie for the rest of your life. I know I have."
506919,False,Forrest Gump will forever be a classic film for the ages. There is something about a film where you watch a character start from childhood and watch as they engage in wonderful adventures as they age. Great acting in this film. The casting is spot on. Tom Hanks takes the lead character and makes it his own and gives the audience an emotional mind. There are so many great moments in this film and it gives the audience a lot to think about. Great cinematography in here as well. Just a great overall film.
506920,False,"I have never seen a character like Forrest Gump in a movie before.. Most movies who have extremely different and awesome story are either based on novels or Real life. This movie is based on a novel called Forrest Gump written by Winston Groom, published in 1986. The story is one of the most perfect combination of love, hope and effort to overcome hardships. The movie is presented in the most relaxing way possible making it one of the all time classics. The screen play is simply carved to perfection."
506921,False,Very intuitive and touching story. The story line was incredible funny and intriguing. Forrest was someone away from our lives yet his honesty and love was way beyond his brain development. He was interesting and motivating enough to keep me think and laugh all the time. It's his dedication to everything and his steadfast love make him a person who kept making magic happen. No doubt one of the most successful movie in past 30 years.
506922,False,"I love this movie, its funny and sad at the same time! Tom Hanks is an Amazing actor! this movie is full of iconic quotes such as ""Momma always said ,life was like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get"" and ""I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is"" . it also created the Bubba Gump seafood restraint chain . so if you have not seen this movie I'd ""Run,Forest,run"" to buy it!"
506923,False,It is a classic movie to understand how simple life can be. You have a story through time that a simple child can understand without being scared. It gives a joyous appreciate of life itself. I have seen this movie numerous times and it still effects me the same with tears. It is a great family movie.
506924,False,"I've never met anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before, and for that matter I've never seen a movie quite like ""Forrest Gump."" Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream."
506925,False,I love this movie.Great sound track.Makes me cry but also makes me so happy.Best movie ever.<3
506926,False,The most charming movie you will ever watch. The simple perceptions seen through Forrest are a refreshing voice in a chaotic and turbulent time in American history. One of those movies you will randomly turn on and never be able to turn off. Forrest Gump is Tom Hanks at his best. The plot is rich and emotional with a pleasantly optimistic undertone despite contrasting storyline.
506927,False,"Converted into a classic of the 90's and for me in a classic of all time, Forrest Gump is a story that marvels, excites, amuses all types of public. It tells the story of the United States through a poor backward named Forrest who is involved in the great events that have occurred in the ""country of opportunity"", with a realistic look at the Vietnam War and other more fantastic ones such as The birth of large companies (such as Apple). But what most envelops me is the background story of love, with an almost unreachable Jenny, which keeps the viewer on the verge of tears in several scenes. (Exciting when he asks for marriage) Notable performances, Hanks was born for this role, great is Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan, plus special effects first hand, necessary to be able to tell us the dynamic and fun story of North America seen through Forrest's eyes. There are phrases that are immortalized such as ""Run Forrest, Run !!!!"" Or ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to play .."", make this movie a masterpiece of cinema of all time."
506928,False,Forrest Gump is a childhood favorite for me watching growing up. I a fan of Tom Hanks. He did a great job. I was inspired and I would hope others would be inspired by this film also knowing you are only limited by what you allow and tell yourself to be. Thank you for reading my review.
506929,False,"For the time being Forrest Gump is one of the most intuitive movies for building success not even thinking about it. It's charming and pure. Still working for the Millennials, it will add value for each generation passing. In my opinion Forrest Gump will be a milestone in motivational movies around the world, even in the first three decades of the 21st century. As for the magisterial acting of Tom Hanks, for me this can be considered as ""boarding for an other reality"" as long as his art breaks our reality barriers."
506930,False,"This movie is a classic! It shows how some of the most simple minds are capable of the highest compassion. It is a little long for a movie now in days but I still enjoy it. The bonds Forrest shares with his mother and Jenny are raw and beautiful. SPOILER! After the death of his mother, Forrest is completely lost but still remains strong and throughout all this is still caring about Jenny. It's hard to watch just how much Forrest is always thinking of Jenny and yet she is off in her own adventure without much worry for Forrest."
506931,False,"I loved this movie because after watching it I realized that life really is like a box of chocolates, you will never know exactly what your gonna get.It makes you think about the differences we have as people and makes you open your eyes to the people the don't ""fit in"". I also like the fact that it shows you that no matter what you situation, you can change it and go after your dreams."
506932,False,"This film is my all time favorite,mind blowing performance by Tom Hanks. One of the best movie in Hollywood ever made. The best part of this movie is the way of telling the story. It's a movie about life and emotions we all go through at one time or another in life. A movie like this only comes once a lifetime.And this movie definitely deserved its Oscar for Best Picture."
506933,False,"God gives us a destiny, but we have the right to choose. It can be a talent given by the cause of it, but a talent that is earned afterwards, but we must never give up, God always knows the best and the best, The episodes and explosions are spectacular. I'm in love with the script."
506934,False,"As a lover of history, this movie was a breath of fresh air when it came out. It takes moments of history and makes them happenstance for one man completely unaware. It really drives home the narrative and to this day I still enjoy watching it. If you like lite comedies with a deeper meaning and some historical reference, this movie is for you"
506935,False,"Forrest Gump is a classic movie of all time. Hat's off to the man Tom Hanks. A movie which needs to be watched by every single one irrespective of his/her age. It melts your heart and takes you back to your childhood days and teenage too. Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks) narrates his story in a park to various people. His story is one of its kind which brings you hope when you lose it. With various interpretations of certain events which took part in his life one can relate to his own life. A movie which should be seen by all cinema lovers, sooner or later. It is quite emotional at times. A classic it is."
506936,False,"Great family movie, with laughter, sadness and a great cast and better acting, a true classic.This film takes you through the history of out country as well as traveling around the world. Very entertaining and yet educational all at the same time. Well written movie that keeps you entertained and wandering what's next, without giving anything away. The action movie fast enough to keep you engaged, yet slow enough for even the youngest to keep up with the story line."
506937,False,"I looked over 480 films. Rate each. This film has left a huge impression on me. The best film ever made. Tom Hanks perfectly staged his own role. A film that leaves no one indifferent. I would recommend it to anyone. The story, actors, duration, drama, all in one place. The moment when you talk to her mother, the scene before her death, I cried like a little child. I rated it with pure 10!"
506938,False,"This film can be watched by anyone in the family who can speak; I enjoyed this movie as a boy because it was one of the only stories of a child then the man who did well in life. Now, all we hear about is how people have done well with startups and websites. This movie shows with love and care you can still rise to the top"
506939,False,"The first time I watched Forrest gump, I thought to myself ""golly what a bad film"" then i watched it a second time, just yesterday. and thought ""hrmm, this film is better than I remembered""the film centres around the titular Forrest gump, a possible mentally disabled man who touches the hearts of many, and influences many historical events in his life, from Vietnam to football.my main grievance of this film is the way that everything in Forrest's world exists to make you feel sad. everything that happens to him is supposed to make you cry or feel bad for him. whenever something nice happens to him, there's a big ol' SCREW YOU FORREST right behind it. sure, it is supposed to be a sad tale, but it gets to a point where you just want to give the poor guy a break for once. HOWEVER, this is also the best part about the film, Forrest's unawareness of his hardships and how friendly he is really makes you root for him, its a real success story. I felt like some of the ""cameos"" Forrest made in historical events were a bit silly. but that's just me i suppose.I liked it. great film with a few little hiccups.8/10 for sure at least."
506940,False,This movie has to be an all time favorite. Watching Forrest grow up into a wonderful young man is probably one of the best things about this movie. Once you start watching you don't want to stop! Tom Hanks does a wonderful job of portraying Forrest and it has probably been one of his greatest moments in movie history.
506941,False,"Forrest Gump is a classic movie and one of my favorite movies of all time. The movie shows the life of Forrest Gump through a variety of lenses and each time it carries a simple, yet profound message. It feels like a never-ending journey through life but becoming increasingly more interesting through each new phase. This is a movie which will make you feel good about humanity and maybe make you into a better person.Tom Hanks delivers an exceptional performance as Forrest Gump. There is excellent character development shown. I think the best part of his character is that despite the various obstacles he faces, his good heart and mindset always lets him continuously improve his life. His sincerity and simplicity is touching and allows the viewer to connect on every level with Forrest Gump. I also appreciate this film for being able to weave the life of an individual with the historical and social background of the relevant time periods. There are some explicit historical scenes, such as the Vietnam War scenes, and they are filmed well. The social class subtleties embedded in such scenes are interesting as well. I am sure if I watch this film another time, I will notice even more noteworthy details pertaining to social issues. This film avoids the dilemma of not being historically accurate because it does not have to be - Forrest Gump creates the history himself."
506942,False,"Excellent movie, excellent character transformation and excellent story and best way to tell that story, narrating a period of time in American history! One of the best movies of all times! Tom Hanks gives the performance of a lifetime, there's not a person in the world that has seen this movie that does not fall inlove with Forrest Gump."
506943,False,"This is a refreshing feel-good movie that is always fun and charming. The story is about a man who gets accidentally involved in some of the biggest impacts of 20th century. In this film you will find a captivating story of innocence and optimism. A terrific performance from Tom Hanks who portrays Forrest Gump, a man with a low I.Q., makes this film an influential one that will make the audience both cheer and learn valuable things about that character"
506944,False,"This movie tugs on the heart strings showing an emotional story of a slow witted man that goes through many hardships in his life. From being bullied as a young child, to fighting in the Vietnam war. The movie is well written and directed amazingly. I highly recommend watching."
506945,False,"I was watching this movie for many times and never got boring...so inspirational and give us more spirit. So many part that we can learn from this one, like war is bad choice for everyone in the world no matter what they are. I like opening apart from this movie, when Forrest Gump (tom hanks) waiting the bus and told his history to everyone that waiting for the bus too. He don't care what people think about him. Friendship, loyalty, happiness, sadness, nasionalism, family, childhood all this stuff is in this movie. And if u are looking for the truth love, you must watch this one,and don't cry, not for the sadness but for the loyalty that Forrest have."
506946,False,"I truly adore this story, the characters, the plot.. Everything. The actors starring in this film are so incredibly believable, and true. With stories which will both tear your heart apart, or help you keep faith, Forrest Gump is truly a gem. Following this fellow throughout his life, as he narrates it, is truly remarkable to behold. You feel as if you are experiencing it all with him, and all the twists and turns through it all makes you feel things you never thought you should. After watching this film the first time I felt as though to go out on an adventure, see people, follow the river where it took me. This film is something I haven't seen since, it has created this special place in my heart. One of my all time favourites; bravo to the crew making it!"
506947,False,"Quite simply, the greatest film ever made.Humour, sadness, action, drama and a Vietnam film all rolled into one.I'm not a stone cold, heartless villain, but it takes a lot to make me cry when I watch a movie. Bambi's mother, I couldn't care less. Jimmy Stewart in, ""Oh, what a wonderful life,"" - yeah right! The Lion King, when Mufasa bites the big one - on the verge.But seriously - I bawled my big brown eyes out, on several occasions in this film. A real tear-jerker, and a wonderful character, played to perfection by Tom Hanks. Every bit as worthy for the Oscar as Rooney was to win the Premiership in 2007.I cannot say it enough: This is THE film of all time. Watch it, and you'll see."
506948,False,"Forrest Gump is a classic fable that makes you love it . Every bit of the movie surprises you on a different note . Looking back at the movie, the movie contains more of drama, and has it's share of notable comedy.Scripts are well written to keep the users guessing . What made the movie so good was the star of the show Tom Hanks. There was a display of effortless acting from him .To get the best out of the movie. It's best to just watch it with a fresh mind. It is a tad bit different from other movies, but that was which made the movie a success. Hats off to the cast and crew for their wonderful development."
506949,False,When I first saw this movie I didn't appreciate it like I do now. I think it may have been because I was so young when I first saw it. Just recently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. That life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. That we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there's no hope... I just love this movie. And anyone who hasn't seen it or who thinks that don't like it I seriously suggest seeing it or seeing it again. It truly is amazing.
506950,False,"We all know the lines about the box of chocolates and Forrest running, but why? The reason we all remember that and the many other moments of this masterpiece is due to how intriguing they all are. What makes this film so captivating is the unique and fleshed out characters who all can be described in detail by anyone who even glances at this film. Also the way the film is told, while not original, is done well thanks to Forrest speaking before the camera cuts to him, which prevents the feeling of interruption, thus making the film feel smoother. Also they structure allows the viewers to get deep into Forrest's thoughts, which allows the viewer to feel like he truly knows him. Also the edit historical footage is very convincing, which helps create a dream like feel, which helps since this film is basically the American Dream in a nutshell. The only complaint I have with this film is a boat changing direction on its own (you will know what I mean when you watch this)"
506951,False,"This here is just as good as you may've heard, it's one of those films that develop legendary status as the years and decades pile on, and it delivers on the quality expected from all the hype. The story is based on a novel, which explains the excellent structure of the plot but the directing was very competent in making this a moving, genuinely thought-provoking and interesting piece of art. It belongs in the category of long, drama films, but it never gets 'long' and the 'drama' never gets over-dramatic. The tension is excellently managed, the acting is very good, and in spite of its said long run-time the films is filled with events, meaningful characters and very good dialog, and it never concedes to self-complacency - objectively this is strong cinema through and through. True quality. The Gary Sinise character who represents the human ego, and Gump as a symbol that intelligence of the heart is infinitely superior and more valuable than intelligence of the mind. The only true concern for an easy-going, indulgent movie viewer is that the film builds such tremendous momentum, is so flawlessly told and crafted, that one would certainly expect an adequately superb finish, an emphatic ultimate exclamation point; not something extraordinarily life-changing but something rich in the same emotion and genuinely interesting/profound quality the whole film as a platform had built seamlessly for two hours plus. Such great classic stories end with a beautiful and fulfilling sense of utter satisfaction, and this does seem to fall slightly short of that, so it may not merit a full grade. 8.5/10."
506952,False,"This movie is an instant classic, never met anyone who hasn't enjoyed it. It keeps you engaged from start to finish and the characters are all very well written and acted. This is one of those movies that I'll stop and watch any time I find it on! Tom Hanks did a wonderful job in the lead role and made a lasting impression. This script is one that is quoted in all walks of life, everyone knows at least one line from this movie whether they've seen it or not. It is *mostly* child appropriate and kids that sit and pay attention can keep up with the story line. For adults it isn't at all difficult to follow. This movie will have you thinking about your own life experiences and really delving in to thought."
506953,False,"This is the story of a simple man and his ability to be in the right place at the time of an important event in USA recent history. We've got Elvis Presley, the Vietnam War, Apple computers, jogging and the HIV aids epidemic. It's all here wrapped up in a delightful story with Forest stumbling or running from one event to the next. The cast are fabulous with Tom Hanks playing Forrest and Gary Sinise, Robin Wright, Sally Field and Mykelti Williamson ably supporting. The production values are amazing with each era being instantly recognisable from the costumes, music and sets. The direction by Robert Zemeckis is wonderful as all the production could have smothered the story but instead we are allowed to go on a magical journey through with life with Forrest."
506954,False,"This is a movie that I have seen many times . It is always good to see that . It's a good movie .I mean a great movie i have ever seen. the artist did very good. And the story was also very well. Tom Hanks is the person who did his job very well. Their is so many good things in this movie. But also some bad things i don't like. But overall this movie is great.Their is so many things about to talk of this movie.but everybody know how the movie is. So i don't thing that i have to say more about the movie.The movie has it all too,drama,comedy and it challenges societal norms as well. Then there are the almost endless quotes from the movie that have slipped into everyday speech. They are too numerous to say at this point.One of the toppers for me in the movie is when Forrest is in a quandary about life and wondering as Lt.Dan said we all have a destiny and his Mom says it is where we are all just floating around like a feather in the wind. Forrest's character terms it very well with this quote,""I think it is a little bit of both."" From my experiences in life it does appear to be that way. So if you have not seen the movie,see it soon you are in for a real treat. If you did not like it, give it a try again and hopefully you will see it for the great story it is!"
506955,False,"A movie that change (in its time) the perspective of every event, from the re-creation of acts for other purposes, to it interesting relation with a ""realistic fiction"". Tale a story through historical and adding it own ""historical fact"" in the history of cinematography.It seems like a master piece that exposes genius and actually is at the same time. Characters that also, appear like ghosts and stay like memories. A real revolution that represent the reality, in the most impossible way, but being true: a false chronicle. A large feather that falls over my eyes and which actually doesn't exist, but I remember it like it was mine."
506956,False,"You never know what you're gonna get"". Those are the words of wisdom that come from Forrest Gumps Mouth. Directed By Robert Zemeckis, and starring Tom Hanks(in his greatest performance) as Forrest Gump, tells the story of the unintelligent Forrest Gump, and shows his struggles with the world, as the result of his innocence. The Score is beautiful and the opening scene is just tragically well filmed. The Cinematography is fantastic, and it captures the humour and the sadness of the Film. The Special Effects are incredible, especially for 1994. Forrest Gump deserved every award it got(best picture, best actor),and it's IMDb score reflects the greatness of this film, that will last as won of the best films of the 90's.Tom Hanks, who was awarded best actor for his performance, is at the peak of his game as Forrest Gump. Once the Movie is done, you're sure to believe Tom Hanks IS Forrest Gump. One of the most convincing performances of all time.10/10."
506957,False,"This film has it all! Action, drama, comedy and more, the type of film you can watch over and over again and love it just the same. Not only is the movie itself great, but it comes with a fantastic soundtrack as well. This film was released when I was still in high school. I liked it so much that my friends and I decided to do a remake of it (a much shorter version with select scenes) in our TV production class. Tom Hanks does an amazing job in this film portraying Forrest Gump, you can really get into his character and really believed that he could do all these things. I own the two-disc cd set of the soundtrack and I love pretty much every song on it. This is one of those films that will go down in history as one of the greatest ever."
506958,False,"Life like box of chocolate. You never know what the inside is... and after i listen this quotes... i'm speechless...I don't want review too long. For what ? It's brilliant movie and strong of moral lesson and positive person to-warding Forrest Gump ( Tom Hanks ). So... this film is set beautifully, strong, full of lesson that a low- frequency of IQ can make world see him...as long i watched this movie, i didn't found any errors or anything. only anarchoisms that i found it. But, this great movie makes me forget what is the goof are ? Plus this movie winning multiple Oscars. it was 6 Oscars.end review"
506959,False,"Wow, what a movie it is. It's been years since i've watched it for the first time, and i was speechless. I've seen many movies, many of them i watched over and over again, but Forrest Gump is one of my favourite one. Tom Hanks deservedly won an Oscar for his role, he's outstanding, the rest of the crew isn't far behind, and directing is a master-class. Robert Zemeckis pulls all the strings and makes this masterpiece his best movie so far. You have everything in this movie - from comedy to drama, you'll be laughing and crying and the same time. Highly recommended, but i doubt there's someone out there that haven't seen this beautiful movie... Forgot to add, best watched with loved one :)"
506960,False,"This Movie is in my opinion one of the best, if not the best, movie ever. It delivers so many emotions. Its amazing how a movie can make one actually feel with the protagonist that much! Forrest Gump, the protagonist, is not very bright, still her manages to live a fulfilled live and archives things, that many people only can dream about. All that he does with his hat in his hands. Tom Hanks manages to bring Forrest Gump to life, he delivers an outstanding actor performance. Through that, one can actually feel what Forrest Gump feels, that makes this movie so emotional. His strenght and ability to never give up and let live bring one down is delivered very well and inspires the viewer, me at least, a lot."
506961,False,"It's one of those rare movies that everyone has seen and just about everyone loves. It's a classic and it's not hard to see why. The movie takes on the simpleness of it's title character, Forrest Gump. It's not flashy, it's simple, and the simpleness is beautiful. It isn't just a story of a man, but of the generation he was apart of. The brilliance of how these two different elements are put together is what makes Forrest Gump the lovable and great movie it is.If you're one of the few people who haven't seen Forrest Gump, all I can say is, watch it. I don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but I, I think maybe it's both. Maybe both is happening at the same time. I miss you Jenny. If there's anything you need. I won't be far away."
506962,False,"Forrest Gump is a movie heart-breaker of oddball wit and startling grace. There's talk of another Oscar for Tom Hanks, who is unforgettable as the sweet-natured, shabbily treated simpleton of the title. The Academy is a sucker for honoring afflicted heroes. In Hollywood, it's always raining rain men. Credit Hanks for not overplaying his hand. He brings a touching gravity to the role of an idiot savant from the South who finds strength in God, country, his childhood pal, Jenny (Robin Wright), and his good mama (Sally Field). When Forrest falls a few IQ points shy of minimal school requirements, Mama knows who to sleep with to bend the rules. Her son has a gift. As Forrest makes his pilgrim's progress from the '50s to the '80s, he becomes a college football star, a Vietnam war hero, a shrimp tycoon and even a father.Taking a cue from Zelig, director Robert Zemeckis places Forrest in a vivid historical context  he talks with JFK, LBJ and Nixon, among other luminaries. The effects dazzle, though never at the expense of the story. Winston Groom, who wrote the 1986 novel, saw Forrest as a modern Candide, an optimist in the face of strong opposing evidence. But Groom is no Voltaire, and neither is screenwriter Eric Roth (Mr. Jones, Memories of Me), who blunts his satire with choking sentiment. It's Hanks who brings humor and unforced humanity to the literary conceit of Forrest, though the slim actor scarcely resembles the 6-foot-6-inch, 240-pound bruiser of the book.In a college dorm with Jenny, who lets him touch her breast, the virginal Forrest ejaculates instantly, losing her interest and his self-respect. In the Army, Forrest saves his captain (Gary Sinise), whose legs are later amputated, and the captain resents him. Forrest is everything we admire in the American character  honest, brave, loyal  and the film's fierce irony is that nobody can stay around him for long.Zemeckis doesn't fall into the trap of using Forrest as an ad for arrested development. He knows the limits of a holy fool who can't understand the hypocrisy of postwar America that this picaresque epic so powerfully reveals. The peace-love pretensions of the '60s are skewered as neatly as the greed decades that follow. But there is something of Forrest that Zemeckis would like to see rub off on us: his capacity for hope. It's an ambitious goal in this age of rampant cynicism. Godspeed."
506963,False,"The moment you see that the protagonist is Tom Hanks, you know this movie's gonna be great- and it is ! Everything works in this movie- The music, the acting, the story, the dialog, the romance, the drama, the humor.... Everything works flawlessly !! Hanks is absolutely magnificent, his character is fantastic !! After watching this film, I really think Tom Hanks could be the next DiCaprio !! He can act so dramatic at one minute, the other minute he can be so hilarious you won't believe how excellent he can act !! Also, every character works. I won't spoil anything but even if something happens to a curtain character and you don't cry, you'll still think the actor did a great job portraying the character. This film deserves 10/10, it's impossible to feel bored in this movie, every second you can either laugh hysterically, feel so invested in the story and the dialog, or even cry when something sad happens. This film is a must watch !!!"
506964,False,"The movie is very funny. The movie get Oscar-winner in 1994.And the movie get many awards. The movie's Director is Robert Zemeckis. The plot is arrange parts and design very well. The main character is Tom HanKs that is outstanding actor. The quote is ""Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."" That mean is today do thing, and you don't know will chance things. The movie is talking Forrst Gump all life. He is a bad lucky boy. And he have a dream. So, he is courageous and brave. He is soldier. Don't afraid anything. The end of soldier story. Next, he is a runner. He ran around the world in the movie end. So, he have persist himself of dreaming and never give up. Finally, if you have a dream, you go to do immediately and must coming true. Adding information, you are attracted by the movie. Touch you heart. So, the movie is everyone worth watching again."
506965,False,"I have watched this movie in Spanish class when I was in high school. At first I didn't like it , but towards the end I did. The way he portrayed his character was really good. I didn't expect for him to do that. I love how he got his accent down. It was really a nice movie to watch. It was entertaining but then again boring for me to watch because I didn't really understand it. I would recommend it to anyone else though if they like movies like that. Even if they just want to see him play someone else for a change. Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors. This is one of his best films, the one I like best I think is the one where he was on the beach. Cast away"
506966,False,Forrest Gump is a story of acceptance and understanding one that opens your eyes while still being the most classic version of a love story. Each of the characters in this movie is dynamic and worth watching. They all have such different paths the ultimately intertwine and the central point where they meet is him. This boy who becomes a man with a heart as big as they come and a mind thats sharp in its own right. Never to be taken for granted Forrest is a one of a kind character and human being and this movie is iconic. It teaches all of us that what makes you different doesn't make you strange it makes you powerful in your own right and anyone who does not believe that our applaud that has no place in your life.
506967,False,"Run Forrest Run!!! If u didn't watch this movie, I seriously suggest you to watch this movie ASAP. It shows a person with no special abilities can also be a world class person (receiving awards from American Presidents). ""A stupid is as stupid does"" one line that forrest recites every time remembering his mother. This has a lot of meaning in it. She insists her son not to agree with anyone who says "" I am better than you"". As a little boy forrest with a low IQ and problem in the spine faces a lot of problems with the society. But, his mother has a strong desire to get the best for his Son. In his childhood, he got to meet a little girl of his age who is the only friend of him in his entire childhood. They grew up together but takes two paths which are quite opposite. Forrest goes into the army and then into the VERY successful shrimp business and had become one of the richest persons. He is a natural guy who has no special qualities but, that becomes his special."
506968,False,"""Stupid is as stupid does,"" says Forrest Gump (played by Tom Hanks in an Oscar-winning performance) as he discusses his relative level of intelligence with a stranger while waiting for a bus. Despite his sub-normal IQ, Gump leads a truly charmed life, with a ringside seat for many of the most memorable events of the second half of the 20th century. Entirely without trying, Forrest teaches Elvis Presley to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Yippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years. Meanwhile, as the remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest never forgets Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), the girl he loved as a boy, who makes her own journey through the turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s that is far more troubled than the path Forrest happens upon. Featured alongside Tom Hanks are Sally Field as Forrest's mother; Gary Sinise as his commanding officer in Vietnam; Mykelti Williamson as his ill-fated Army buddy who is familiar with every recipe that involves shrimp; and the special effects artists whose digital magic place Forrest amidst a remarkable array of historical events and people."
506969,False,"This is a good movie for what it is but I really don't know why people say it's one of the best films ever made.Forrest Gump is not a smart man but he has accidentally been present at many historical events. While sitting on a park bench, he tells strangers about what he experienced in life and the people he met.The musical score is well-done and perfectly timed. It hits all the right notes at the right time. It does a great job drawing different emotions out of the audience.Also, I think that this is a very entertaining feel-good movie. It is also pretty compelling. It has a nice message as well. It's message is that you can achieve all you can in life. It can inspire many people and it does a great job doing what it wanted to do. However, then there are the flaws.Firstly, the movie often gets crippled under its own sentimentality. I get that the movie was trying to draw emotions out of the audience but it does it too often. Its sentimental moments can be real overwhelming at times. I'm not going to spoil anything but the ending seemed to exist just to add more unnecessary sentimentality to the movie.Also, this movie is overlong and stretched-out. It could've been cut down a lot. Several scenes I felt could've been cut down or could've been completely left out altogether. I grew bored several times throughout.In conclusion, this is a pretty good movie and I like it for what it is. I just don't think it's anything special like many people say it is."
506970,False,"As much as it was sort of a quirky film, I still enjoyed watching Forrest Gump. It was very entertaining and filled with humor. This is a movie that I wouldn't mind watching once or twice a year. Tom Hanks is such a brilliant actor, he definitely deserved an Oscar nomination for the role he played. I also enjoyed watching Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan, he also brought some humor to the character. In fact, he took that role very seriously and named his tribute band, Lt. Dan Tribute Band. When this movie came out in 1994 it was a really big hit with friends in the industry. Sally Field grew into her character as well and she was brilliant in playing Mrs. Gump. I really enjoyed the scenes on the park bench, where the stories were being told. I definitely recommend this as a family movie for teens and above."
506971,False,"Funny, charming, out of this world story. Loved every second of it! It makes you laugh so hard that your belly hurts and cry your eyes out at the same time! This is the story that is hard to believe at first... But after you've seen it you don't care anymore if it's true or not. You don't even think about that! All because the movie has you now! Meet Forrest, a real person! Someone may say he is too naive to survive and all this story is like a fairytale. But I would prefer to see as much more of people like that in my life! Too naive you say? I don't care! I prefer honesty! And main character is the best in it! Enjoy! This movie is great!"
506972,False,"immensely grateful to this wonderful film , inspiring and heartbreaking for this film was that I decided to venture into the cinema, among other ... I tell you that special people come to this world has to do it !, happier in my personal experience with live person different capacities and is the joy of my life , I do not see me in another way , the movie also talks about how love affects us all , that is a good way , then as said gump , life It is like a box of chocolates you never know that you won , but you assure you that you will like , well this last does not say, but certainly is absolutely right , of course is amazing too technical level this film , I think that this stop on the hard line of the film ""commercial"" and art-house films"
506973,False,"As much as I love superhero and action movies, Forrest Gump is so far, the best movie I've seen. I loved how Tom Hanks played the role as Forrest. It was very moving. Forrest Gump's life can somehow be similar to every people's life. There will always be challenges and it could be hard but you can always go through it and succeed in life. That's what the movie is all about.Another thing is, there will be people that will help or make your life uneasy but all those people actually have a purpose, in reality and in the movie. Forrest Gump tells us that ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you'll never what you'll get."" Which in reality is also true. This movie has a lot of life lessons that you'll appreciate.In conclusion, Forrest Gump is such a great film. It has a great story and lovable characters. I gave it 9 stars because it's not the perfect movie. Maybe when I watch Pulp Fiction, The Godfather I and II or Shawshank Redemption, maybe I'll give one of those movies 10 stars."
506974,False,"Its one of the best movies I have ever seen. It can change your perception of looking towards life. The movie was full of suspense, humor, and of course a really deep story. This is one movie, which while watching you would pray that it never end. You would probably be thinking about the movie for days after watching it. No action scenes, no fairy tale love story and no mesmerizing literary phrases. Just a normal person who would mesmerize you for next three hours.My sister and me watched the movie and had a discussion on it for hours, the more you watch and think about it, the more you will get indulged in it. this movie will definitely make your day or even a week if you love movies.Don't miss it, you might regret not watching it ;)"
506975,False,"This is a great movie, with great acting. I absolutely would recommend it to anybody looking for a funny but encouraging movie. It will definitely be a classic forever. This movie has a lot more to offer than what meats the eye. There are a lot of underlying messages that you can relay to your life. I have watched this movie several times, and every time I come away with a deeper meaning and different kind of understanding on the movie and also life. I believe that movies that allow the viewer to watch it several times without becoming bored makes that movie timeless. This movie brings all great qualities into one. It started with a great concept, went to great writing, great producing, great directing, and great actors. Everyone did their part to make this movie spectacular, and it shows."
506976,False,"This movie, was always an all time favorite of mine, but now since I have gotten to know my history a little better, this film seems even more fantastic to me. There are always going to be historical errors, but there were minimal errors in this movie. This comedic romance/drama brings you through so many different emotions. Honestly this film taught me how to be grateful in so many ways, such as how in the beginning of the film when Forrest goes through his troubles but with the help of his friend, he overcame adversity and showed true brilliance in how you should always be happy with what you have. This story brought us through so many different time periods which made me realize, that with all the possible little things in life which occur that make you sad, are only temporary, while love, true love is something that can never be broken. Forrest was a man of perseverance, no matter what life threw at him, he always battled through his tough times. Which taught me to do the same whenever i encounter such bad times as Forrest did."
506977,False,"If you are thinking of seeing this movie, just do it. The amazing plot and the use of American history, Forest Gump became a simple phenomenon. He is the guy who shows the world a whole new way of understanding life. With many characters which are essential to the plot and his dumb way of thinking makes you fall in love with the movie. I totally recommend, and I guarantee that you are not going to be disappointed by the story. It seems old but the graphics are essential and will give a amazing look to the movie. Which has many scenes, that will need this old type graphics. To conclude my review, I will not give you any more about the movie, just watch it and you will know what I am talking about"
506978,False,"If you still have not seen this movie then you are missing out on a long but entertaining story of a man, Forest Gump, who makes the best of his life and every moment. Forest is an example of a great man who comes in a broken package which is often misjudged or treated. The real reason this movie is worth watching is because I believe most people can relate to Forest and his life experience. In the movie he experiences, love, hate, judgement, fear, loneliness, happiness, war, struggle, and much more is seen and experienced with the people he interacts with like racism, divorce, abuse, and physical trauma. The acting of Tom Hanks and all supporting actors is spot on, I was never pulled from the sense of belief. I truly felt a part of him and felt what he was going through."

506980,False,"At first glance, it seems a bit dimwitted Forrest, silly boy, but his kindness and simple outlook on life to persuade the audience throughout the film. Here simplicity is not worse it as a shield against unfriendly looks, she as his own credo. He just loves his mom, just to protect Jenny. He's just a good friend, he's just helping people. He just does what he likes. And for those who doubt if they were, then they evaporate when Forrest is not just a father.The whole life of Forrest -neobyknovenny kaleidoscope of situations in which it is directly or indirectly affect the course of American history, and does it unconsciously, and sometimes a child himself. He taught Elvis to dance and made him famous, he was three times at a reception at the president, he founded the «Apple Computers, Inc» and came up with the famous shirt with smiles and popular slogan «Shit happens».The Life and Strange Surprising Adventures of Forrest for me is the story of an amazing and extraordinary man. A real person. Forrest Gamp- is the quintessence of the whole person. This film is like no other, shows our world through the prism of understanding and appreciation of him as a man who is capable of a different perception, dust proof problems and cynicism. Not everyone of the people manage to see the world as it is for Forrest Gump."
506981,False,"great movieIt has a great history , worth watching with the whole family .The stories hold you in front of the film, and also make you think about life .It is now consider an old movie , but it is more than suitable for all ages and generations.Spectacular film . I think it makes us realize the true values ​​of life and how we should make good use of the time we have and be happy in spite of everything and that happiness is us who do and not something we can or we get !"
506982,False,It Was A Good Movie I liked it a lot of fun with the best thing ever I want you back to the gym with my life is a good idea of the year of high and I don't know what I do is go to the gym with my life is a good idea of the year of high and I don't know what I do it for a long day of my friends are the only way I can get the hang of this month in the morning to all the way you can do is sleep but I can't believe that the two men were arrested on suspicion of involvement in a while ago and it will not be a great way to get my life is so good at it and the rest of my friends are the only way I can get the hang of this month in the morning to all the way you can get a follow back please I love you so much fun to watch it on my phone is a great way to the gym and then you can do that for the next two weeks ago I had to be the same thing as the most beautiful thing in life are the only way I can do that for the next two days after the first half and I have a lot more than one of my life and death
506983,False,"I've never met anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before, and for that matter I've never seen a movie quite like ""Forrest Gump."" Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream.The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction, not the formulas of modern movies. Its hero, played by Tom Hanks, is a thoroughly decent man with an IQ of 75, who manages between the 1950s and the 1980s to become involved in every major event in American history. And he survives them all with only honesty and niceness as his shields.And yet this is not a heartwarming story about a mentally retarded man. That cubbyhole is much too small and limiting for Forrest Gump. The movie is more of a meditation on our times, as seen through the eyes of a man who lacks cynicism and takes things for exactly what they are. Watch him carefully and you will understand why some people are criticized for being ""too clever by half."" Forrest is clever by just exactly enough.Tom Hanks may be the only actor who could have played the role.<3 TOM HANKS <3"
506984,False,"Robert Zemeckis made some great films, but this one is the best, in terms of plot, cast, soundtrack and cinematic. Well, to begin the plot was very well written (even thought I didn't read the novel by Winston Groom), I haven't finished to read the script by Eric Roth, but I am really enjoying it. The cast was great, with the stars Tom Hanks (wich I think it was one of the best 90's actor) and Robin Wright was extremely good represented. The best acting from Tom Hanks in my opinion, better than ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""The Green Mile"". The soundtrack of the movie was very well chosen and that gave some magic effect to it. The And then the cinematic, there were really interesting moments, the ones like the war in Vietnam and the feather are some examples. In overall, this film is great, this is one of the films you should see before you die! Of course there is some people that hate it, but there are always people who hate something, I hope you enjoy watching this movie!"
506985,False,"Forrest Gump, while not intelligent, has accidentally been present at many historic moments, but his true love, Jenny Curran, eludes him. I started to watch this movie without so much enthusiasm because I had never seen before, I wanted to be who doesn't like a movie which everyone loves, just to be different. I guessed that was really easy make a good movie about a not smart guy with some mind's problem, it's a story that everyone would like. Instead I found this movie marvellous, gorgeous, interesting, charming... When I have an idea I usually keep it until the end of the movie instead in this case something changed. I really loved this movie, besides the popular sentences: ""Run, Forrest, Run!"" that is smart I enjoyed everything. I liked the choices for the songs during the whole movie, I heard Sweet Home Alabama, Free Bird, Imagine... And when Forrest met John Lennon and they began to talk about China and references about the words of Imagine songs, I laughed so much. Yes, because this is a very important movie, in several moments it was funny but in others there were deep meaning, just everything that Forrest's mom taught to him and said worth the price ticket. Besides this movie talks about how is difficult to be such a different person in our world and above all how solve this problem because Forrest Gump, with the every problem of the world became a promoted student, football player, soldier, captain, and above all he became such a good friend, husband and dad!"
506986,False,"One of my all time favorite films! One that never gets old, and you see a little more wisdom each time you watch! My favorite childhood memories with my father would be to watch this film and ask questions throughout the whole thing (which I see now is annoying) haha ooops. Forrest Gump was an inspiring man that shows a different perspective or an altered state of reality thats chilling, yet inspiring to both children and adults! If you haven't watched, this is a must see! I would love to sit around like old times and watch the film again. I plan to watch it and actually research more in depth with the symbolic meanings depicted throughout the film!"
506987,False,"the first time I ever watched this film was when I was in year 7 history class, and I've being watching it ever since, I think its a great film that shows how anything is possible and also how people can judge others really quickly. but also I think that the film is a really good film to watch and I would recommend this film to others, as its one of my all time favourite and that if you haven't watched it sit yourself down and watch it, because you are missing out on a great film So do watch this film because it also learns you about allot of cultural history in America and its just a great film to watch if your on your own or even with the family."
506988,False,"A long overdue movie experience for me.This is a great movie with another remarkable interpretation by Tom Hanks.He IS the movie.It's like a fairy tale where we can see that in spite of our shortcomings, we can always be great or a part of something great (even if we can't understand it).It is also a love story of a man chasing after his true love his entire life. On his route he finds friendship, fortune and the acknowledgment of his abilities by his friends (and not only those).In the end, without knowing it, he shows true compassion for his loved one, saving her. But in his mind she is saving him, like she always did throughout his life.It's an excellent movie in every way."
506989,False,"What a beautiful film! Capturing innocence, love and family. ""Forrest Gump"" elicits a tone of love - between a mother and son, and ultimately between a man and a woman; which results in a character development from a shy, young boy to a determined young man. Furthermore, the film conveys an underlying message that no matter who you are, you can do anything. While Forrest is not the most intelligent of men, he finds that he is more than capable, in the historic events that he finds himself in. With each event, gradually building him up as a better person. A truly stoic man. In addition, a beautiful soundtrack, goes hand-in-hand with this beautiful film. ""Run Forrest, run!"""
506990,False,"First of all, this movie can't be compared to any other movie. The duration of the movie is very good. It keeps the story to an exciting case.No nudity in the movie which I see one of Hanks characteristics, you watch a great story fits all ages. I see it as a perfect movie, integration is found in drama,music play,emotions,crying,laughing and of course in Hanks performance. In this movie you'll smile,cry and get inspired at the same time. The sequence of events and storytelling is amazing I've never experienced it in any other movie.Whatever your mood is, you'll enjoy watching it any time.Really it's a classy one. When I first saw this movie I didn't appreciate it like I do now.Because it's underrated by people but after I watched it, I found out I was mistaken."
506991,False,"Many of the movies I watched but I crowned as the most inspiring movies, MOST TOUCHING, MOST Sensational. I am very motivated and thrilled after seeing this movie. Many sentences are motivated and wise in this film, among others: ""Death is just a part of Life"" is death is seen as a loss in life but, that's life. Death is just a part of life. We can not resist even though we do not want. That's why everyone's life would be dead. ""Life Was Like A Box Chocolates. You Never Know You're Gonna Get"" is full of life mystery.Seperti brown box. You can get delicious chocolate and brown slightly sour. Brown hard and soft brown. Similarly life. There is a life full of obstacles, hindrances some are unbelievably loud and unpleasant chill did not even have to work hard has been a lot of money. All is full of mystery."
506992,False,"No matter how many times I watch this movie, it still manages to move me and take me on an adventure. I find myself always getting lost in Tom Hanks acting, it's not Tom, it's Forrest, which is something I find difficult to see when watching other actors. As a viewer you feel as if you're one of the people sitting with Forrest at the bus stop, listening to his compelling story. As the viewer, as you go on this journey with Forrest you're on a roller coaster of emotions, from happiness, sadness, anger, frustration, if a movie can make you feel all these different things, that's what I see as a successful movie, a film is supposed to connect with it's audience on an emotional level, and this movie does that on a number of levels. I'd recommend this as a must watch movie to anyone."
506993,False,"Forrest Gump is Just a perfect movie ! It is perfect from all aspects : nice Editing , good filming , wonderful acting , efficient music , astounding Script and even good visual effects (for the time that it have made). i say perfect because it has all humor, sadness, action, drama and lots of messages in it.In fact , The more you understand about this movie , the more you like it and you don't even get tired of seeing it again and again.No film ever has touched me more than this (even force me to cry!) Of course acting and music help to improve it's efficiency.This awesome movie is about an innocent man who represents how the world should be: he's loyal, humble, honest, he would never cheat or lie. He does everything with good heart and reaches success at the most important tasks of life."
506994,False,"One of the best movies i ever seen! You invest a lot of time in your blog, making sure it fits your personal brand and style.

506995,False,"I am a big fan of Tom Hanks and I have enjoyed pretty much all of his movies and I think forest gump is my favorite Hanks film of all time.It's such a nice story that is told in a clever way making you feel like a child once again, the main character played by Hanks is lovable, you can't help but hope for the best for him and simply just want to reach out and tell him everything will be OK. The movie has a realistic feel even thought it's fictional but this is because of how it goes though real time events, the main reasons why I love this movie so much is because it's like reading a book the story line takes you to another time and other place and the only bad thing is when it ends and you bounce back to reality."
506996,False,"An excellent film about love,hope and strength-both physical and mental.Forrest Gump is a magical character and his innocence is moving mountains.He has the ability to change everyone's lives.The film shows that everything is possible and that love is all you need in order to make the difference.So simple!But though Forrest is simple,he is also complex.His honesty and kindness lack from other movie characters.The film balances between comedy and drama but truth remains till the end.It is also deeply sentimental but on the same time,exposes Forrest's character.You'll be amazed by it's simplicity and the message of the film is that words like love,hope and trust have still meaning and value!"
506997,False,"It's great to be born a Forrest Gump or copy him as a life-long example. If achieved, then you won't have a thing for new tighter living conditions, would not kill yourself over trivial stuff, let go of the past before moving on, and take the best out of yourself in every situation. It's easier to decide and it's simpler to seize the moments. You'll do everything solely from the bottom your heart and walk, talk, and live merely for the sake of things.Forrest Gump turned out to be a war hero, a successful businessman, a great athlete, and an inspirational figure with a below 80 intelligence quotient (IQ). That is what almost everyone possesses, but wouldn't put the right amount of it in the right place so as, even though hundreds of people are looking up to you, to just stop running WHENEVER you don't feel like it and GO HOME!"
506998,False,"Once upon a time...This is the feeling I get when I think about Forrest Gump. With a narrator the movie becomes magic. Seeing the world through Forrest Gumps eyes is truly a fairy tale. Overcoming difficulties as a child and growing strong from it. Seeing the world. Meeting famous people like presidents, rock stars and other celebrities. Starting a big company that take the world by storm.The actors are fantastic. Tom Hanks is brilliant as Forrest Gump. Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan Taylor is really hard-boiled. Sally Field and Robin Wright are a delight. Remember whatever happens in your life just go out and run, just run and everything will feel better."
506999,False,"I really don't rate Tom Hanks as an actor, I think he's highly inconsistent, and often his acting style is off-putting to me. Now put Tom Hanks doing a stupid voice, playing a ridiculous character, taking up all the screen time, in a really long film. It's like torture. I was willing this film towards the end. I didn't feel any genuine drama, the Vietnam scenes especially leaving me cold. What I liked was the Zemeckis stylistic touches. It's got a nice whimsical feel, and just enough lighthearted humour to keep it afloat. For this film to work on any real level though, you would have to connect with the central character, which I just can't do. It's a very average story really focusing on one character who has very little personality. In terms of film making, it's just OK.Six out of Ten."
507000,False,"This is a very endearing story, very well written and performed. This is a movie you can definitely watch more than once. You get to follow Forrest through his life, ups and downs. You really get to bond with this character and his loved ones, and even though it may appear a bit too much, you won't care. This movie does live up to its standard, and I went in with very high expectations. You will laugh, you may shed a few tears - and you will definitely root for Forrest. It's a beautiful movie, and I think it sends out a message. You learn to appreciate your life and what you have been given. Fantastic storytelling, fantastic actors and so on. It will be worth your time."
507001,False,"Over the years, as peoples' memory fades, you'll see some critic somewhere say crazy things like Tom Hanks didn't deserve the Oscar for this. Usually it's a critic talking about the greatness of Shawshank Redemption or Pulp Fiction. Hey, it was a tough year at the Oscars! But Tom deserved it. Forrest Gump was simply amazing. There were a couple of the cut in scenes with Forrest and whichever person from real footage that didn't make 100% sense dialogue wise, like his interaction with Gerald Ford or John Lennon, but the movie is fun, funny, and heartwarming. When Forrest asks about his son, ""Is he smart, or is he like me?"" It'll bring tears to your eyes. Well, it does to me anyway! www.griswolddad.com"
507002,False,"ho did he ever manage to enlist in the Army? okay, okay...we have some of the best movie making ever, in the first hour or so...then we veer off into 7 other movies.the character has an IQ of 75 but his intellect does not account for his, shall we say, humanitarian IQ. are we supposed to wonder...is he such a moral, courageous man because he does not deal at all in adult social complexities and just reacts? is he a ""savant"", in that as ""dumb"" as he is, intellectually, he can accomplish things that ""average"" people cannot, simply because they *think* too much? I wondered if his running ability is half ""transferred"" skill (what he lacks in real brainpower he gains in braunpower?).we are given not one porterhouse steak here but two...meaning, too much is too much. Like Fred Blassie once said, you see women wrestling two nites in a row, by the third?.....nah. should the Director/Writer simply presented the greatest human running machine in history > cannot possibly break a sweat, stopping his run only for food and nature calls? well, he is the world's greatest runner, a War Hero, a multi-million dollar entrepreneur...and he's got a hot hippie chick n the back burner, too! I think the creators referenced MARATHON MAN, BEING THERE, that DUSTIN Hoffman movie where he plays the ""counting"" marvel.the two disc set does not include the deleted footage where Gump meets Jesus. :)"
507003,False,This has been one of the best movies I have ever seen. It's a powerful movie with great acting that you will remember for the rest of your life. No matter how many times I have sat down and watched it it keeps me entertained as if I've never seen it before. If your looking for a movie that will be a tear jerker and make you laugh and go through all the emotions at least once then this is the movie for you. With every new movie that comes out today I have still never watched anything that can even compare to this movie. This will forever be one of my all time movies and doubt anything will ever come close to beating this. So I would recommend checking this movie out and I can guarantee you will not be disappointed.
507004,False,"One of the most touching, educative, and beautiful movies of all time. A beautiful story about a boy that weren't the smartest in his class, but still made really far. It all begin when Forrest learned to run. After that he was running all the time. He even made it to the All-America football team. Forrest' best-friend Jenny was understandable for Forrest but she was traveling all the time.This movie is also full of historical references. For example Vietnam war, Dsegregation of Alabama university and the assassination of J.F Kennedy.I couldn't get my eyes off of this movie since it was so touching and full of funny and action-packed scenes. They were one of the best two hours of my life watching this movie, and everyone should definitely watch this."
507005,False,"Epic story of the life of a historical character who has gone through several historical facts and with his stupid way just taking letter in various situations. For me is the best film of all time with a fantastic performance of Tom Hanks. Forrest Gump, while not intelligent, has accidentally been present at many historic moments, but his true love, Jenny Curran, eludes him. Forrest Gump is a simple man with a low I.Q. but good intentions. He is running through childhood with his best and only friend Jenny. For me is won the Oscar's: Best Actor in a Leading Role Tom Hanks, Best Director Robert Zemeckis. Run Forrest, Run Forrest!!!"
507006,False,"When I hear people say that they've never watched Forrest Gump before, it makes me want to cry for them. They do not know what they are missing. It has history, drama, romance, and comedy put in one great movie. If you have not seen this movie, I strongly suggest you rent it, stream it, buy it, or whatever you must do to watch this movie. Just like Mean Girls, Forrest Gump will always be quoted, especially from me. I don't recall what I got for my first Christmas and I don't know when I went on my first outdoor picnic...but I do remember the first time I saw the greatest movie. That's all I have to say about that...GUMP!"
507007,False,"l its must see and meandering, this is among the stand-out audience pleasers; Hanks outdoes himself in the lovable dolt department with unforgettable, utterly disarming work. Just as he recaptured boyishness in Big without resorting to cuteness, here he brilliantly portrays slowness and dumb doggedness without being patronising. Despite its flaws, this is simply unmissable. Forrest Gump (Hanks) is short on I.Q. points but long on heart, a pure and simple soul who follows a straight path through the world, ever true to the homely advice of his mother (Field) - the source of guiding Gumpisms such as ""Stupid is as stupid does"" - and to his elusive lifelong love Jenny (Wright). He begins his serendipitous skirmishes with destiny in childhood by unconsciously giving ideas to the as-yet-unknown Elvis Presley, and goes on to become, unintentionally, a football star, war h"
507008,False,"I've never seen a series like this. A trilogy of movies created with such love and care and utter perfection of craft that you can't help but walk away and wonder how did Peter Jackson make this possible? I have always loved the original ""Star Wars"" and ""Indiana Jones"" series for their epic storytelling, and just for just fitting in as a great moment in cinema. This should be, will be, remembered with as much revered fondness for generations to come. They do not make films like these anymore.As a stand alone film, it picks up immediately where ""Two Towers"" ends, so brush up before seeing it. I've read the books, and the anticipation of seeing some of the more profound moments in this film made me kind of view it with a rushed sense of perspective. I wanted to make sure everything in this film was done ""right"". And when it happened, it was. I will need to see this again to enjoy everything on a more casual level."
507009,False,"Forrest Gump is one of those classic movies that pretty much everybody has seen, and can quote as well. Hanks portrays Forrest beautifully and following the story of his life is quite interesting. Even though he's mentally a little slow, Forrest is loyal, loving and honorable, all very valuable qualities in a person. His classic ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" quote is one heard many times over, that everyone has quoted a few times in their life. The fact that is now a collection of stores in the US, Bubba Gumps, based from this movie, shows just how big of a film it is. There is some great acting in the film, and one that everybody should watch at least once or twice."
507010,False,"love this film cry every single time. such an awesome film and deserves everything it got, its a must see for everyone from children to 65+. the story-line and actors are all just amazing and make the movie worth seeing over again and again. also it stands as a very good family film and funny as well as dramatic. the standards were set very high for me when i first watched it and i was definitely not disappointed or let down! if you are reading this review to maybe watch this film just go and do it you will not think it was a waste at all and i'm pretty sure you will cry at least once through the full 2hours. Perfect classic movie."
507011,False,"This movie was my mother's favourite one when she was pregnant. I think I was born with the idea that this movie was came to world with me. Tom Hanks became one of my favourite actors because of this film. I found it so gripping, moving, I absolutely loved the main character. In my opinion, this movie was the perfect representation of kindness, sweetness and all the good it may bring. The story is quite simple: it's the life of a ""simple"" man (in other words, with a low I.Q. level), who's running from one crazy adventure to another. With his ingenious look, we see him growing from childhood until the adult age, following his heart and doing everything for his mommy and the woman he loves. I think I can qualify this movie as a masterpiece from the nineties. It is a tragi-comic movie, that everyone should see."
507012,False,"Forest Gump will make you Laugh,Cry,Cringe and JUMP FOR JOY!. Its about a boy who is Half retard that grows up doing extraordinary things...All while we get to see some historical American events take place through his perspective. It really is Drama in the truest sense of the word.""Mama said life was like a box of chocolates...you just never know what ya gonna get! Ha!"" ""Lieutenant Dannnnnnn Ice Creammmmmmmm. HAHA!!""This Movie has some of the best quotes of any movie Ever! Not everyone loves Forest Gump..But It's definitely a movie you have to see at least once to make up your mind..and quote the movie for years and years to come!"
507013,False,"Forrest Gump is the kind of film that shouldn't work on any level. It's as manipulative as a film can ever be, pulling strings and begging the audience to cry, and the entire event is drowned in sticky-sweet syrup. And yet - incredibly - Forrest Gump truly works. It is not without flaw - in fact, it would be nearly impossible to count down all of its many problems - but this film succeeds in being an entertaining, whimsical, and - at times - quite beautiful portrayal of life, love, and 20th century America. And while one would be quick to point to director Robert Zemeckis in regards to the film's success, or perhaps Eric Roth's screenplay, or even Winston Groom's book upon which the film is based, I think the reason this film works, is because of Tom Hank's legendary performance as the title character.Forrest Gump is a slow-witted Alabama native. But indeed, he has extraordinary talent, and an intriguing life story to tell to whoever will sit next to him at the bus-stop. Despite being embraced by - seemingly - everyone, Forrest Gump actually fared less well than critics. It holds a 72% on Rotten Tomatoes, which is a good score, but not a great one. This is largely because Forrest Gump will not appeal to the cynical. And Lord knows that film critics get enough hate as it is, but there's simply no two ways about it: Film critics, generally speaking, are more cynical than the average movie-goer. Those willing to accept the occasionally preposterous nature of the film and the sometimes cloying sentimental tone will find a lot to enjoy. But if you've never quite cottoned to the sappier efforts of Steven Spielberg or renaissance Disney, you may find Forrest Gump to be an eternal 142 minutes.One of the problems with Forrest Gump is that the film goes to exceedingly great lengths to make Forrest as endearing and likable as possible. And honestly, it wasn't necessary; he's already a likable character. Additionally, Forrest Gump just seems to be an expert at everything. When we learn he's an incredibly fast runner, we buy that. But after we learn he's incredible at putting guns together, playing ping-pong, etc., things get a little stale.On top of that, Forrest Gump also has a running gag in which Forrest turns out to be the originator of several pop culture staples, from one of Elvis Presley's dance moves, to the creator of the ""smiley"" face, etc. Forrest Gump spends so much time winking at the audience, one begins to ponder the likelihood of contracting an eye-lid blister.In spite of the film's many problems, however, Forrest Gump is a good film, largely thanks to Tom Hanks. His performance adds an element of genuineness and sincerity to the picture, thus balancing the syrupy sap. On paper, the Forrest Gump character comes off as cloying, but when you see Tom Hanks portray this character, it not only works, it comes to life. This is not a case of a great performance making a decent film worth seeing. This is a great performance that elevates everything surrounding it. It gives the movie a classy nature that makes the sentiment feel earned.There are genuine moments of beauty and grace. In fact, some sequences are almost stunningly beautiful. When the film eases back a little on the sweetness, it has an old-fashioned appeal to it, and an unmistakable charm in the aesthetics of the picture.The visual effects are superb. Forrest Gump seamlessly blends with the archival footage in an effect that still holds up today. Even more impressive - to my eyes, anyway - is the effect used for a character who has lost his legs in the war, and must function without them.I've already praised Hanks' performance, but the rest of the cast is worth noting too. Robin Wright plays Forrest's love interest, Jenny, in a more serious role. She captures the depth of the character, and is never as annoying as she might have been in less capable hands. Gary Sinise as Dan Taylor delivers a performance that's absolutely marvelous, and even giving Hanks a bit of a run for his money. Sinise's performance is powerful and gripping. Sally Fields portrays the most charming of the cast, Forrest's mother, in a sweet but memorable supporting role. Michael Conner Humphreys and Hanna R. Hall portray young Forrest and young Jenny respectively in excellent child performances.Alan Silvestri's score is very pretty, but it receives an absurdly little amount of screen time. It gets two major appearances (other than the credits), and that is the very beginning, and the very end. You hardly hear it at all the rest of the film, which is largely populated with obnoxious, time-period- accurate, pop and rock songs. While they are interesting from a stylistic point of view, they are simply atrocious from a musical one. They end up stealing a lot of screen time that would have been better served by Silvestri's much more palatable musical score.Forrest Gump is heavily flawed, but it has some wonderful moments. Tom Hanks gives the performance of his life, and despite too much sweetness at times, the film is a real charmer. The acting is great, the screenplay is great, the score is great, and the characters are great. The over- sentimentality brings the film down a bit at times, but it's hard to imagine that too many people would leave Forrest Gump without feeling at least a little better about life."
507014,False,"I give it a 10 out of 10 because it is in my Top 100 Movies of all time (Top 10, actually), and because when I run across it on TV I can't help but watch whatever is left of it time-wise... I must have done that 25 or 50 times, and probably always will... I think that's what you do when you like a movie over most others...A bunch of years have now gone by since I saw ""Forrest Gump"" the first time - in a theater, and when I try to think of movies I'd prefer to re-watch I have a hard time coming up with 10, some days it's only 2 or 3... Then again I've been told I'm a sentimental old fool...The only reason I am here writing this considering 20 years have gone by since the debut is that I bumped into someone recently who hasn't seen this film, and I thought maybe something I might say could possibly persuade a similar person to go rent it...

507015,False,this film is one of my many favorites the plot can just move you its simple yet pure genius and its many lovably characters add to the great aspect of the film it teaches people about loving yourself and also about ant-bullying and the effect it has on a persons life i think forest gump is and inspirational film that will never be forgotten and family's in generations to come will love it just as much as i did. although forest gump is a well known film people still do not show as much appreciation for it that i think it should get its a great story taht can help kids in need thou its not based on a true story the film director and characters portray it as one they make it full with real emotion that you can feel when watching it.
507016,False,"It's a film that changed the history of the world, many of the things that happens every day I remind this film, the simplicity of its narrative captive, I have seen many times and will continue to do, is a film that does not let you get bored, you filled with a myriad of feelings, makes you change the world's perspective, I fascinate the special effects in this movie, see how passes and meet a president, then another, the humorous situations, like everything fits with the history of the world, the direction of this movie is very good, easily understood all, the interpretation of the situations, feelings, intentions, etc. think there is anyone who has not enjoyed this movie in this world, should be in the top 10 drama movies in the world."
507017,False,"I know 'Best Movie Ever' sounds like such a cliché, a phrase used to death. Many people use it on movies which really do not deserve to be called the best movie ever. I believe that the phrase ' Best Movie Ever' should be reserved for one movie only. This is really a legendary movie. It will always be one of the best.I can't believe how low the rating is. It deserves to be even higher up there. The plot and acting is magnificent. I've seen it at least three times and it's always good to see it again, because it's just that good. There is something that makes this really unique. It is really difficult to explain what that exactly is. It is the best ever. It will move you. You will love it. If you haven't seen it, watch it. 10/10"
507018,False,"Here, we have a story that is worth being told for generations to come.A story of a man, who had everything going against him and yet he did whatever best he could. And when you do your best in whatever you have taken upon, you would mostly succeed. And there in lies the story of FORREST GUMP. When you are determined, even Gods would come down embracing you. Look at that scene in which there were no shrimps and after the hurricane there is plethora of shrimps and they become millionaires.Yet, most of it is untrue and even hypothetical, like running coast to coast for 3 years. Even such fabrications will be loved and embraced, if we love this man called Forrest Gump. He does everything from meeting the president to running the whole of America to being a war hero and setting up his own business and becoming a millionaire. And did I say, this was against all the odds, he had, yes, he did not have legs and he got them back by running, he is mentally retarded, yet he proves all of them wrong by being successful in everything he does. Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump, has given us one of the best performances ever and this is a great character in itself. I have learnt from wikipedia that Robert Zemeckis the director, deviated from the novel written by Winston Groom. Now, what he did as a the director was a good thing and that is what I strongly believe. I did not read the novel though, but I loved Gump the way he is, so I think the changes were good. Technically, I liked the editing, though nearly 2 and half hours long, it was not at all so boring. Also, the screenplay by Eric Roth was good. The direction, I loved it. Look at that feather fly from skies to Gump's feet and then fly away at the end, just a glimpse of what direction is. Special effects were great specially in terms of putting Gump with the presidents and even John Lennon, I just liked the way it was all done. Also, I loved the dialogue and what a piece of writing this was, you can turn simple things interesting by saying them in an interesting way, and this movie does that through dialogue.Above all, I loved Forrest Gump as he is and more than anything, I loved Tom Hanks as Forrest, this is a great portrayal of a character. From dialect, to walking style to costumes, everything was appealing and interesting about Forrest Gump.It's a 4/5 for a movie that is great in terms of characterisation of a man who has has a ""JUST DO IT"" spirit and for Tom Hanks who has given one of the best performances."
507019,False,"this is one of the few movies that really inspired me when i was young, amazing sets, photography, special effects, and in general all the components that merged to grain to reality this master piece of Hollywood.a special mention to the FX in the movie, mind blowing, superlative, incredible, a really great job done.the performance by Tom Hanks is breath taking, he really deserved that Oscar,he's amazing.cheersJuan camilo"
507020,False,"Still very sweet, earnest and emotive after all this time, though it very nearly drowns in a perpetual stream of fibs and exaggerations. The constant pop culture references, and Forrest's appearances in just about every last hallmark moment of his generation, act as both a blessing and a curse. They represent a majority of the film's enduring identity, with a certain amount of charm attributed to the seamy, not-quite-there execution of the archival footage, but it's often a case of too much of a good thing. His silly contributions during the continent-spanning run that seals the second act are particularly egregious - good for a very quick snort, but ultimately damaging to the story at large. It's got a big, heavy heart though, and that carries it a long way. Tom Hanks, of course, is to thank for a great deal of that, but Gary Sinise is almost just as good in his cigar-chomping, world-loathing, hat-hanging support role as Lieutenant Dan. A one-of-a-kind classic that may have been just a smidge overrated at the time it was released, its cornerstone scenes still hold up very well and the classic cast of characters may as well be family at this point."
507021,False,"Many years from now, people will still be enjoying this movie of personal triumph -- relating the varied life experiences we all go thru. The movie: ""Forrest Gump"" - is brave enough to show us every side.I cannot every forget his simple wisdom: ""Momma always says, Stupid is as stupid does""!! And also... when asked, Why did you stop running? His simple reply, ""I was tired."" And seemingly having no perception of the lives he affected by doing that one small, heartfelt, gutsy task - to follow his bliss (for that moment). It would be great if we all could remain as innocent as Forrest Gump.Of course, kudos to the one and only Tom Hanks!! There's not a movie with his name that I won't watch; and I tired!! LOL Absolutely love him and his mastery."
507022,False,"I'm spoiling the end of the movie. I believe this was a made for TV movie. Had a boy in it, who was early twenties I believe. He was driving somewhere and his car fell off a cliff. His mom got a search party with police and they had a hard time finding him. I think he might have took a different route to wherever he was going. In the end his mom finds him and it was days later and she thought he was dead but he was just barely alive. I try to find an old animation movie that I watched as a kid on TV in the 90s (it could be older) and made an enduring impression on me. I remember the ending most vividly: a bloody battle on the top of a hill where two armies clashed, apparently led by a man and a woman inside cyborgs or some kind of robotic vehicle. These two seemed to share a history (fling?? / siblings??) and confronted each other beside a nearby river. They both died. The movie ended tragically with a shot of the great tree on the top of the hill, surrounded by corpses of both armies.. The only other thing I recall is a young man and a woman that spent the night in a house and in the morning the woman transformed in a butterfly and flew away. The man tried to catch her but without success. The butterflies (souls??) seemed central to the movie. It was all very depressing (as you can imagine :-P) but it was so powerful animation that stuck to my head for years! I tried to find it in IMDb, google and anime sites through keywords but to no avail. It seemed to be Japanese animation but I cannot be sure.. Sorry it's so vague I saw this on CBC years ago. Thanks!!"
507023,False,"I never give films a 10 as no film is a 10 in my eyes. However, this film is just a masterpiece. I think it's got that typical boy chasing girl routine which is expressed so emotionally and sensitively. I like the realism of this film, how it focuses on real life issues and how they're incorporated into Forrest's life. I think this film is brilliantly written, shot and presented so that the audience feels the true depth. I especially love how everything Forrest gets into is the simple ""in the moment"" attitude which says a lot about society which I especially enjoyed the most. A fantastic film, recommend to all. It can open your eyes to how you see your life as well as what is around you. :)"

Then i discover this that a cinema can inspire people that much i never even can imagine. After watching it, my vision over cinema had changed. What a cinema !!!A man named Forrest gump who is not normal like us and even in his childhood he was cripple. This cinema started like he is different from us. However, he is actually a normal fellow which actually impact on normal people. The things he feels to do, he gave his maximum focus on it. He is not much smarter than normal people but he knows what love is and in the end it really give us a theory on infant love.As a man like Forrest gump could do his duty which he actually destined to do. Why we people are so much hesitated and convoluted with our work when we are in disappointing situation. We should know the line ""Life is a box of chocolate, you never know what you are gonna get"""
507025,False,"One of best made movies of all times (in my eyes). Inspiring and cool as well as funny. The story is told in way that can make ""special"" people be smart and understanding. It also tell us not to ""judge book by it's cover"". We all live in era where perfection has to come with intelligentsia, talent and (in some cases) money. I myself have watched this movie about 20 times so far and still love to watch it with friends and family. Is good movie. I do own DVD of it and is next to my other collection. Money well spend. Can't wait till they remake it but hope that they do not destroy it story line or how it is done.. I gave it 9 out of 10 just because is z best ;)"
507026,False,"I get into an argument with a friend in New Orleans in 2011. He claims that Forrest Gump is the greatest movie of all time. I am bothered by this and ask him to state his case. He replied that they are parodies, restaurants, everyone quotes it (18 years later), 6 Oscars in a year where the academy saw outstanding movies (shawshank, pulp fiction, lion king!), and goes on and on and on. I argue back saying it only won 6 Oscars (compared to others that won more), that the academy just loves Tom Hanks and Robert Zemekis, and how they are better movies than Forrest Gump. We have to put the argument on hold due to the fact that we were walking to a wedding and had arrived. While sitting in the church at the ceremony, the priest's first words in his sermon are, and i kid you not, ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know which one you are gonna get"". At this point in time, I slowly look to my right, and my friend seating a few seats away, slowly returns a look at me with a cheesy smile and nods his head. I can say after that moment, Forrest Gump is the greatest movie of my generation, and possibly the greatest movie of all time."
507027,False,"We watch movies because of the stories, right? This is a masterpiece,one of the best movies I have ever watched. Many people would think its old and boring, Let me tell something I thought the same. One day maybe five years back, I was going through my movies and I found this, first I thought it would be a good movie but boring, then I started to watch just little bit of the movie than little bit more and more and MORE.. I didn't stop till the movie was over, the story telling in this movie is beyond your grandma use to tell you. YES! I'M SERIOUS. NO KIDDING. The acting, direction, characters, story, the chemistry and everything is just indefinable in words. And Tom Hanks live up-to his reputation of a legendary actor.

Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream. This movie is an amazing movie, with themes still relevant today although its outdated nature. well worth watching for people of all ages. I personally watched it with my family and siblings 4, 7 and 9 and they loved it. Tom hanks pulls off the Character of forest gump amazingly, and the new restaurant chains dedicated to the movie are also a great hit."
507029,False,"1994 was a pretty good year for film. Along with ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" we got ""Forrest Gump"", an idiosyncratic movie that became a global phenomenon. Popular with both critics and audiences, it accomplished the rare feat of winning the Best Picture Oscar while also ranking #1 at the box office for the year.The story revolves around the title character, a dim-witted Alabamian who unwittingly plays a part in some of the key events of the 20th century. From inspiring Elvis Presley's signature gyrations to meeting the president (twice), Gump pops up all over the place as either a participant or an observer. This tour through American history will hold special appeal for baby boomers but those from subsequent generations with a reasonable grounding in American history will also get a kick out of it. However, the movie isn't just a nostalgia trip. The central love story supplies a strong thread linking everything together, as does Gump's relationship with his mother and his two best friends.That being said, perhaps the main reason why the story comes off as well as it does is the actors. Tom Hanks, in the title role, is the movie's anchor. His performance is by turns funny and touching and it led to a well-deserved second consecutive Best Actor Oscar. The rest of the principle actors were scarcely less impressive. Sally Field as Forrest's mother, Robin Wright as his long-time love interest and Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan all gave awards-worthy performances. Also worthy of note is Mykelti Williamson, whose relatively small role as Bubba was nevertheless highly memorable.In terms of film-making craft, the movie shows exceptional polish. The direction by Robert Zemeckis is always well handled and the production values are excellent. The story's breadth provided ample opportunity for striking visuals and varied settings. ILM's Oscar-winning visual effects (which memorably inserted Hanks into archival footage, among other accomplishments) also deserves credit, though some of the effects are admittedly a little rough in comparison with future efforts. Throughout, Alan Silvestri's Oscar-nominated score provided a solid backdrop in tandem with countless shrewdly chosen period-specific pop songs.Ultimately, though, ""Forrest Gump"" is not without its detractors. Some claim that the movie is overly sentimental and that the title character is less than endearing. I don't agree with that at all. The movie's poignancy is well-earned and Gump himself is an iconic character vividly brought to life. In my opinion, ""Forrest Gump"" was a deserving Best Picture Oscar winner, even considering its tough competition."
507030,False,"Little do we ever ponder over the details of our lives. Such is the story of Forrest Gump, the story of life. If you look at it, it's just a story about a guy, living his life the way we all do. We often overlook at things happening around us, and we don't realize exactly what had happened with our lives.Forrest Gump, the idiot, tells the story of his eventful life. With his below average IQ, and low wit, he had been present in numerous occasions of historical importance, he reveals his life story, and how he had been in each and every one of the events, and how he tried to pursue the love of his life, Jenny.Tom Hanks at his finest, great performance by everyone in the cast, and overall made it one epic movie to watch. The movie had a grasping plot, a great character development, and from the start out, I couldn't stop watching it. This movie definitely goes into my ""Greatest Movies""!"
507031,False,"Love how this movie takes all the important events. The actors did a wonderful job. There was a good relationship between them to pull off some of the comedy, drama, happy and sad situations. I love the final outcome. Some may think this moves in different directions, too slow or fast but this was informative to those who are young and don't know or haven't lived it, those who are old enough to know, may have forgotten and lived it, those who are too young to comprehend or haven't been born yet but when the opportunity comes around will be introduced to it. I'm not going to give any moments away because I know how it feels to want to see something and people just can't wait to tell you everything."
507032,False,"In my opinion Forrest Gump is the best film I have ever seen. It is incredible how they have managed to fit a man's whole life into one film, that lasts just under two and a half hours, and not compromise on quality. They spend just enough time on every point in the film, so that you get enough detail but still don't get bored. The character may not be considered clever but he still manages a lot in his life. The film sees him achieve a lot from going to war in Vietnam, to being a professional Ping-Pong player. However, The main aspect that keeps popping up in every section is how great he is at running. Tom Hanks portrays the Forrest brilliantly and makes him a unique character unlike any other. The fact that he does not understand the world around him makes the film only funnier, especially in his narrated parts.""They said it was a million dollar wound, but the army must keep that money cause i still ain't seen a nickel of that million Dollars.""Another clever thing about the film is that Forrest always seems to be there when famous events happen, and you see them from his perspective (normally him not understanding what's going on.This film is great spanning across many different genres including romance, drama, action and always comedy."
507033,False,"Forrest Gump is the best movie ever made. When I first saw it I only sat through the first minute of it and turned it off. After growing with my age and watching a lot of other movies, Forrest Gump was the one that I couldn't take my eyes off of. Forrest Gump is the first movie since Titanic that has made me cry because of Tom Hanks and Gary Sinises outstanding performances. Almost never in my life have I been captivated by a movie and how it played out. Forrest Gump is neither too long or too short, for me it never dragged along and made me bored. Out of the six Oscars that Forrest Gump won, this movie rightfully deserved all of it. Pretty much everything made sense to me which made this movie really great for me. All in all I give Forrest Gump a 10 and think that this is a movie that should be watched for the rest of time."
507034,False,"'Forrest Gump' is a movie that tells the story of the life of a fictitious character called Forrest Gump, who would probably be diagnosed with a mental disorder nowadays. In Gump's life, he must overcome many obstacles, which he does in a way we might call a wonder. The movie is a literary adaptation of the eponymous book by author Winston Groom. In our opinion, the movie is a must for everybody interested in films. It convinces with its great story, its humor and the love with which it was made. Historical events are indicated and changed in an amusing way. For the most part, the look is kept simple, but in some scenes - like the one with former US-president John F. Kennedy - the video editing exceeded everything imaginable at this time (1994). Other points why the film is close to perfect are the music, the message and, last but not least, the incredible performance of main actor Tom Hanks. The movie won six Academy Awards and was nominated for another seven. In addition, it won three Golden Globe Awards and was nominated for four more. We think the awards speak for themselves and if you don't believe us, watch it!Andreas S. and Jakob W."
507035,False,"For me this movie is just Tom Hanks. The story is there and it is fine, but everything depended on the 1st role actor. I hear often that is is easy for an actor to play an imbecil but I sure doubt that anyone could play it as well as Hanks. At first I did not find the character believable. It seemed to have Hanks in the wrong flick. After like 15minutes of dubbing I found myself totally submerged in the story. A young, stupid boy who somehow managed to live his life with honor and without hurting anyone else. Everything thanks to his mother who loved him so much. This movie sneaks up on us like we never seen it and a simple little chain of events becomes a huge story of a man and life and what it is all about. Serious, funny and dramatic at the same time."
507036,False,"""Life's a box of chocolates"" - This is truly one of the best ever produced films in the Amercian history. Extremely insightful and educational, one can rely on great enjoyment and entertainment whilst watching this film. A true mix of emotions takes the audience on a real journey, not only in Gump's life, but also the American suffering and battle to see through all that came in its way. A fantastic recreation of time, and brilliant performances allow this to be an equally educational film to all those studying the Vietnam War. The performances create deep, emotional and defining characters, which any viewer can relate to...An unforgettable film with an amazing story, great acting and an exceptional production: from Directing to production design - its theatrical release success proves its splendid quality!"
507037,False,"Forrest Gump is one of those movies I'm shocked to hear when someone says that they have never seen--or God forbid, never heard of. A cultural milestone not only for the '90s, America, or modern classics of film, but for just about any and every country that's able to access films and cable. I think I'd be lying if I didn't mention that I bawled buckets in just about every other scene of the movie--I did see this movie for the first time when I was about 11, but I'd probably cry buckets nowadays too.Forrest Gump features great direction--Back to the Future, anyone? And phenomenal acting from Tom Hanks. Perhaps my memory is not too fresh, but I remember thinking that he didn't win the Oscar for this film and getting really mad, until I found out that he had indeed won the Oscar for this film. Wow, okay, I'm not sure why that last statement was relevant, but to be honest, none of this is relevant so if you're still reading this crap, it's your own fault.Anyway, back to the lousy movie criticism over a movie I'm sure you'd have to be an irrational loser to dislike. Music? Wow, cry me a river. Writing? Yeah, pretty incredible for an adaptation. Umm.. Editing? Great. I shouldn't be writing a review with the mindset I currently have. Perhaps I should never write reviews, but I do because I like to, just like most people on this site.Again with the red herring fallacy! All right, so Forrest Gump is an amazing movie. It's beautiful in its elegance. The story-telling factor is really cool--then again, when was the last time voice-over was considered original? 1944? Voice-over's not always a bad choice. I think Forrest Gump would be one of the better examples of the practise.The film is particularly skilled at provoking emotion, as well. Who could possibly dislike Forrest? If the smart were to dislike Forrest for being less-than-intelligent, wouldn't it be a bit like skinny people hating fat people and getting insulted for thinking that way as a result? Or when a white person hates a black person? But of course, if it were the other way around it would be regarded as rational thinking? Haha! Ain't it a nice world we live in? I'm certain that I ruined this review with the amount of topic-changing I did, but it took a while to write, so I'm still publishing.I sincerely apologise if you read this god-awful review. It's really no excuse for such a wonderful film. I would recommend it to just about anyone, though. Even to my enemies, because I think this is a film no one should die without seeing. It's the perfect '90s film too, made with great classic cinema elements that don't really appeal to modern day cinema fans nowadays. I'd guess 2002 was the cut-off for films like this, but I'm probably wrong."
507038,False,"Do we have a predetermined destiny or is it all just a coincidence? Forrest Gump, played by Tom Hanks, is not quite sure but, he is going to take us on a journey throughout his life and try to figure it out. Mama or Mrs. Gump, (Sally Fields) serves as his moral compass and tries to direct her son through life's lessons. She encourages her son to be himself and he is not different than anyone else, even if he has a low IQ of 75. His school age love, Jenny (Robin Wright), whom he will always love, takes on a role to protect him and his innocence. She even tries to protect him from her life choices.Hank's outstanding and convincing performance takes us through life and American history through the eyes of incorruptibility and taking each interaction at face value without the cynical perspective of the outside world. When faced with life's diversity, Gump equivocally responds with one of Mrs. Gump's famous life lessons such as, ""Stupid is, as stupid does!"" Forrest achieves a lot in his life like, becoming an All- American football player, being awarded the Medal of Honor, and last but not least becoming a millionaire. He even meets three different Presidents. Unintentionally proving that he is capable of more than what the outside world had imagined and became more successful in the process. As with anything in life, his great fortune is also accompanied with loss. He struggles to understand why it has to be a part of life.Alan Silvestri's magical composition carries us through the emotional ups and downs of love, loss, and life while smoothly transitioning us through time. Each piece of the soundtrack corresponds appropriately to the time period, convincing us even more that that is where we are.In ""The Notebook"" we are taken on a similar journey through love and life lessons that spans over a period of history. Throughout the film you are left to wonder if the two main characters have a predetermined destiny to be together, much like Gump and Jenny. Robert Zemeckis brilliantly utilizes the floating feather at the beginning and end of the film as a metaphor for human life. Gump decides at the end ""I don't know if we each have a destiny or if we are just floatin around accidental like on a breezemaybe it's both happening at the same time.""If you have not watched Forrest Gump, I highly recommend it. You will not be disappointed!"
507039,False,"Best movie ever, i can see it over and over again, if you don't seen yet you need to see it! Is one of those movies that are very very deep and awaken all kinds of feelings . It has moments of comedy and drama moments , share the depth and maturity with the ease and innocence, exudes optimism and pessimism , but above anything tenderness overflows during each instant during each sequence. The story is extremely emotional and chronicles the adventures over a lifetime, a big kid , a person who never lost his innocence , who fought to achieve their dreams, they always tried to take the right path and that many branded as having few lights, when the opposite is true . The interpretation of Tom Hanks is simply masterful!"
507040,False,This was a wonderfully sweet and thought provoking film. A must see.Tom Hanks really became the character. Events in the movie spoke to all regardless of your age. The storyline was very believable and kept you wanting to see what came next. I enjoyed the fact that the subject matter was dealt with in a respectful manner.All throughout the movie you could not help but want the hero to win and felt a strong attachment to him. Sally Fields character spoke to all women of the time.All in all I really enjoyed the film and would watch it again. It has staying power and is a keeper.
