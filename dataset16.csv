23209,True,"I'd like to keep my review rather to the point.Pros: 1. its theme - dream is a fascinating topic to say the least. There are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld. 2. its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns. 3. its edgy drive - although you know what's coming next, still you feel jumpy about it when it does.4. its rapid storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to another, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride. At times, it's hard to keep up, even after watching it several times. 5. its sophistication - there is a lot of information to remember and digest. This is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after, I believe. 6. its realism - okay, pun intended. The movie explains (or at least tries to) the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions, some of which are very familiar with and dear to us.Cons: 1. its poor character development - although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development. I wonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s) after watching the movie. Yes, the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else, if you ask me. 2. too many distractions - I found that the movie had more characters than necessary. They may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of distractions than anything else. I wish the movie was more focused. 3. a bit preachy - I noticed that the characters would explain things about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie. I'm afraid, Inception overused this trick. In conclusion, its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvement. I highly recommend you to go and read Somewhere carnal over 40 winks, if you dig this kind of flicks. Cheers!"
23210,True,"I cannot ignore facts. I cannot ignore mistakes and plot holes, bad writing, or bad marketing. I cannot ignore hype, especially when it's already on the IMDb top 250, it received praise from critics, cashed in a lot of money, and people call it stunning and unforgettable. The simple truth is that Inception does not live up to the hype. Let me start with the trailer. All the coolest things (the folding city, the collapsing cliffs, the train in the street) are totally unessential to the plot. None of that takes more than a few seconds. So why did they put them on all the posters as well? Nevermind. I'll move on to the real problems of the movie.So I heard all these people saying how complex the movie is. How I'll need to watch it twice. How the shocking ending will blow my mind. I knew exactly what that ""shocking ending"" would be half way through the film. The very last paragraph of this review deals with the ending. It's not exactly a spoiler but you can skip it if you don't want to know anything.Cobb (DiCaprio) takes on a mission to implant a thought into Fischer's (Murphy) mind. As a reward, his contractor Saito (Watanabe) will clean his record with the LAPD. Cobb is wanted for the murder of his wife and consequently he can't return to USA and see his children. Throughout the movie, this is Cobb's main inner conflict, that before he fled the country, he didn't get a chance to see the kids' faces and he wants to see them again. Michael Cain has a very small role as their grandpa and DiCaprio's father-in-law. Why doesn't Cain take the kids someplace so they could be with their father? People move all the time. Or why doesn't he send Cobb some home movies if he wants to see their faces so much? They could even have video calls and all that stuff. It's a long distance relationship but it's something. Well, apparently no one thought of that, and so the main character's main motivation for his actions makes no sense. As for acting, DiCaprio was good. But if you've seen Shutter Island, You've seen a third of Inception. Dead wife, small kids, a sense of loss, a pretty wooden house in a field, all those flashbacks Teddy had in Shutter Island it's all in Inception. Minus the funny Boston accent.The mission these mind thieves embark on is to plant an idea into a rich guy's mind. This is called inception. Hence the title, I guess. Everyone says it's impossible to do, so you know they are going to succeed in the end. Inception is essentially a heist movie, but instead of getting into a vault, Cobb's team has to get inside someone's mind  which happens to look like a vault. The supposed complexity of the movie boils down to the idea of a dream within a dream. Basically, imagine that once you are plugged inside the matrix, you plug yourself into yet another, deeper, matrix. There, I just explained the super complex plot of the movie. But in case that wasn't enough, there is Ellen page's character, Ariadne. She is the obligatory new member of the team that is introduced to represent the audience and their questions. I'm fine with that. Every movie has one of those uninitiated people. The thing is, she understands everything too quickly and becomes suddenly becomes the most competent character. Pretty convenient, if you ask me.Let me finally get to the mission. It's the worst part of the movie. Watanabe wants Murphy, who just inherited a huge corporation, to dissolve it, because it was going to become a huge monopoly. So Watanabe hires DiCaprio to plant the idea of splitting the company in Murphy's mind. And so they do that. For two and a half hours. But I don't care if he splits the big company or not. Why should I care if Murphy has a bigger company than Watanabe? The stakes of the movie aren't high, they are nonexistent. I am not given any reason to care about whether or not they succeed. I'm only given more and more action set pieces to look forward to, and a lot of cool slow motion and zero gravity fights reminiscent of The Matrix, but I'm not given any reason to care for what is happening. I liked Watanabe's character only because I like Ken Watanbe. As for Saito himself, I don't give a damn if his competitor destroys his company or not. They don't tell us what consequences it would have, they don't show us what happens with the company, they don't do anything with this initial idea. Which is strange, because the movie is all about ideas being important. Okay, so I didn't like the plot and the acting was nothing new. What about the rest? Hans Zimmer's unremarkable score works well with the scenes but it would be super boring to hear on its own. The visual effects are good but since all the coolest city-folding scenes were so short, there wasn't really that much to do. The zero gravity stuff was done well, I'll give them that. Cinematography was good, bordering on too much shaky camera.Here's the paragraph about the ending:The big ending is that you are supposed to be unsure what was a dream and what was reality. If it was real, then it's stupid because DiCaprio had dozens of ways to be with his kids without making things so incredibly complicated. The movie is supposed to make you think, but if you think about it the whole plot falls apart. If it was a dream, then it's a stupid cop out on Nolan's part. An excuse for all the things that didn't make sense. It was all a dream, so screw you, audience."
23211,True,"The central idea of ""Inception"" is an interesting one: technology exists to enter other people's dreams in order to steal their most private secrets or to implant new ideas. With Christopher Nolan of ""Memento"" fame as writer and director, this should have been a smart, compelling movie. Unfortunately, ""Inception"" is a bloated failure.The root problem is that Nolan replaces the fascinating surrealism of dream worlds with lengthy outtakes from James Bond movies. For example, early in the film, when Cobb and Ariadne are sitting at a café in a dream world, Cobb tells Ariadne to stay calm. What's going to happen? Is the waiter going to bring her a glass full of wriggling eyeballs? Is she going to turn around and see her best friend from high school having sex with Abraham Lincoln? No. THINGS START EXPLODING. And that's the whole movie in a nutshell: gaudy special effects and endless fight scenes as a poor substitute for imaginative ideas.The matryoshka-doll plot of dreams within dreams isn't nearly as hard to follow as one might imagine. This is largely because nothing of consequence happens at higher levels once our heroes have moved on to deeper levels. The higher-level supporting actors just fight off bad guys -- and overblown special effects -- until it's time to bring back their colleagues from the depths.Nolan should sit back, watch a few of the best movies by Luis Bunuel and David Lynch, and try again with one-tenth the budget and ten times the imagination. (Okay, that's never gonna happen, but it's *my* dream.)"
23212,True,"Just to start off, I read about 20 pages of reviews of this movie and had a few things of my own to add. I actually had to register to IMDb so I can explain why this movie is so bad. Seeing that this piece of garbage is rated 9 out of 10 made me wanna vomit. But enough about that, let's get to the serious issues with this movie. 1: Leonardo DiCaprio has not changed his role for the last 5 years. Am I the only one that notices this? He always plays some guy that has deep seated emotional issues relating to the loss of a loved one. Can he play anything else besides the loner that lost the love of his life and now has psychological scars that go so deep they hit the street he's standing on? 2: Why didn't they shoot his stupid wife anytime she showed up? He wasn't the only guy on the team that knew she was out to mess things up. Why not say, ""Hey guys, if you see my wife shoot her because she's going to get us all killed. She's not real and is already dead, so go ahead and blow her away so we can get back to work.""? 3: The dream world was the dullest I have ever seen. ""Oh man...M.C. Escher stairs, a train driving down the street, buildings that go sideways and upside down..."" That's all they could come up with? ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" was more imaginative than the supposed ""dream-world"". I'm pretty sure most dreams have more random stuff than that happen in them. Where's the off-the-wall imagination? I don't think anyone that says they had ""the weirdest dream"" explains it as, ""Well the world was the same, but a train showed up."" ""And?"" ""That's it. Everything else was completely normal."" Weak. 4: If I wanted to watch ""Call of Duty,"" I'd play the game. All of the shoot-out scenes looked like they were taken from ""Game Informer"" magazine screen shots. 5: How come when they went to Limbo, it was in DiCaprio's mind? Can anyone explain that? Is there just one Limbo that in all this movie world's history of dream exploration, but only he and his stupid wife got to and did stuff in? Or was his team (two of whom knew how messed up in the head he was) too dumb to say, ""Why don't we keep you out of this and go into someone else's head just in case this turns out badly?"". 6: As far as 9 out of 10, (really folks?) go watch ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" or even ""The Dark Crystal"" if you want a good movie that can stand-up to even the most mediocre critical observation."
23213,True,"Christopher Nolan has done some great work.His ideas and direction singlehandedly gave new life to the beloved superhero Batman.While the film Dark Knight will always be recognized to the new dimensions it added to the classic Batman series of movies and comics, Inception was nothing more than a dull and linear plot, surrounded by and an even duller and more linear plot.The centerpiece of this movie was supposed to be its convoluted storyline which was scattered across multiple levels, in essence puzzle that forces the viewer to think through the movie and decipher the ending.The concept of ""levels"" and or ""interconnected plots"" worked very well for such great films such as the Matrix, 2001 A Space Odyssey, Logan's Run, or Total Recall. Inception not only miserably fails at this but it also lacks in other places as well.-Characters: Great actors, whom have all done great work in many movies spanning decades. However the characters in this movie came off as neutered eunuchs who lacked sense, emotion, and any sort of cohesiveness. (Sir Michael Caine and Tom Berenger's performances were appalling and the ""team"" of dreamers lacked screen dynamics and chemistry.) -Action: For a dream world, the action in this movie is very unimaginative and is well within the typical Hollywood bounds. Car cash scenes where the heroes drive and shoot, building shootouts, and melodramatic bullet wounds (as always one character is wounded critically, the team must save him; however the character can still ""fight"".) -Plot: This movie could have easily been over within 1 hour of rolling. Not only was Inception's ""puzzle ending"" blatantly obvious 40 mins into the film, but the storyline it self lacked any substance or draw. The overly complicated ""puzzle piece"" effect which Nolan was trying to achieve, was nothing more than the main story line being surrounded by excessive fluff and whimsical bullplop.*I will credit the movie with one notable mention. Nolan managed to work a Matrix style fight scene (which have been overdone by Hollywood since the early 2000s) into the small confines of an elevator.In the ending, Inception is not the great rave that many make it out to be. While the movie takes place in a ""dream world"", where bounds are limitless, the movie itself is sterile, cliché, repetitive, and unimaginative. This is even further compounded by one dimensional characters, and a drawn out storyline that pretends to be an enigma.Perhaps Christopher Nolan's true intent was to make a sterile and lack luster movie aimed strictly at making today's self-absorbed and obtuse Facebook-hipster generation feel ""smart"".Inception can be compared to a class presentation where the student is unprepared. To hide this, the student uses convoluted and circular logic to stammer through the presentation and pass the time. It is obvious that the student knows nothing and has wasted several minutes talking about a subject that could have been explained in seconds. Nonetheless, since the student used ""big words"", talked excessively, and is deemed to be in the ""mainstream"" the class gives a standing ovation regardless..."
23214,True,"What do David Lynch, Luis Bunuel and Wes Craven have in common? They have all created far superior films about dreams on a fraction of Christopher Nolan's budget. For a film about dreams everything looks so dull and drained of color. Inception never feels surreal like a dream. It feels like ridiculous PG-13 action sequences strung together by character's explaining it's all a dream within a dream etc. When watching this film, I thought of far superior films about dreams and alternate realities, Bunuel and Dali's ""Un Chien Andalou"" (1929), ""The Blood of a Poet"" (1930), ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939), Hitchcock's ""Spellbound"" (1946), ""Meshes of the Afternoon"" (1947), Dr. Sues' ""5,000 Fingers of Dr. T"" (1953), ""Le Jetee"" (1962), Fellini's ""8 1/2"" (1963), ""Kingdom of Crooked Mirrors"" (1963) Fellini's, ""Juliet of the Spirits"" (1966), ""Who Wants to Kill Jesse"" (1966), ""Valerie and her Week of Wonders"" (1970), ""Viva La Muerte"" (1970), ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"" (1972), Tarkovsky's ""Solaris"" (1972), ""The Hourglass Sanitorium"" (1973), ""Eraserhead"" (1977) ""Altered States"" (1980), ""Time Bandits"" (1981), Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" (1982), ""Forbidden Zone"" (1982) ""Videodrome"" (1983), ""A Nightmare on Elmstreet"" (1984), ""Dreamscape""(1984), ""Brazil"" (1985), ""Paperhouse"" (1988), The B-movie ""Beyond Dreams Door"" (1989), ""Santa Sangre"" (1989), ""Jacob's Ladder"" (1990), ""Kurosawa's Dreams"" (1990) ""Total Recall"" (1990), ""Naked Lunch"" (1991), ""Arizona Dream"" (1993), John Carpenter's ""In the Mouth of Madness"" (1995), ""12 Monkeys"" (1995),""City of Lost Children"" (1995), ""Lost Highway"" (1997), ""Dark City"" (1998), ""The Matrix"" (1999), ""eXistenZ"" (1999), ""Being John Malkovich"" (1999), ""The Cell"" (2000), ""Waking Life"" (2001), ""Donnie Darko"" (2001), ""Muholland Drive"" (2001), ""Demon Lover"" (2002), ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (2004), ""Strange Circus"" (2005), ""The Fall"" (2006), ""The Science of Sleep"" (2006), ""Pan's Labrynth"" (2006), ""Paprika"" (2006) and the list goes on and on and on. 100's of French and Asian films; hell, even the ""Nightmare on Elmstreet"" sequels.In ""Inception"" Leonardo Dicaprio plays Dom Cobb, a dream thief who can enter people's dreams and steal top secret information. Like his character in ""Shutter Island"" (which had better dream sequences) Leo is obsessed with his dead wife and longs to go home to see his kids. He's given a mission by a corporate boss to enter a rival's dream and implant false information. By completing this mission, he'll be able to go home to his kids. Dom hires an architect played by Ellen Page to create false dream worlds. Then there's his agents, who are one dimensional rip offs of characters from ""The Matrix"" (A far more entertaining film) For a film about dreams, you'd expect a little Fruedian sex or nudity. Oh no we don't want are dreams to go beyond a mass-marketed PG-13 rating. Or how about at least abstract surrealism or stream of consciousness dialog? Instead we have all the character's taking time out to explain everything to Hans Zimmer's overblown music. In the words of Ariadne ""Wait, Who's subconscious are we going through exactly?"". That's odd, a shootout on skis, ""James Bond"" style and Look I'm floating like in ""The Matrix"" (Lets not get to bizarre or fun) Maybe, I'm being critical, because I'm by no means a fan of Christopher Nolan. ""Momento"" and ""The Dark Night"" were good films, but should never be mentioned in the same breath as HItchcock or Kubrick. People really anger me comparing Inception to ""Blade Runner"", or ""2001, A Space Odyssey"". Even ""Avatar"" had more heart and soul than ""Inception"". In ""Avatar"", I actually cared about the characters and felt like I was in a different world. In this film how am I supposed to care for rich corporate suits who want to steal secrets. How about having an Exxon executive jumping in the dreams of a BP executive? If it's all a dream within a dream within a dream of one dimensional Hollywood characters, why should the audience care? And why take 150 mins. to tell a story, when it could of been done in less than 2 hrs.?On one note, the special effects were impressive and the film did have great acting. I think this film could of been good if it was more colorful and dreamlike and maybe 45 mins. shorter. ""Inception"" fell cold and flat of having a heart and soul. Why do films now look gray, poo brown or washed out in color? Movies used to be so much brighter. Compare this film to ""Suspiria"" (1977), ""What Dreams may Come"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"" and you'll see what I mean. Spending $200 million dollars on a film that could of fed a 3rd world country for 10 years, is more of a nightmare than a dream. All that money spent and it still looks visually boring, artless and dull. As a person who practically makes minimum wage and lives off Ramen noodles, I watch sci-fi and fantasy films for an escape. Why would I care about a rich corporate rival who has a bad relationship with his father? Boo-hoo! In the end I felt like I was viewing the unimaginative dreams of Wall Street brokers. This is a film made by a room fool of people, rather than an artist with a vision. A mass marketed product like fast food, masquerading itself as nutrition. For this film to be in IMDb's top 5 is a joke; this is mediocre at best. People are saying that this is better than ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Blue Velvet"" or Citizen Kane"". I must be dreaming, no I kicked myself and this is for real."
23215,True,"I will try not to repeat some of what others have so brilliantly written in some reviews. I just add this in order to contradict the hype that has allowed this movie to be ranked so high in IMDb. The same has been happening with other movies, and that is a shame for IMDb, which is becoming unreliable.I want to stress the fact that the only complexity in this movie is trying to figure out how you can invest so much money in a script that continuously makes a fool of the average critic intelligent viewer! The story is not complex. It is deliberately confusing in order to conceal its stupidity. Nothing that really matters is explained in the movie.And there's so many embarrassing clichés (the recruiting of the team, the episode in Mombassa, the assault of the ice fortress, many of the action sequences)... the average viewer must be disappointed!And the dreams - which serve as the scenario to most of the movie - are populated by the utmost lack of imagination.Finally, there's the score, louder and louder, building a suspense that is never there, for everything is a dream, and we do not quite catch what there is exactly that can go wrong...Well, all in all, the movie is an insult to the average intelligent viewer and, having been directed by Christopher Nolan, an ultimate disappointment."
23216,True,"A visual Tour De Force that gets lost in its own complex world, Inception stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Dom Cobb; a rogue 'extractor' who steals elements of dreams and sells them to the highest bidder, all in the name of corporate espionage. But things start to go drastically wrong when Cobb takes on a seemingly impossible job and his dead wife turns up to make trouble.Ingenious but convoluted, Inception may not be to everyone's taste  but it is undoubtedly a Chris Nolan picture; the same man who gave us Memento, The Prestige and of course, The Dark Knight. The problem is that for all the slick visuals and clever narrative structures, we end up with something cold, clinical and frustratingly diffuse.Why Inception falters, and I appreciate that I may be in the minority, is that for such a surreal and imaginative concept to work, it requires an equally surreal and imaginative mind, and Nolan is just too conservative and too technical for the content. It might have made a more interesting film had it been directed by P.T Anderson or, dare I say it, Terry Gilliam."
23217,True,"Unless you call this movie a masterpiece. Then you are.Damn 1,000 word limit. Gotta make this quick.Spoilers.The film is 2.5 hours long, yet feels like 5.2, and there are a few reasons for this. One of which is the fact that a preponderance of the first act is amateurish, conflict-free exposition, which does not bode well for repeat viewings.The ""learning about the dream world"" scene is atrocious. No conflict. Both Leo and Page's characters already knew what was being explained. The similar ""learning about the matrix"" scene in The Matrix did it right by having one character not know anything. Plus, there was conflict. Neo gets his ass kicked and fails to make the building jump. Much more entertaining.There's another problem with the whole section of bending the landscape where Leo explains the negative aspects of altering the dream world. The closest we get to seeing the dream world altered was Leo becoming Mr. Charlie, yet the most that happens then is a bunch of extras turn and look at Leo. That's it. The idea was not exploited. You literally have to go out of your way to miss that opportunity. Hell, that Mr. Charles scene is shorter than the scene that explains why altering the dream world is bad! Let's not forget this whole idea of one corporation one-upping another has absolutely no personal ramifications for anyone on screen or in the audience. It would have greatly amped up the internal conflict if Leo had to struggle with the notion that helping the guy who could help him would endanger someone else close to him, or us, or someone else. ANYTHING could have worked better than an energy contract that means less to me than my neighbor's bath mat. Come on. The totems were handled very poorly. All we need to know is their purpose. We don't need to know anything else, yet the film keeps piling on needless information.If this is a heist film, where is the threat of being caught? A van falls for an endless amount of time. Joseph Gordon-Levitt floats bodies down a hallway for half an hour, real-time. The guy from Bronson does his thing, whatever the hell that was. These are not complex tasks or events, but rather straight-forward in nature. Dragging them out for a solid chunk of the film is what creates the glacial pace and makes a long film seem even longer.Inception has no real villain. You can make a case for Cotillard, but she is an internal enemy. She never takes a ""physical"" presence and never threatens anyone except Leo. Everyone else is dealing with faceless assassins. That makes it feel distant from the rest of the action. It doesn't even have anything to do, emotionally, with Leo's goal of getting home to see his kids. None of this is tied together. Leo didn't even know what the hell was going on with Cillian and never even knew of the outcome until after the fact. He's separated from the physical manifestation of his goal for a majority of the film. I ended up not caring if the plan succeeded. If it was all somehow tied together, the audience would be able to experience that great emotional catharsis that everyone was talking about...but that didn't happen.In fact, Leo is so separated from the actual plot that you can literally put Levitt in his place and not even need the hero in the dream world at all! Hell, you can even put Page there, since all she does after designing the boring and lifeless dream worlds is hang out with the guys and tell Leo he's crazy. I really wish she had something else to do besides play the part of the fifth wheel.Leo's lack of involvement in the main action of the story creates a 'so what?' moment when the problem is solved for him, and I can think of absolutely no reason why the hero should not be the one to conquer the main conflict. Brody kills the shark in Jaws. He doesn't send Hooper and Quint out to do his dirty work while he stays behind to deal with his fear of water. It's integrated. The hero is forced into dealing with the physical, and in turn, but learn to conquer his internal fears before he can conquer his external opponent. This is Screen writing 101, Lesson 1, and Nolan got that wrong. That's why I don't believe the reports that he spent 10 years writing the script since it only took me 148 minutes to figure out exactly what was wrong with it.Not to mention the conceit that to enter someone else's dream and control it means that you would have to control your own subconscious, which they state elsewhere is impossible. Way to go, genius.Pretty much everything this film does wrong, The Matrix does right. Watch that instead.PS: The 'taking a scene from the middle and putting it at the beginning' gag reached its peak effectiveness in 2002 and has absolutely no place in modern films. It's getting as bad as that tired old 'It's all a dream' scenario. Oh, wait..."
23218,True,"Well, first of all, I have to absolutely clearly admit that I'm writing this review to lower the rating of this movie, since it was one of the biggest movie disappointments of my life. Currently 9.1 for this thing is unbelievably high. But I guess I get why the rating of this movie is so high. It makes the people feel good about themselves because they understood the ""complicated"" plot. Yes, thats it! Inception actually managed to plant the idea to the people that it was a good movie. At best its an average action movie with too long boring action scenes with the ""added value"" of a ""smart"" story. However the story is not smart at all. Its about people that somehow are able to get into people's dreams and do stuff there, or even go to dreams in dreams, and dreams in dreams in dreams, and limbo... Wow, you get it? You are really smart, and should rate this movie 10!!! But seriously, this story is really stupid. Why should I care that the Japanese guy wants to destroy the other guy's (the scarecrow from Batman) company? How did the architect girl become expert on dreams and psychology after two dream sessions? How are they even able to get into the dreams? I guess the acting overall is not bad, but who cares if the plot is so annoying. And finally, the twist at the end is really predictable. Yay, the spinning thing stops to spin: he might be dreaming! Really original. You might say that I did not get the message of the movie. Well, I did get it, but it was too stupid to care about it."
23219,True,"What is going on with the IMDb user reviews lately? It's like the masses can no longer be trusted. In the last month, the users have decreed ""Airbender"" the worst abomination ever, when in fact it's just an average movie. User reviews raved over ""Despicable Me"", when it was about as entertaining as a ""Dexter's Lab"" rerun. And now? ""Inception"" is the 3rd best movie ever made? Are you kidding me? This was a very creative and interesting flick that went waaaayyy overboard. The problem with this genre (you know the genre -- was it a dream? or a dream about a dream? or a parallel universe where people dream they're dreaming about parallel universes while pretending to dream) is sooner or later you stop caring about the actual action because it's a dream. So the 20 minutes spent watching gunfights and car crashes in the pouring rain, and the 30 minutes spent watching these guys shoot up a ski fortress, and another 30 minutes watching what's-his-name float around a hotel just didn't do it for me. Not a terrible movie, but 3rd greatest movie ever? You must be dreaming."
23220,True,"Seriously? Mesmerizing? Fantastic? Genius? No.I was pretty excited about this film after all the hype, and I feel massively let down. The plot was overly drawn out and repetitive, and there was an over-reliance on action, with massive portions of the plot being taken up by filler scenes of silly shoot-outs and car chases.Christopher Nolan has given this film a superficial sheen of meaningfulness, with the admittedly astounding visuals covering for a plot so full of holes it's almost falling apart. Why are Dom and Mal shown as having grown old and grey together in limbo when they are also shown laying their head on train lines to escape limbo as 30-somethings? Why does the incessant music come to dominate the film, making every scene feel climactic, which is actually detrimental to the final climax? In a similar manner to the way in which the Wachowski brothers took the brilliant writings of Baudrillard and completely mangled them beyond all meaning in The Matrix, Nolan has taken a great idea and turned it into a teenage boy's shoot-em-up action fantasy. People might watch it and think ""Wow, that's really deep"". No, it's not. It has the appearance of being deep and meaningful when in fact it's just a shallow action film.I'm sure people will read this review and think ""she just doesn't get it"". The problem is that I do it get. Unfortunately there's just not a lot to get."
23221,True,"Alright, so here's the thing; yes, it was cool that there was all that complexity. Yes, it was cool that there were so many layers of thought both on screen and off to what was going on. Yes, it was cool that Chris Nolan managed to make something unique and fairly independent in just one movie that was complex enough to account for a whole trilogy of movies in almost any other genre. But here's the thing; it had some rather alarming logical leaps that I could not get over.1.The Projections; Okay, so the things that inhabit the streets of the person's subconscious are manifestations of the various components of their brain as evidenced by the fact that when the characters need to find something out about the dreamer's perception of someone else they just follow that manifestation in the dream. Makes sense, because that thought does what the dreamer thinks it would do, not what the real person would do. When I saw that I went 'wow, that makes sense! Clever!', but then towards the end of the movie they say 'nevermind, they're just projections; they don't actually mean anything, and parts of their minds aren't being killed.' That was a little too convenient for my liking.2.The Totems; WHY doesn't the top fall over in the dream world? WHY does it keep spinning perpetually? Everything else obeys the laws of basic physics, so why wouldn't that? That was probably the dumbest thing I've seen in a movie this year; there wasn't even an attempt made to explain it. I can honestly say this was just as bad as 'only a prime can kill a prime' in Trasformers 2.3. The Architect/Dreamer Relationship; Why can only the architect choose the world they enter? And why is the only person who 'projects' characters into this world the person that's 'the dreamer'? They are ALL dreaming, every single one of them, so they should ALL be both altering the world they're in and the characters in it. And why can't the projections do anything cooler than be normal guys with guns? If I detected intruders in my mind I'd summon a nuke or Godzilla or Optimus Prime to get them out, not boring henchman who probably wouldn't be able to get the job done anyways.4. The Script, and it's supposed 'surprises' I felt kind of talked down to when they honestly expected it to be a surprise when you discovered that Molly's death was as a result of Cobb's previous inception. If ANYONE made it through that movie without figuring that out they deserve to be jettisoned into the sun for their stupidity. I caught on the moment he mentioned that inception was possible.5. Waking Up/Dying in the Dream When you die in the dream world you come back up a level towards consciousness, as evidenced by the fact that they wake up when they get shot in the face in the first scene. But wait! When they die in the dream you actually go down to limbo as evidenced by that happening to the oriental guy, which sucks because that's where it's just 'pure subconscious' and you wake up a vegetable. But wait! You actually aren't in an endless limbo because Cobb and Molly went there once, but you still wake up a vegetable. But wait! You actually don't wake up a vegetable because Cobb and Molly didn't when they killed themselves on the train tracks. But limbo is still bad.......right? Because you can't get out without becoming mentally handicapped, but if you can kill yourself to get out at any time just like a normal dream then why is limbo even bad? And isn't inertia supposed to wake you up? Technically the van falling off the bridge should have woken them up, or even it rolling, not it hitting the water. If the force of hitting the water is what woke them up, then shouldn't anything like a slap to the face do it? In the end the movie suffered from the EXACT same things The Dark Knight did, and that is Chris Nolan's conflicting desires to make something believable and for sensationalism, and both cancelling out the other. If you wanted to compare it to the other obvious similar franchise,The Matrix actually is believable. Oh, yeah, now that I think of the matrix, how does a tiny needle plugged into their wrist plug them into an alternate reality in Inception? The base of the skull made sense, this is just silly. People keep saying this is the next Matrix, but the difference here is that literally twenty views later everything in the Matrix STILL makes sense, and I punched holes in this latest Leonardo Decrapio movie in one sitting. Pathetic."
23222,True,"UNDERWHELMING, LITERAL AND PRETENTIOUS.. These 3 words pretty much summed up the whole of Inception. Why populate the dream world with the same landscape and tone as the real world? Why the dreamers and their subconscious armed with real-world accessories and firearms? Why must the travel initiated with the actor's pretend sleep? Why does the levels are differentiated with only different decor? (Except the LIMBO realm) WHERE IS THE IMAGINATION? Nolan has the perfect opportunity to execute his wildest imaginations and he messed it up and served us mediocrity. Apparently, he only has the most literal interpretation of dreams. No quirky visual manifestation (mirror-world? top-down switched?), no mystical representation of the subconscious (shadows, shades, animals etc), No difference between dream levels (tones-darker?grayer?more grotesque?), No symbolic representative of weapons ( energy? aura's? light? dark? ). AND OF COURSE, the travel method!NOLAN could've presented a more sophisticated facade. Maybe a dream room with vivid machines powered with mysterious matter. Or for mobility, more visible contraptions for head, neck or body. Then, the transition can be cued with portals, or one's self entering the target's body or....to be more fantastical; the reality bleeds or tears itself into an underworld which is the dream.INSTEAD, what we've got is inferior chase and action set pieces. Save for the gimmicks of collapsing the landscape onto itself, making pathways, the movie's rather bland. It also features too many characters - the forgers, architects, point man, sedative-man, corporate-sponsor man.......you get it. IT SHOULD be anchored by one solid protagonist that's let say have a latent talent for some form of ability (dream-walker but is named with Latin words), his target and the source of his internal conflicts (family, lover, friend).This movie fools layman into thinking that they're smart.IT is basically an inferior imitation of Michael Bay's summer blockbuster disguised as a thinking man's movie. IT'S ABOUT CORPORATE ESPIONAGE - Tell people that and it would be 100% true. CERTAINLY NOT travel between dream worlds...."
23223,True,"But not for me. The movie unmasks itself as a very uninspired convoluted pseudo something when the protagonists have to find an alternative dream-tactic because their target protects himself. What they consider to be a new psychological trick is so plain and unoriginal that becomes clear with a 'kick' that Nolan was absolutely unaware of any scientific profound background by developing the plot. The plot within a plot within a plot is not automatically an ""intellectual"" challenging procedure when one plot is the exact mirror of the other. The challenge for me was to stay awake whilst the plot stumbles from one hole to the next:How do they get connected so that can dream the same dream? Chemically, physically?? How can they transport their conscious plans into their unconscious dreams and execute them there? Etc., Etc.I can't help it, but Nolan is one of the few directors in Hollywood who can direct any script as tedious as you can imagine. There are so many moments in that movie where i thought Wow, that could have been much more suspenseful if, for instance, Cameron or so had directed it.This movie is stupid. You can make a stupid plot 'intelligent' by nesting it multiple times, it just multiplies its stupidity. In this sense the next Nolan movie could be a even greater ""masterpiece"" for meat heads: when it has a dump base plot every fool can follow, but this time the plot is the plot in the plot in the plot in the plot in the.....that's challenging isn't it?"
23224,True,"Films about dreams and the subconscious are usually not very straightforward and almost always weird. ""Inception"" is no exception to that rule, but like its cinematic predecessors who have explored the contrast between and the questions of what is real and what is illusion (i.e. ""The Matrix"" (1999), ""The Cell"" (2000), ""Abre Los Ojos"" (1997) & its American remake ""Vanilla Sky"" (2001)), you really can't look away, nor should you.""Inception"" is an excellent and breathtaking movie that may be one of the only films released so far during the Summer of 2010 that lives up to its hype. It is a nearly perfect and highly original film that holds your attention until the credits roll. The less you know about this movie going in, the more you will be entranced by seeing it.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a world class criminal who, with the help of a team of sleep experts, works his way into people's subconscious and steals what people value most: ideas directly from their minds. In his last assignment to possibly clear his name, he is assigned not to steal an idea from someone, but to plant one inside that person's mind. The difficulty comes when certain people are trained to block their ideas from being taken.That plot summary only covers the basics of this pretty complicated story, but to describe every plot detail would take away the magic of this film you must see yourself to believe. DiCaprio is good in his role, but unlike many other films he has starred in, this is perhaps his only role where his character alone does not carry the weight of the movie on his shoulders or share it equally with one other co-star. Instead, this great ensemble cast teams together to make this movie work, just as their characters collaborate to pull off such a unique heist. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy are especially good in their roles.The special effects in this film were also very good, which is amazing considering their simplicity compared to the ""Matrix"" movies. There are slow-motion shots, but no impossible kung fu fighting sequences. It's especially interesting when the film gets into the architecture of certain dreams, and impossible sequences are filmed in a way I've never seen other than in drawings.However, the special effects would mean nothing if the story wasn't good. For this reason, even something as simple as a spinning top holds your attention in a way you would never think it would when seeing it in this film. The credit here can be given to writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has not made a bad film yet. There are many twists and turns in this film, but Nolan never loses his focus in the process of telling the story. If Nolan does not get nominated for Best Director and/or Best Original Screenplay next Oscar season, there is something terribly wrong with the Academy.That being said, there was still a lot about this film I still don't get, and may require multiple viewings to better understand. However, some of the best films I've seen are confusing at first. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) is a film I've seen a couple of times, and still don't understand completely. It still has a major following, though, as I'm positive this movie will. It's an incredibly entertaining movie, but it also makes you think and continues to do so after you leave the theater."
23225,True,"I have to say to make such an impressive trailer and such an uninteresting film, takes some doing.Here you have most of the elements that would make a very good film. You have great special effects, a sci-fi conundrum, beautiful visuals and good sound. Yet the most important part of the film is missing. There is no plot, character or soul to this film. It's like having a beautiful building on the outside with no paint or decoration on the inside.It's an empty shell of a film. There is no tension; you couldn't care less about any of the characters, why were they even motivated to do what they did. Helping a corporation get ""one over"" on another corporation is hardly saving the human race.When you operate in a dream environment, where you can't die or be injured really it means there is nothing to worry about, who cares what happens. All the explosions and actions sequences are just meaningless. By the way, why does Hollywood still keep filming action scene's an inch away from every characters nose? It's impossible to see what's going on, so many films are ruined by this. Watch and learn from the Matrix, take the camera backwards a couple of feet and we can actually work out what's going on.So 2 and half hours of looking at my watch waiting for the very predictable ending, is a million miles from being a good film. How anyone in their right mind can give this 10/10, it's boring and pointless. A film has stir the soul, has to grab you, you need to feel for the characters. Can anyone, honestly say, they cared about anyone on show here.By the way, here's an idea, why don't you bring the children (who haven't aged a minutes since you last saw them) to you, if you can't go to the US.I know the end scene was trying to be ambiguous, but the fact his father, who lives in Paris, is bizarrely there in the US to meet him (how did he know) and the children look identical to every dream sequence they appeared in, means there wasn't much doubt.In the end there is nothing at stake for anyone, so a pointless movie. I suspect Nolan will continue to get praise, but I can't really say I've got excited about any of his movies. They all leave me cold. They are not terrible, just there's nothing really there, no substance."
23226,True,"I'll begin by saying that I have an inbuilt prejudice against films that seem to put cleverness or 'intelligence' ahead of entertainment value. Having read a lot about this film, I wasn't sure whether I would like it, but in fact was very disappointed to end up disliking it as much as I did.For me, the film lacked two essential elements of an entertaining movie - a coherent plot and sympathetic characters. The plot didn't really start to make any sense until about halfway through (far too late) and Leonardo di Caprio as the central character, Cobb, was competent but just didn't have the charisma to carry this kind of story. His wife's death was foreshadowed a lot in the early part of the film and I found I just didn't care how or why she died. None of the other characters came across as real people and their connection to Cobb was generally unclear to me. The impression was of good actors (like Tom Hardy) being basically wasted.I almost switched off the film after the first twenty minutes because its chaotic action seemed designed almost to alienate the viewer. It started to make some sense after that, but was still a long way from what a good film should be. The over-reliance on sudden loud noises (way above the level of the dialogue) in the first half was simply irritating.The film also seemed to have trouble obeying its own internal logic. Several reviewers have mentioned that there was no consistency in what is supposed to happen when a dreamer dies during a dream; I was unimpressed by the 'projections' in the dreams apparently having their own personalities and being capable of independent thought, although the script also had them as nothing more than figments of the dreamer's imagination.Yes, the film's settings and special effects were impressive, but that's really not what an evening out (or in) should be about. If the story and characterisations are lacking, then why bother watching at all?"
23227,True,"I would have honestly given the movie a 7 but the current rating is very undeserving and I had no choice but to make the least contribution I could make to it. The writer/director of Inception thought if maybe they pretended to have a very complex plot and great special effects, the audience would not realize how pointless the whole story is. The audience were like; ""OH! Such a complex plot! A Genius!! A Masterpiece!!"" The first hour and a half all they do is explain the whole inception system without moving the plot forward. I am sure most of the audience didn't get what the movie was about but they pretended so they would not look stupid. And Christopher Nolan is going;""I don't really think of films in terms of light and dark...blah blah blah! I am a genius! blah blah blah! ...thriller that takes place in the mind...blah blah blah! I am a genius! blah blah blah!"" The intention of the film clearly reflected on itself. The point was not to entertain audience but rather it was a show-off of what artistic capability the director/writer possesses. It tried to point out the fact what a movie genius Christopher Nolan is. I mean I love this guy. The Prestige was great and so was the Dark Knight. But Inception was really showing off. Look at Kick-Ass, Watchmen and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. They were complete honest movies. Their intentions were clean and they reflected in the movie. They were meant for pure entertainment and that's what we got. On the other hand Inception was trying too hard. I could really point the fact on how the intentions of the movie was showing off but I would rather suggest the audience to watch the movie once again. They said the movie was very unpredictable. Suppose there is a man chopping onions in the movie and suddenly the chopped onions turned into a chicken. Now would that be predictable? They might say Cobb's wife living with him till old age in the dream was unpredictable. Are you serious!! How come you haven't seen that one coming!! It was so obvious! It is only the fact the way it was dramatized that made it seem unpredictable and shocking. Top 10 in the IMDb chart!!! Are you kidding me!!"
23228,True,"Inception no more explores dreams and the human mind than Star Wars explores outer space. Inception is a rip-off of the novel Fireflies in the Shadow of the Sun (FSS), published in 2004 but preceded by a web site on dreams (2001-2009), the thrust of which is about how dream experiences are the source of ideas and other changes to waking life, including personality development. The broader point is that like his character Dom Cobb, Nolan himself steals the ideas he needs to create Inception from a novelist and life long dream researcher.Chapter 7 titled ""Journey by Deflection"" occurs entirely in a shared dream in which 2 protagonists ascend / descend through ""levels of dreaming"" in action-oriented sequences and even a ""dream within a dream,"" addressing how intermittent awareness of the dreams affects the dream. But Inception does not (a) intrigue / illuminate as to how these levels are distinct and yet intrinsically related or (b) draw from real dreams and real similarities to waking life. Inception is just an action film set in dream space that neglects the essence of dreaming in dream symbolism. The dream space featured in Inception is fictitious -- a contrivance of both Nolan and of the architect in Nolan's story. Inception would have benefited by emulating FSS in the one way it did not emulate it. In FSS the characters trapped in the shared dream have to solve the dream's logic in order to wake up. This plot is much more conducive to an education of the language of dreams, which FSS author spent an entire lifetime understanding from the time he started a diary of his own dreams at age 13 to his doctoral dissertation at age 27 exploring the relationship between dream experiences, coping strategies, blood chemistry, and symptoms in terminally ill cancer patients. Like FSS however, and this is yet another coincidental similarity between the two works, in Inception the characters are thwarted by a dream that is plugged into their mental efforts to understand it. Also as in FSS, the dreamers have to deal with the denizens of a dream world that react to periodic episodes of lucid awareness of the dream. In FSS, the whole script, including objects and aspects of the environment, respond to the awareness, but in Inception we get the juvenile and scientifically ignorant development that other characters in the dream respond to Dom Cobb and his team like white blood cells to foreign pathogens. The bottom line is that FSS teaches us things about dreams and Inception will impress only the most psychologically unsophisticated among us or those who have never remembered a dream in their life.Also like FSS, Inception makes the point that much of the bizarreness of dreams is attributable to a higher-order thinking. It does this using a statement very similar to one from the former FSS web site, which maintained that while dreaming is a whole brain activity, the conscious person uses only about 3-5% of his or her brain. FSS author remarks that experiencing and trying to make sense of a dream is like trying to fit 100% of something into 3-5% of itself -- there will be distortion!The subject matter notwithstanding, Nolan's storytelling and direction are designed to give artificial weight to the real value of plot twists. In Nolan we have a director who conceals and compensates for second-rate thinking with CGI and high-octane action that detracts from the story without getting the blood flowing. The action in the film was supposed to create a sense of time-sensitive suspense, but came across more like the dull dishwater backing up in my sink than a raging river.There are also inconsistencies in the film. Nolan wants us to invest in the idea that everything that happens in a dream has an effect on the waking life of the dreamer. It works -- until Dom Cobb dismisses out of hand his shooting of all these dream characters like they were throngs of disposable orcs or storm troopers, claiming its OK because they are ""merely projections of the subconscious."" Suddenly, what happens in dream Vegas stays in dream Vegas. And where did the idea of ""limbo"" come from -- introduced as a patchwork device for a poorly articulated plot.And much of the film's premise is contradicted by real research which shows that the relationship between perceived and actual dream time is roughly 1:1."
23229,True,"This film really let me down.I didn't expect a great film but I expected something that was at least 'OK'. How wrong I was. I honestly can't understand the hype. 'Intelligent' they say?? What sort of intelligent film has to have it's protagonists explain what is happening continuously throughout the film?? Now Memento, that was a good film. And, I suppose, 'intelligent'. But by intelligent, I mean something that pushes boundaries of the viewer's understanding. I don't mean intelligent as in 1) able to do simple arithmetic, 2) develop reading and writing skills and 3) generally being one notch above a dolphin.OK, let's make a start shall we? Firstly, one of the greatest literary and cinematic arts is the use of metaphor. This film has none. One thing the film is full of is too much explanatory dialogue (not to mention pre-teen psychology - the father figure relationship in the subconscious). For example, in the first Matrix film, the viewer understands the profundity of what is being delivered through metaphor (a feature that the subsequent Matrix films sadly missed). In this film here, everything is painstakingly explained. To me, this speaks volumes.Secondly, great actors, yes. BUT ALL miscast and given appalling dialogue in an appalling script. I mean, Ellen Page was great in Juno, but here she comes out with painfully mechanical lines in the same way that Joseph Gordon-Levitt also does. In the same way that every character does. They ALL speak the same way and we are no better understanding one character by the end of the film than we were when they first appeared.Thirdly, logic. Philosophy. Call it what you want. Why was Ariadne chosen to become the architect? What does she actually DO??And Ken Watanabe. Why is he alive after dying on the third or fourth level 'down' in the subconscious after the film so adamantly stresses the dangers of dying in the 'dream'? How can he wake up on the plane?? Why, in fact, is there that scene at the start of the film where he appears old and which features the safe and the confidential papers Leonardo De Caprio finds.Why does Leonardo De Caprio constantly have to furrow his brow? Oh, yes, it's a vain attempt to look mean and manly because the poor man still has, unfortunately for him, such a baby face.Why is Cillian Murphy's character chosen to be their means of helping LDC's character get back to his kids? And isn't it convenient to have a dream sequence in a blockbuster that resembles a James Bond film snow-covered chase scene? Why does the film have to go on for two and a half hours instead of one and a half? And most importantly, if Leonardo De Caprio's character is so severely screwed up about his wife why, o why does he have to be the main character in this film? Couldn't the team work with someone more well-balanced?? Can he in fact be any use to his kids if he eventually finds them???Nonsense nonsense nonsense. Big pile of nonsensical psycho-babble. And yes, where else but America???"
23230,True,"People who are reviewing this as the best movie they have ever seen seriously needs to wake up from their dreams. I don't know who planted this idea in their brain that this is directorial tour-de-force by Nolan but one thing is for sure, Ledger saved Nolan's glutes bigtime. His screen writing technique is feeble; creativity doesn't merely consist of just going berserk with visual treat and showing whatever comes in a ten second unchecked, brainstorming session rather creativity requires constraint. And this movie lacked any constraint whatsoever.If it wasn't for the ultracool visual effects and graphics this movie would be nothing but a vacuous thought bubbles of a person. Whereas Nolan's Dark Knight, instilled by Ledger's genius, was entirely character driven, this movie was entirely fueled by graphical eye-candies. A movie resonates over time when you want to watch certain scenes from it over and over and over again in youtube or your blu-ray disc rented from your local Chinese 99c video store. There were no witty dialogs or any memorable scene in the film that will compel me to stay transfixed in the screen and rewind it over and over and over again.Movies like Vanilla Sky had the same concept yet was made more artfully where the director didn't go overboard with visual scenes while having barely substantial plot.People need to seriously have a reality check. But if majority of the viewers are giving positive reviews, and if you are the only one going against the crowd that surely means there is something ""wrong"" in your system? Tsk, tsk, tsk what naysayers won't realize is that it would be more comforting to delude oneself and jump on the bandwagon saying it was great film, than admit that they got ""jipped"" $10.00 for some Sony Vegas type of wizardry. Hey it's the summer after all and it's not ""cool"" to say things which may otherwise offend your friends!"
23231,True,"Cobb is a extractor, he enters the minds of powerful people and takes their ideas. Only his latest case is not as simple, instead of taking an idea, he must implant one; however Cobb is a man whose own sub-conscience is in disarray as his dead wife threatens to destroy him.I thought originally when I watched the trailer...""Interesting...But I've seen this somewhere before?""And then as I watched the film it hit me..'Paprika!', Paprika is a anime were a therapist enters the minds of patients to distinguish the problem.I am not saying that the film is a complete copy, because its not...However, the complexity of the film is quite confusing at times, even for a life long sci-fi fan; I guess that was the allure when you consider the many, many positive and glowing reviews. I enjoyed some of the action sequences, but it did not really keep me on the edge of my seat. Cillian Murphy and Ken Wattanbe, were the true stars in my opinion, they played their roles very well, while Leonardo DiCaprio was one dimensional, even though he was supposed to be the most complex and intriguing character in the film."
23232,True,"What do we ask for in a summer blockbuster? What is it that incites hysteria this time every year for whatever dross the studios churn out? Epic hugeness? Blowing stuff up? Romance? Action? Heroes? What are we looking for in a blockbuster? I think it all boils down to thrills! Audiences want the thrill of a car chase, the thrill of romance, the thrill of the spectacular! If that is the case, then Inception just might be the greatest summer blockbuster of all time as it also contains something we often don't look for...brains! ""What is the most resilient parasite? An idea"" says Leonardo Di Caprio's character Cobb. Well, Inception is all about ideas. It's all right there in the title. The film central idea revolves around ""Extractors"", who are paid to extract secrets from people's subconscious minds by sneaking into their dreams, usually for the purpose of corporate espionage. However, when one client asks them to plant an idea in the mind of their corporate rival, ""Inception"" is born. The less said about this film the better. It is full of ideas and invention and for each set piece I divulge, a piece of the film's genius is weakened. This is a film that cleverly and intricately brings the audience through several planes of existence simultaneously but never allows the viewer to feel lost. Such is the power of Christopher Nolan's script which, I imagine, is likely to get overlooked due to the sheer visual magnificence of his direction. But everything that makes this film so great is in the script...in the ideas! Everything else is just spectacle. This film bears an uncanny resemblance, thematically, with DiCaprio's other instant classic this year, Shutter Island. Both films investigate in depth the tricks a traumatised mind can play on the individual. Both films are luscious to watch and both films keep the audience firmly outside the realm of reality. However, Inception is an even more layered film than Shutter Island and I believe the sci-fi genre setting will prove to be less alienating for audiences than the prison noir of Scorsese's film. There is not a single dull moment in Nolan's film. There is style, charm and intelligence in every frame of the film. Every performance is pitch-perfect with some strong support by Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt particularly who have grown up right before our eyes into undeniable movie stars. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a typically flawless performance as the muddled, grieving man who we never quite trust to be living in the real world. The best part of Inception is the large amount of effects which were done in camera. While the film does make use of CGI, there are some pretty mind-blowing practical effects which are as simple as the camera telling beautiful lies; a rare treat these days. This is a blockbuster that ticks all the boxes; smart, sexy (femme fatale, sexy brainy girl, very beautiful men in very beautiful suits) and magical. Inception is the kind of film that reminds me why cinema will never die. Because anyone who thinks it's OK to watch this film on a laptop or iPad is a fool! This is pure cinema, and proud of it. Not to be missed on the big screen!"
23233,True,"Inception is an interesting movie, however I did not enjoy it. I go the movies to be entertained, to be transported into the movie, to be involved and have my emotions stirred. Inception did none of that, it failed because it focused on the creativity but forgot about the audience. Credit must be given to the special effects, the acting and the creative content, but the praise stops there.I have read a lot of the reviews here and I have to say I'm very surprised, I simply don't agree with the high rating this movie has been awarded with. If you would like to watch an interesting, creative and action packed movie, this will not disappoint. For me, there were too many implausible (bordering on ridiculous) twists to enable me to enjoy it. The technical aspects surrounding the connectivity between the participants was just nonsense, there was little explanation, little offered on how it worked and why. Clearly someone thought the audience would just let that part slide and not be too fussed about the technicalities.This is a selfish movie, its been written, produced and directed to be creative, amazing and intelligent.. the problem is someone forgot about the audience. I for one was not engaged, transported nor were my emotions stirred..apart from feeling annoyed and disappointed.I expected so much more from this movie.."
23234,True,"This movie is so predictable that it takes all of 10 minutes to figure it out. At that stage you know you're going to waste another 2 and a half hours watching the nonsense where people slip in and out of dreams in an attempt to fabricate a story where there was no story.The plot starts in the first few minutes and ends in the last few minutes, everything in between... well... is better left unwatched.If you haven't figured it out immediately, then chances are you won't by the time it's over, in which case you're also wasting 2 and a half hours of your time.The only thing I got from watching this horrible overrated bloated cinematic experiment was a wish to kill myself. Maybe I'm dreaming, too?"
23235,True,"Wow what have we here? What hast thou put before our eyes? Could it be Christopher Nolan's boorish tripe 'Inception'? I myself could not tell as the movie was far too low brow to make even the slightest impression on my vastly superior intelligence. Nolan is an amateur who makes movies based on blatantly foreseeable childish artifices that only the most unintelligent boors would find the least bit amusing. 'Inception' is the kind of film designed to make lamebrains feel like they are intelligent. Nolan's intellectualism-for-dummies should be the main title of his biography. Luckily I am smart enough to see past this charade and give the people their fair assessment of this tripe.'Inception' is built upon the notion of traveling through dream like spaces that bend time, space, and reality, yawn. It's been done before Chris in a much sounder fashion in Charlie Kaufman's epic masterpiece 'Synecdoche, New York'. That film is an orgasmic experience while 'Inception' is just beyond words describing it. I mean you might conclude that the inner subconscious would be more creative in coming up with better metaphors for security than guys with guns who chase you. The lengthy exposition- oh I mean training montage, despite having a semi-acceptable computer effect, was way more boring and less engaging than the scene it stole from 'The Matrix', and at least that scene didn't have Nolan's pretentiousness. Larry the Cable Guy is less insulting to the intellect. I mean Sarah Palin sounds smarter than Christopher Nolan's dialogue. ( Conjointly, the Herculean careener of mesh networks is titled Ariadne? Really? None of the juveniles that give you your millions will get that reference Chris but I'm glad you know how to use wikipedia)"
23236,True,"I have never lost interest in a film faster than this one, and I have watched some pretty terrible movies e.g. paranormal activity! (like when the girl gets dragged a...way! OMG never laughed so much in my life b4!) . It was a ridiculous waste of resources that could have been put towards ... I dunno folding socks? How they managed to make it so ""popular"" I do not know.It was pretentious more than anything. It had this strange, ""this is the best film of all time because we folded a street over"" vibe to it. It was nothing but special effects which i must say were nice but the actual story itself was perpetuated with unspecified technology, chemicals, rules and really bad acting from some really good actors! When you watch a film of this caliber and I use the term lightly, you should be entertained, not bored and scared. They told the story in less than five minutes!***** Don't read this bit if you plan on watching the film ******* They have to change the mind of a guy whose dad is dying; for money and they do it by going into his brain in three levels THAT IS ALL IT IS! SERIOUSLY THAT IS THE WHOLE STORY ALL THE REST IS FILLER!!!!!*******************************************************************They might of as well put in Peter Griffin grabbing his knee in pain and the naive audience would be none the wiser. It isn't a clever film! It isn't even entertainment. It's just noise!"
23237,True,"It is obvious people do enjoy psychological thrillers, virtual reality, and Leonardo DiCaprio. Inception, having it all, will astonish and marvel crowds of cinema goers into thinking they are smart and profound just for getting or liking the movie. I have to say, I admire the movie's performance into tricking its viewers like that; because that's what it is, a trick. A dream within a dream, and doesn't that sound attractive...It is the kind of movie that gets nominated for Oscar just for its crowd pleasing abilities, and Oscars are born within the capitalist world and needs all the capital it can get. Just like Avatar got nominated in the ""best movie"" category... I've read some review saying Inception could be the movie of the decade; obviously, the guy didn't see that many movies in the last ten years; there are better movies in 2010 only, and a bunch of them.I'm not saying the movie is bad; it's a good movie for its genre; what I didn't like about it is the fuss it created (and that fuss will disappear like it disappeared before for other crowd adored films), but mostly its lack of authenticity, therefore its PRETENTIOUSNESS.This is not a gem - it is a pile of dust in the eyes."
23238,True,"I waited patiently to see this in my updated home theater on Blu-ray with anticipation and excitement, mainly based on the high scores given it by IMDb and the knowledge that it had everything; cast, sound, scenery, story, etc. OK, it looked impressive, it was loud enough, but after 2 ½ hours my jaw was on floor in utter amazement at how stupid people can be praising this trash - lemmings. But maybe it's explainable: The ten star reviews here are from those either involved directly in the marketing of this film or 9 year old boys using their parents credentials to praise an adolescent epic or I suppose idiots who swallow tripe and enjoy making recommendations to others about how yummy their tripe tasted. The latter I almost doubt as the intellectually challenged might have difficulty in forming sentences and operating a computer machine so just who are these thousands of reviewers praising theatrical garbage? It absolutely has to be my first guess; Armies of trolls hired by the makers of Crapception.I can't even get myself to offer my reasons for disliking this film as there's nothing to review but I'll try: The repetitive overlapping of scenes seemed more to me like a demo video testing the CGI production equipment. The complete absence of explanation as to how someone can actually share a dream I feel was the biggest hole, and the hole just got deeper and deeper and more deep and then deeper still resulting in probably the most shallow of scripts ever produced for that much money.I typically like DiCaprio but the Cisco girl; Ellen Page was annoying, felt like I had a bad Juno dream during a TV commercial selling conferencing equipment and a horribly dressed adolescent was trapped in my dream spun mind. OK, that last sentence could have come straight from the writers pen of this horrible script.Not all is lost however, a valuable lesson was learned in how I will now use IMDb. I feel I can no longer rely on the score of films here and will, instead, sort reviews by lowest rank and make my viewing decisions from there. My biggest disappointment is the watering down of what once was a great resource for movie choices: IMDb. Since I'm a movie addict I've relied on IMDb since its inception, pun intended, but with Inception's 8.7 score I now see the source data is tainted and the source unreliable. IMDb might be able to fix this by taking measures to identify the reviewers and allow us to sort by them: Kids, adults, trolls, (multiple reviews from a single IP address for example) OK, maybe it's not that easy, the WEB is fraught with mistruths and deception for insipid products and offerings so why would my favorite web site be immune from this condition? I give this film 2 stars for pretty colors and loud noises."
23239,True,"As long as it remains possible to spend 100 million dollars on making drivel, setting aside 10 million towards advertising in order to tell people that it's great so that they've spent 200 million on tickets before they find out otherwise, there'll be no incentive for Hollywood movie-making ever to improve.I've reviewed Angelina Jolie's latest farrago in very similar terms. While that movie bizarrely assumes that the Cold War still remains of interest to anyone (?), ""Inception"" insists basically that it's interesting to watch other people's dreams. Well, visually it can be - the ""architecture-bending"" style of ""Inception"" would have had great appeal, maybe in a 60-second advert for a credit card or mobile phone company.But visual appeal aside, the ""plot"" of the movie is not so much multi-layered as multi- pointless. The old cliché that ""if you die in dream you wake up"" is hauled out here with monotonous regularity, but it's never applied consistently, and even if it were, who cares? If you MUST fire a machine gun at someone in a dream (and I can't think of any reason why you'd really need to), why would you ever run out of bullets? Wouldn't you just dream up some more? If you want to blow up a dream hotel, do you really NEED dream explosives? If the fuse goes out, is it safe to return, or should you always light the dreamy blue touchpaper and stand well back? The movie's makers assume that multi-layering these various dream levels will be endlessly fascinating (as evidenced by the enormous running time), but anyone with an ounce of discernment will simply become less and less connected as the plot becomes ""deeper"". We're in the same childish, ill-conceived territory here as many movies about existing in ""virtual reality"" or even ""on the holodeck"". Simulate as convincingly as you like, but you can't change the laws of physics in the real world, and if you're in a dream, then there's no real need to worry about being stabbed or shot, and neither should the viewer care whether the characters are, or aren't.The urban myth being put about that ""Inception"" includes some sort of interesting or unexpected ending is no more than that.For a witty, snappy meditation on alternative reality, try Cronenberg's ""eXistenZ"", and (despite the fact that, like, when you're dreaming you know, your life goes really slowly and, like, you can live a whole lifetime in the dreamy dream state, man) try to give this bloated waste of time a miss."
23240,True,"easily one of the worst films ever made, that some critics fell for it, just shows how bad today's professional critics have become. no doubt all the 14 to 18 year old Nolan fan boys are going to attack all of us, that have seen through this psycho babble non sense. ultimately the worst thing about the film is that it was utterly boring, from start to finish. at no time to you feel anything for any characters, the dialogue is of such a juvenile nature he must have got a 14 year old to write it. the guy has no idea of what dreams are what takes place during them, i will not go into any philosophical or psychological discussion here as the film does not warrant them, giving there is no sense in anything that is said or done. like dark knight this will have its time in the sun and in a few years the very same people who raved about it will wonder why. as for the ending with the top still spinning telling the audience that anyway it was all still a dream, totally makes the whole exercise futile. shame that a once good film maker has gone right up his proverbial"
23241,True,"Philosophically it was absurd. Here were the main points I gathered from it: Faith and doubt are discussed, but the conclusion is that having faith doesn't matter because you can't know what's real anyways. What did the Japanese businessman's non-faith avail him or di Caprio's character's faith avail him? They both ended up having the same destiny, no? So, freewill is an illusion, too. Skepticism is the only valid approach to life. Existentialism is true; we really do make life to be whatever we want it to be. Top remains spinning at end, or does it eventually topple? Was it dream or reality? Who knows? Does it matter? No, existentialism says we can define our own reality to our liking. Relativism of truth: i.e., truth is whatever you make it up to be. Subjectivism / idealism / Cartesianism / Kantianism, i.e., ideas are all that are real. If the senses are to be 100% distrusted for determining what is real, we might all be as insane (possessed) as the Dark Knight's Joker. Objective reality, for all practical purposes, does not exist. Every subject just makes up his or her own reality. This leads to solipsism and ultimately a suicidal nihilism. Murder can be justified as long as the person you are killing is someone's ""projection."" Di Caprio's character snipes men in the snow scene to the architect girl's surprise; he justifies this by saying they are just another man's ""projection."" Magic potions (i.e., potent drugs) are the solution to anyone's problems.Christopher Nolan should brush-up on some real, Aristotelean-Thomistic philosophy, but then maybe the movie would not have fooled the audience into thinking it is profound instead of absurd. There were good partsthe importance of fatherhood and family, for examplebut they were overshadowed by ambiguity for the sake of ambiguity.Also, artistically, it could've done without most of the car-chase and shooting scenes and confronted more head-on the philosophical issue it was raising, i.e., ""What is real? What is being, existence? Etc,"" rather than hiding its ignorance in a silly plot scheme involving ""kicks,"" ""inception,"" and other Freudian, postmodern rubbish. If it were 1 hour shorter, it would have still been the same: absurdity at its best."
23242,True,"Ten years he did about this story, Christopher Nolan. I hardly understand what is so difficult to understand about this would be intellectual piece of rubbish about a dream within a dream within a dream. This is just what Night M Shyamalan has done in all of his movies. Boring us to death with a boring story for about 9/10th of the movie and then to give us an 'amazing ending', the ending here being that in fact it is not a three layered dream but about a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream so 4 layers, at least that's what my impression is as the spinning thing at the end is the talisman of either the wife or Leonard di Caprio.From the trailer this seemed to be a brilliant movie but I should have been warned by my colleagues from work, one leaving the theater before the ending and all of the others not understanding what the fuss was all about and right they are.Before this year I never believed that Leonardo di Caprio was able to play adult characters (if any at all) after watching Titanic years ago. Now I'm dead sure of it after watching Shutter island and Inception this year.Characters without character so you don't give a damn about them; endless ridiculously action scenes certainly towards the end working to an action climax that is incredibly foreseeable (dream layers ending at the same time); heavy pseudo sophisticated acting that gets on your nerves quickly. In one sentence: the biggest scam since The matrix though the Wachowski brothers are even bigger crooks as they scammed the world three times. What idiots us the public are, are we not? I have no problem with 'amazing ending' movies at least if they would make the effort to give you a story leading up to it. Here there is none.I agree there are really serious bad things to get offended about in the world, but when we feel offended in real life about being conned with situations or a product, we should be too when we are scammed in the movie theater.The 1 point I give for this movie is for the 'street bending' special effect (the other effects being rather tedious and pure special effects for the effect)."
23243,True,"It could possibly be Leonardo DiCaprio. That's a bit harsh  I know he has to eat too  but does he have to always play the same sanctimonious, pedantic, self-righteous know-it-all? And he's been in some bad movies recently. ""Revolutionary Road"" was a potentially good movie, but he always comes off as immature. ""Shutter Island"" was so transparent that I guessed the ending about 10 minutes in. But, this is supposed to be about ""Inception""...Yes, ""Inception"", a movie so simplistic that I yawned throughout. My (lucky) wife fell asleep claiming that it wasn't of interest to her. What claimed to be a smart, intelligent thriller, turned out to be the usual bag of guns, explosions, chases, etc. The plot, paper-thin and without any real point, is a yawn-fest of borrowed ideas and takes liberally from movies we've seen before. Is 10 years really soon enough to remake ""The Matrix"" (with Ellen Page as Neo)? Dennis Quaid in ""Dreamscape"" is far more entertaining. ""Videodrome"" is way more complex and intriguing, a movie that makes the viewer work.While the acting is fair enough for an action flick, there isn't much to say about the movie at all. It's pretty 1-dimensional and quite dumb. What really irks me is the fact that I was told repeatedly about how this movie was so complex, complicated, hard to understand, etc. It's really not. It just uses a nonsensical plot device; that of layered dreaming, to try and outwit the audience. While completely ridiculous  isn't a dream within a dream just part of the same dream?  it's also not hard to grasp. Is the bar really that low? What would the audience that this bamboozled make of a movie like ""Primer"" which is one of the most complex movies ever devised. Even ""Mission Impossible"" had more plot twists and turns than this drivel.To be honest it was barely just okay. It was boring like a bus-ride through Nebraska. Your mind is the scene of the crime? I didn't see much of any crime - just some folks trying to get a guy to change his mind. Big deal. Michael Caine is even becoming a Director's Trademark. His two minutes on-screen were gratuitous at best, certainly not a requirement to the story.So, to wrap up: boring, simple-minded, dumb, nonsensical plot with no 'science' and barely any 'fiction', less-than-average acting, annoying constant music while people are talking, convenient 'get-outs' when the logic of the story fails, which is frequently. Wow, I actually think I hate this movie."
23244,True,I must admit I was really looking forward to this film but as with most of the big blockbusters in recent years it was a rather overrated experience. A good cast and some good acting but an overly complicated script and convoluted way of going about stuff using ideas from a lot of decent films that have gone before. The argument that if you don't like it you are too dumb to understand it does not wash as it's easy enough to understand what's going on but why it's going on does not make that much sense. One example is that for no sensible reason Leo is involved in a domestic situation that results in his wife's death and now seems to be worldwide public enemy number one?We have the usual assembling of an elite team to go in and carry out the usual impossible mission with consequences that are unknown to most of the team members that will impact on their success or not. Well that's original.Chucking sci-fi babble into a story does not always enhance the story and most of the inception idea tech talk is boring and nonsensical.The 'shock' ending is predictable and has been signposted since pretty much the start of the film which was overlong and overcomplicated and not at all as intelligent as it was made out to be. Like Shutter Island Leo is once again involved in a film that promises a lot but delivers not a great deal. Some spectacular sets and nice effects cannot cover up an ordinary fun bit of sci-fi nonsense passed off as genius. Like Avatar before it thinking it is some kind of genre changing piece of film when its just a half decent bit of entertainment that will linger with an audience until they get to the car park of KFC.Thought provoking cinema seems destined to be left behind for this kind of multi layered pseudo sci-fi babble which looks pretty but is not as clever as it likes to think.
23245,True,"Many of us, not least those who populate the online world with movie reviews, observations and criticisms, are aware of Chris Nolan's raw talent. Memento broke onto the screen a decade ago and provided us with a spectacle in story telling so rare that it dumbfounded us. Since then, Nolan has gained huge popularity with his revival of the Batman franchise, and even more so with the stunning Dark Knight - that still has yet to relinquish its grip on modern day cinema - with the genius of The Prestige sandwiched in between.None of this, however, could have quite prepared us for the spectacle that is INCEPTION. A script that has been worked on for over a decade, Nolan's endeavours are inescapable in its pure complexity and brilliance - quite simply, one of the best film story lines audiences will have encountered in their lifetime. All this is supplemented superbly by the film's ensemble cast - DiCaprio's performance cannot easily be done justice without seeing it. With this and Shutter Island, now must be the time for his first Oscar - he has asserted his place as truly one of the best actors currently working. All reviews will confirm that Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy and Ellen Page back his performance up superbly with well-worked turns. Inception's action sequences play out wonderfully, being - along with the comic relief and back-stories - an integral part of the film's unravelling, whilst we remain rooted to the film's emotional stakes, which give immense purpose to the film's complex and layered narrative.Our protagonist battles with both outer and inner demons in his quest for redemption. The unique concept of entering dreams offers the opportunity not only for a unique species of heist but also a way to dig deeper and deeper into one's subconscious, and the ability to plant an idea which could define that person, or destroy them. In theaters around the world, Nolan uses his dynamic skill to plant an idea in our minds which together allows us to experience the very dream- share the film explores, one which will remain with us long after the film's emotional climax. Inception is a cinema experience so audacious, so incredible, and in the end so gratifying, that it truly is unmissable, and will remain a benchmark for many filmmakers in years to come.10/10."
23246,True,"This tried to be another matrix - but a) there was already one matrix b) as silly as the matrix is, this is much sillier c) the matrix had some personality, this move has no feel whatsoeverBest example of the lameness would be the ""introduction scene"" where Dicaprio's character (totally forgettable) shows the young architect the dream world. This scene was totally forgettable compared to the epic action scene between Morpheous and Neo (""Stop trying to hit me and hit me"")Also - there is hardly any build up - it goes from 2 layers of dreams to 6, whats the build up? more layers of dreams? Ridiculous."
23247,True,"Before Leonardo DiCaprio agreed to play the lead part in 'Inception', he spent months with Christopher Nolan trying to improve the script. It was at DiCaprio's insistence that the part he was playing, Cobb, the corporate dream extractor, had to have a more beefed up internal arc. Otherwise, Inception would turn out to be another shallow, action adventure thriller. Despite Cobb's triumph over his internal demons (particularly the way in which he expunges his dead wife, who has been haunting him in his subconscious), Inception is much more an exploration of the mechanics of dreaming than a chronicle of emotional catharsis. At the basic level, Inception can be divided into four distinct parts: Intro, Exposition, Journey and Resolution. The Intro consists of the initial scene, a flashback where Cobb must save his employer, a sleazy Japanese businessman, Saito, now far advanced in years, who has been stuck in a limbo-like purgatory for decades, unaware that he was mortally wounded in someone else's dream. It's a nice, little compact scene where we see a near-dead Cobb, washed up on a beach and dragged into Saito's fortress compound. A gun is left on the table in front of Saito and we're trying to figure out whether Saito is going to kill Cobb or himself. Cut to the next scene where Cobb and his associate are involved in a trying to extract information from a much younger Saito inside one of his dreams, as they all sleep on a bullet train somewhere in Japan. Apparently, Saito was expecting the dream extractors and informs them that this is their 'audition'; the extractors' 'architect', the guy in charge of designing the dreamworld, somehow lets things get out of control when a mob of men invade the room where they're all staying, and Saito later has his thugs toss the architect off the roof of a heliport. Despite the botched job, Saito is impressed that Cobb and his partner are able to move through different 'levels' in the dreamworld. Cobb's 'audition' could have been compressed into one or two minutes but Nolan insists on illustrating every aspect of his convoluted plot. We finally arrive at the film's inciting incident: Saito's proposal to Cobb that he enter the dream world of his business rival, Fischer, and plant a suggestion in his subconscious, leading to the dissolution of the rival's entire business empire. 'Inception' is the reverse of what Cobb and his team have been trained to doextracting information and Cobb has doubts about successfully carrying out Saito's proposal. But when Saito promises to pull some strings, enabling Cobb to return to the United States, despite murder charges hanging over his head, Cobb can't resist jumping at the chance to see his two children again.The next part of 'Inception', the 'exposition', takes about an hour. This is where Cobb assembles his new carefully selected ""Mission Impossible"" superstar team who will penetrate Fischer's mind and plant the suggestion to break up his dying father's business empire. Nolan's explanation of the mechanics of the dreamworld is so complicated, that he has Cobb explain it to his new architect, a naive graduate student who manages to acquit herself rather well despite facing major obstacles inside multiple dreamworlds. Nolan manages to violate a major tenet of screen writing technique: Show don't tell. Unfortunately, during these expository sequences, there's a lot more 'tell' than 'show'. Yes, there is a rather neat scene (reminiscent of an M. C. Escher illustration), where one Paris landscape folds on top of another but most of the visuals are much more mundane: for example, a speeding locomotive appears out of nowhere during a car chase on a Paris street.Much has been written about the 'journey' aspect of 'Inception'. Critics seem to be impressed by the three dreamworlds the 'dream team' penetrates, coupled with the way in which they're able to return to realitythe so-called 'kicks', where a huge sound or explosion propels them through the different levels back up to the surface. Nolan, however, serves up some of the dullest and derivative landscapes that our 'heroes' must navigate throughin fact, these so-called dreams don't look like dreams at all. Take Level 1just a typical shoot em up with faceless bad guys chasing the 'good guys'. As for level 2I felt I was watching a parody of Space Odyssey, with our dreamers floating through a hotel without the benefit of gravity. Finally, I have heard 'Level 3', compared to 'Ice Station Zebra', the schlocky 60s action film set in the Arctic.Inception's Resolution is as unsatisfying as the earlier parts of the film. What are we to make of Cobb? Just because he has made this deal with Saito and it enables him to see his children, does not mitigate the fact that the whole plan to literally change Fischer's mind, is reprehensible. After all, shouldn't have Cobb walked away when Saito had his men murder the first architect? Cobb, by and large, remains a tainted and unsympathetic character, precisely because he looks the other way when he's quite aware that Saito has committed murder.We're also told (by Saito) that the breakup of Fischer's empire is a good thing but should we take his word for it? He's a thug and Nolan has provided us nothing to go on to evaluate the nature of the Fischer empire. Finally, why does Fischer cry at his father's deathbed? He's just learned that his father put his mother in a mental institution so shouldn't he be angry? Or are those tears of joy so that he can be now 'his own man'?The bulk of 'Inception' is merely a pastiche of mediocre action adventure espionage thrillers dating back to the 60s when the genre was in full bloom. The long-winded 'B' story, Cobb's tortured machinations in trying to literally kick his dead wife out of his subconscious mind, merely serves to distract us from the hollowness of the overall plot."
23248,True,"No, not intellectually: there's tons of thought (or at least editing) going on in this film. But there's no characterization, there's no heart (Leo's one anguished cry of ""Jesus, noooo!"" isn't ""heart,"" it's badly directed overacting), and, worst of all, there's no morality.I'm an ill-tempered, outspoken, foul-mouthed termagant (that by way of explanation for those about to call me a right-winger, a teabagger, or a prude), but when I watched this thing I was dumbstruck not on an intellectual level (oh, golly gee, we're dream-diving! Like in ""The Matrix,"" only inside brains instead of a mainframe! Wow. Uh, sure.) but on a moral one. See, the film has NO PROTAGONIST. It has criminals, it has those who facilitate those criminals' activities, and it has a victim. That's all.And, yes, I had-- and have-- a real (or is that ""real""-- see, I'm of the camp that thinks the whole sorry mess took place in Cobb's bigger mess of a head) problem with that.Almost no one (I would have opted for a plain, sweeping ""No one,"" no ""almost,"" but I recall one review among dozens and dozens that hit on what I'm about to say) seems to see anything wrong with the idea that Cobb and his crew are (ostensibly-- pretermitting for the time being the perpetual argument regarding whether the whole sorry scenario is or isn't a dream) performing an act of mental violation on an innocent man. Why is this? The action isn't that impressive (even the infamous hotel-corridor sequence)-- yes, Nolan does ""loud"" and ""in your face"" very well, but the Bond films have been doing more breathtaking and cleanly shot action work for four decades now. (I actually laughed out loud when Cobb and Arthur, decked out in pimp-fashion leather coats and stocking masks, shouted threats at kidnapped Robert Fischer in a dream-warehouse-- not, of course, to be confused with a warehouse of dreams (that might invoke imagination): what, you couldn't just have your goons strong-arm a kidnappee in the ""real"" world, Nolan? This is as creative as you can get?) We can't just proffer ""Cobb must see his kids again at any cost!"" as an excuse-- or can we? (I would certainly hope not.) Is it because Fischer is a Caucasian businessman, and therefore intrinsically deserving of attack in this economically volatile era? (The argument that Fischer's business rival Saito is somehow bravely trying to prevent Fischer from forming a monopoly is weak at best: that's what anti-monopoly laws are for, and, by agreeing to attack Fischer on Saito's behalf, Cobb is merely enabling Saito to form a monopoly of his own. And, seriously, inception and/or extraction would be ridiculously iffy forms of espionage. Break into the safe inside my skull, Cobb my boy, and enjoy the five hundred verses of ""I'm 'Enry the Eighth, I Am"" I've got planted there.) Or is it, possibly worst of all, because Cobb and his goons ""kindly"" leave Fischer with happy thoughts of his coldhearted father? (From monopolies to psychiatry, then: if Robert Fischer has daddy issues, that's what analysts are for. Cobb and his stampeding creeps are in Fischer's mind to commit a crime; any ""resolution"" they provide him is a byproduct of that crime, and resoundingly, cruelly false.)We might argue that Cobb and his crew are anti-heroes, but they're not. ""The Dirty Dozen"" are anti-heroes, criminals and psychopaths nonetheless working for the forces of good by fighting an evil greater than themselves (that evil being the nasty Nazis); Dom Cobb is nothing more than a thief (and, despite the ad copy, not a very good one) perpetrating an insidious act of mental rape against an innocent man (and, by extension, all those who rely on that innocent man's business for their livelihoods). Why all the sympathy for this thug and his crew? What's the catch? When children are involved, or when guilt (real or imagined) is in the mix, are we just supposed to chuck morality out the window...? (The last sad thing, I guess: No one on the team, not even newbie Ariadne-- and, granted, she's likely either a figment of Cobb's imagination, like the story as a whole, or a plant-- questions the ""right"" of what they're doing. Not only does this make me deeply uncomfortable, it's incredibly shallow writing. An opportunity for character development, tossed. But that's classic Nolan, isn't it? If he can't cover it with an iconic grunt-- ""She was lovely,"" Arthur deadpans to Ariadne, when Ariadne asks what nasty dream-shade Mal was like when she was alive (heck, Arthur, she's still, technically, ""lovely""; we were looking for maybe just a touch of explanation here regarding her relationship with Cobb and the team, big boy)-- it doesn't get covered.) Or, in the end, are we just supposed to excuse the immorality of the situation by saying, ""Ha! It's all a dream anyway!""? Very much bothered by this, especially since this behemoth has gulped down some one billion dollars in box-office take worldwide....... and that's why I'm giving it two stars. Cillian Murphy looks very nice in his natty suits, and he cries very prettily before Nolan realizes that-- horrors!-- someone is emoting on screen, and jerk-cuts away. Marion Cotillard does her best to squeeze dimensionality from yet another one-d Nolan-woman part; as Mal, she's a sad, psychotic, lovely mess. One star for each of them. As for the rest of it: what a pathetic reflection on values, and what a lousy story. Excellent snow-job, Mr. Nolan, but no star for you."
23249,True,"I'm not even going to waste my time writing a review, it would get lost in the ""dream world"" of positive reviews. Those who are making this out to be something profound or mind-boggling are also delusional.All it is is a muddy film with tons of plot holes and slightly better-than-average special effects. I am completely amazed at the comments about this being something more than it is. ""The Matrix"" was far, far better, made far more sense and offered far more insight into human nature, love, etc.Nolan has made a ""cluster f__k"" that must have subliminally messaging going on in some theaters cuz nobody in our theater enjoyed it very much. The acting is superb. There's one really cool scene of Paris defying gravity. Other than that there is nothing new and there is little or no logical plot line. It is just as my title says, convoluted. I'm a writer and this is the kind of stuff I delete from my novels when I begin to stray or run on.There's one review here that understands what is going on with the people who have fallen for this nightmare... he says ""There are movies for stupid people. There are movies for smart people. Then there are movies for people who like to think they're smart."" He has hit the proverbial nail on the head. This is a movie a few, likely stoned college fanboys go to see, start a conversation about ""what if..."" and create something out of nothing. Any intelligent person begins to have serious trouble coming up with answers that truly fit the massive questions in Nolan's script. To pass it off as ""well, it's all a dream"" is just a cop out. The movie doesn't really work. The dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream is just a way for him to cover his mistakes.This movie deserves a high 7 at best. In time, it will drop considerably on this site... perhaps to near #100. But that will only be due to Nolan fans. True movie buffs will never fall for this fantasy. It's ordinary storytelling and a ""make-it-up-as-you-go-along"" script.Go back to schools everyone. Stop doing drugs. This is not a fine wine... it is carbonated fruit punch. And your drooling all over your shirt!"
23250,True,"This movie is just disappointing and dreadfully bad. People are victims of the marketing campaign: ""this movie is complex, intellectual and multi-layered and if you don't understand it then you are stupid"". People don't like to be stupid and having seen that it's written, produced and directed by the same guy who did The Dark Knight they don't think anymore and go to see Inception.So, I will show you that Mr. Nolans movie is the opposition of ""complex and intelligent"": SUPERFICIAL. I have at least 6 arguments:1. The characters are just silhouettes, transparent and shallow. There is no psychological deepness; the protagonists are emotionless objects moved from place to place like chess figures. They don't have any soul. But what marked a movie is his developing of characters. Sure, you try to create something deep with the relationship between DiCaprio and Cotillard but it's just pathetic, amateurish and stereotypic. And then the kids' back that we see so often that it gets on the viewer's nerves.2. The music by Hans Zimmer is a torture. It's so loud and indifferent that your head is ringing at the end. 3. The dramaturgy is completely neglected. One destruction-scene follows the next; one pursuit-scene follows the next! And the end! What a big disaster: it's like in a video game, in an ego-shooter. It's so stupid. Almost propaganda for war.4. Then, Nolan will make this movie ""intelligent and complex"". Do you know M. Nolan that intellectual and deep does not mean emotionless and a confusing plot? 5. Nolans idea to enter in the dream of somebody else is not so bad but the idea is not exhausted. Dreams are imagination, there are no rules, and they are bizarre and strange (Have you ever seen a film by David Lynch Mr. Nolan? That is like a dream.). So what all the guys with guns are doing there? Why are there always skyscrapers or a military base? That's stupid. There is NO IMAGINATION, your dreams are copies of real life and they are even WORSE than reality. The only good thing is the sequence with the train.6. To select a well actor like Michael Caine for saying two lines is just embarrassing and disrespectful. Mr. Nolan is capable of making great movies (Memento, The Prestige) but this one is very, very poor.Your movie is not ""complex, intelligent and deep"" but just superficial and an insult for the reasonably carefully viewer."
23251,True,"Perusing the top 250, I was shocked to see this in the list, never mind so near to the top. I make no apology for admitting, that I fell asleep on numerous occasions (though kept re-winding). This is something I haven't done since Transformers (no re-winding),despite the thundering 5.1 soundtracks. Both these movies are style with no substance, but, back to this one.Has the need to appear intelligent by ""loving"" this film, so resulted in an ""Emporer's new clothes"" atmosphere? Can the slip-shod writing and drum-roll, sign-posted direction be so easily forgiven, in lieu of it's unique premise? (nobody mention The Matrix!)I hope this tumbles off the list as time passes, because it devalues some great picks and under-ground, high-points, that have already made it, thanks to some more discerning movie-goers."
23252,True,"The film is a disappointment, because it did so little with so much. Basically what you have here is a very interesting sci-fi heist premise; Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are partners who use dream-invasion technology to steal industrial secrets from unsuspecting mass transit passengers (why any powerful people in such a technological age would travel on mass transit, is just one of the many obvious questions the film expects us not to raise) while they doze. In exchange for immunity to a troubling criminal charge against Cobb, they agree to undertake an unprecedented mission: to practice ""inception"" on a powerful business scion, that is to plant an original idea in his subconscious through the dream manipulation.All of this is great, but unfortunately none of it has any emotional weight. To find that we have to look into the mystery of why Cobb has been in exile, and this plot has to do with his wife (Marion Cotillard) with whom he shared a disastrous and traumatic experience of dream sharing. This is to me where the movie essentially falls apart. It seems like Nolan and the other writers never fully synthesized these two dominant strains in the film, so that most of the time the emotional drama is just getting in the way of the heist film or vice a versa. At no point did it seem to me that the heist was complimenting the drama or vice a versa. And in fact after some very impressive effects sequences during the scenes where Cobb shows his new assistant Ariadne (Ellen Page, too green to hold up her role) a lot of the action becomes outright tedious, never more so than when we're ""treated"" to about a reel or ten minutes of numbing snow-mobile and gunfight action, right at the point where the film should be reaching a climax. It all starts to feel very obligatory, and Nolan is not a good enough action director to make empty content feel like fun.As a basic action/heist movie with sci-fi premise, it still works well enough that I would recommend it as a rental. Nolan works in some of the elements that have made some of his better films work on a higher level, such as the association with totems and icons (the spinning wheel, etc.) and the connection between memory or memory devices and identity. However when all the pieces are laid out, the film seems overly simple and mechanical. The plot is just this -- the guy takes a job, he does the job, he gets to re-unite with his kids. Although he constantly mopes about in a depression because he tried inception on his wife and she died, he has no ethical or moral problem with doing the same thing to Cillian Murphy's character, even though nobody knows the real consequences that could befall or the true motives of Ken Watanabe's character. I was hoping that some larger picture would emerge, but instead this film is politically naive and instead attempts to be dramatic. The constant shots of adorable children playing on the lawn made me feel I was watching a bad Spielberg film. The entire emotional anchor of the film is put on the shoulders of these cute kiddies in true Spielberg fashion. If you don't buy into this ridiculous soft-target hook, then the whole film collapses like DiCaprio's dream world.This isn't a bad or stupid film, but after a while you start to yearn for at least some human warmth or humor, which is almost always missing from Nolan's films. The characters are so sincere that it starts to become suffocating, especially considering how ridiculous the premise is when taken seriously. Basically this is like ""Total Recall"" in terms of ideas and in terms of stupid action scenes, except that it takes itself hugely seriously. It does not become a better film by doing so, nor a more intelligent one."
23253,True,"I sat in disbelief while watching this movie and when it had finnally finnished i registered to IMDb to slate this mess of a movie.i really cant be bothered going into the whole story etc because i'll be here all day.the main downfall of this movie is the Robert Fischer character,his subconscious was trying to defend the so called inception and what did he do? well he just imagined a few soldiers and a train to annoy dicaprio and the rest of the get along gang. BORING!!!! surely his mind could have thought of a few monsters or flying turds or anything other than what goes in normal every day life i mean it was meant to be a dream and uurrrgghhh i cant be arsed going on any more . why was there no drama or excitement to this film? why was this movie not like a dream at all? why did i actually sit thru this movie? why why why? Christopher Nolan and dicaprio i want my 148 minutes of wasted time back"
23254,True,"When a liquid is poured into a container, the liquid assumes the container's shape is a well known law of Phsyics. The underlying theme of this movie is Energy production. This story uses one's stages of dream states in individuals. Now comes Inception with its notion that it can change the liquid poured into the container, a chosen human target, thus altering that man's dreams and his consciousness for a desired outcome; A Dream within a Dream at deeper levels and stages of the human mind's dream states. This sums up the production of this nonsense spectacular special effects production, onward with baloney gibberish dialogs! It's ending is as pathetic as anyone could hope for! I felt disappointed with this movie, despite of the enormous efforts that were put into it by this production's Special Effects Unit who had copied and duplicated their special effects from ""Men in Black"" and from ""The Matrix."" All in all, this Sci-Fi story is an over publicized ESPIONAGE NONSENSE! I MEAN AN UTTER AND TOTAL NONSENSE!!"
23255,True,"some people, who liked that movie wrote that we all have to ""understand"" this movie to find it good and those who didn't, are rating it as awfulDAMN these inception lovers are wrong i understood this AWFUL movie, he (cobb) is a dream extractor who extracts the thought and other stuff of ppl and this time he has to put a thought in.....bla bla bla at the end (which is damn ****) he doesn't wake up from this dream zone(dunno the English word) and i ask myself : where the **** are the bad guys?? ahh there aren't any... what are you freaking kidding me??? its a dream so there is no need for bad guys... BAH i really was disappointed cause i expected some BAD GUYS and some more special effects CAUSE THEY WERE IN A ******* DREAM in other words the move is awful its waste of time and the money in to worth it"
23256,True,"well, well, well, oh hang on, I need another well......crap, crap, crap, and yes another crap......The concept of going in a dream and stealing or planting ideas is probably acceptable, even a dream within a dream is palatable, but hey guys - let's go to the third level and while we're there, let's try for the fourth as well - what a messy, badly scripted piece of junk. This movie is all over the place and whilst you can follow it with the concentration of a chess master, the plot and storyline is weak and rather pathetic. Wasted a lot of time watching this one, so do yourself a favour and go mow the lawn or something ! Save your money and wait for the DVD if you're curious."
23257,True,"I couldn't agree with Kimba more. There is nothing to this film other than the special effects and crappy action sequences. The obvious story line is just as simple as the story in the Matrix and was hijacked form the same philosophy books that have been around for thousands of years.What They Wanted You To See: The special effects are very well done but reminded me of when I was thirteen and learned how to bend corners in photo-shop, for the next three month any picture I created in photo-shop had all the corners bent, I was so excited to show off my newly acquired skill. Same thing with the special effects in this film. How many times do I need to see Gordon- Levitt running, fighting and falling against the walls and ceilings in the hotel room scene? How many times do I have to see the buildings crumble and the van falling in slow motion. I get it, I get it, they figured out how to do this and they are excited to show it off. Great special effects, I would have been in awe regardless of what the plot line was...Just for me the quality of a good movie is one which you enjoyed and would love to see again. Although this movie does inspire some non-independent thinking and conversation; what I am hearing about this film is that many walked out without understanding it, by their own admission, and have no intention of seeing it again. If I saw this movie being played on cable I would flip the channel so fast it would make my TV smoke. But with that said, this will be another cult movie with the same old cult following, bah bah...You Do Not See This Because You Are Not Aware That You Are Dreaming A Dream Within A Dream: Here is the great part. The movie has a secondary plot line. Forget the whole dream idea and whether he is or he is not in a dream and who's dream he is in and why the kids are in the precisely same position, age and outfits in the last scene as they are in DiCaprio's previous recollections. Apparently the character of Leonardo DiCaprio is based on Nolan; the director. The film is about making a movie. DiCaprio is the director, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the producer, Ellen Page is the screenwriter, Tom Hardy is the actor, Dileep Rao is the technical guy, Ken Watanabe is the money man behind the movie and Cillian Murphy is the audience.Do You Hear The Music?: The whole movie is explaining to the audience and the staff that you must create a semi believable world for the victim, the mark, the audience to be drawn in to. Its about scouting a location, creating a world and getting the audience lost in it, giving the director enough time to plant a non-original idea, such as, ""What a great movie this was!"" Anyone feel sorry for Cillian Murphy / Robert Fisher, Jr. because he was getting screwed with? well thats not Murphy that was getting screwed with, its all of us!Is Your Inner Ear Intact After All That Imax Noise, Because Here Comes Your Kick: According to DiCaprio's character or Nolan, If you alter the dream world too much, like Ellen Page did in DiCaprio's dream, the victim's/audience's subconscious will turn on you, realizing its fake/ a dream, and will turn on the manipulator of the dream, thus the screenwriter, director, etc. and become disengaged from the film/dream and wake-up, ""good afternoon, I am glad to see that you are awake.""Do You Remember Any Of It?: Do you remember when the original ""Architect"" gets killed off in the beginning? Well apparently it is very common in the movie industry to replace/remove the first screen writer. If you watch some of the interviews with DeCaprio he says that he is studying Noal for his character in the film, now you know why.Now, wipe off the morning-glory from your eyes and go outside and play."
23258,True,"Inception indeed has all the marks of a bad film. This is not just apparent in the film itself, but comments fan make.""If you don't like this movie, it's because you don't get it!"" ""If you don't like this movie, you lack class!""These sorts of things are the same things I hear when one of my hipster friends gives me a CD of some band nobody's heard of, and when I press Play, I immediately figure out why. When you like a movie that is identifiably bad, you have to come up with excuses for liking it that aren't tomfoolery, like ""you just don't get it, MAN. It's too ironic for your puritanical tastes!""In the end, I find that the film itself, fans aside, is not terribly thrilling. The ideas aren't originalit was like a Matrix in the dream world. Except a bad one, because nothing gets explained, really. Watching Inception was like watching the story of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 play out. The question I kept asking myself was ""okay, why is so-and-so doing THAT?"" At the end of the movie, I decided that Christopher Nolan, like George Lucas, is talented, but has gotten too full of himself. Why do I care about Cobb's kids, to whom we are granted no real introduction? Why do I care about dueling energy companies? Why do I care about a bunch of corporate hit men and mob bosses? There's no connection.An emotional connection is something lacking, but more frustratingly is the disappearance of character development about 15 minutes in. Everything gets lost at about that point actually. The logic of the plot, the coherence of the plot, everything. It's baffling to me. I loved The Dark Knight and The Prestigethey hit that sweet spot in between baffling and straightforward. Inception missed the mark horribly.SPOILERS DO NOT CROSSBy far, the ending is the most ridiculous. It's a contradictory ending. Although we see the top is clearly falling, and Cobb is not wearing his ring, the children look the same as they did.SPOILERS DO NOT CROSS"
23259,True,"I was on the verge of leaving the Cinema on this completely ridiculously story. I hung in there (also despite the insanely annoying music) though, and am simply shocked that the film has (currently) a top 3 position of movies ever made. Perhaps I have entered a (bad) dream and have not yet woken up...So the backdrop of the story is basically that a bunch of guys drug people and enter a dream world using a plastic box with wires attached to those entering the dream. In this dream they use the same technique (the box and drugs are now just apart of THIS dream..) to enter another dream. This process can be repeated a number of times - and in the movie they go to the fourth dream-layer. If you are killed while dreaming you will wake up - unless you are too heavily sedated (in real-life, or also in one of the dreams?..), which will then put you in a ""limbo"" state - which can potentially last for years. If you want to get out of a dream safely - you need to be ""kicked"" (sharp acceleration) in the dream-layer above the one you are currently in. If you are unsure if you are dreaming or not, you have a ""totem"" (a physical object that for some unspecified reason behaves differently in a dream - why?) that you can examine.I just hate it. Simply hate it...The only good thing I see in this movie is the ending: DiCaprio sees his kids again - but they look exactly as they have done in his dreams - they have not aged at all. This means that he is still dreaming and he is therefore stuck in a new limbo dream world - and will be there for a LONG time. Phew... that means there won't be a sequel until he wakes up again. Unless it is me that's still dreaming."
23260,True,"Terrible film. There are way better iterations of dream films than this. Mulholland Dr. by David Lynch is one of them.Like some others have posted around the web, it was too long, and too confusing. Not that there was any depth or cleverness to the film. Too much repetition. They kept 'trying' to explain everything over and over again. It was just a stream of Hollywood trash. Didn't really seem like any of the subjects were dreaming at all. Just explosions and dumb dialogue, with shallow characters and a convoluted storyline.SPOILER ALERT...The film is a film about a man, Leonardo... an Architect, who falls asleep on a plane in first class. It's a long flight to LA, so the movie shows what he is dreaming about during that time that he is asleep on that flight. The only real part of the film is when he wakes up at the end in the plane. He looks around, sees a cabin full of people in first class, then gets off the plane, and goes home with Michael Caine, either his father, grandfather, or caretaker for his two children.The people in first class were in his dream because he saw them in the cabin before he fell asleep. They then each took on a part in his dreaming, but none of them have any connection to his real life. And no, he is not a thief. He is not hired by some black corporation to extract information from people through dreaming. There is nothing of the sort. The movie is just a dream.Supporting evidence:1. First, the movie is just shallow trash. Horrible illustration of a dream film just down to its core. It's so bad that it is obvious how hard they tried to make it look like a dream.2. Reference to Architects... a dream architect is simply what Leonardo is in real life: an Architect.3. Projection... they must have said projection 100 times. It's obvious that the movie is telling you that Leonardo is just projecting his own subconscious onto the others in his dream. This is the only part of the movie that is decent academically. The fact that the filmmakers understand what psychological projection is. But also, the fact that they repeated the concept of projection so many times it just lost its value. Anyway, Leonardo projects his wants, fears, and desires, in a convoluted way, onto the other subjects. For example, ""Fischer"" takes on his own self in relation to his father. Also, the girl who keeps telling him to move on is another projection of his own mind telling himself to move on from his wife's death...The movie progresses and gets ever more deeper into Leonardo's subconscious, where the root of his anxiety resides. He finally discovers that it is OK for him to be his own man, to be an Architect, and not try to live up to what his father was. So we have a set of problem(s) that reveal themselves ever so slightly as the dream progresses, in the form of Leonardo projecting his fears, etc. onto other subjects, until he goes so deep as to arrive at a place where he has a feeling it is really about him. Like a sort of solution. But like anything, the problems need to be apparent before a solution can be revealed. Dreaming is like this. Your mind weaves together a series of experiences, and projections, and if you understand them enough, you'll know what the problems really are, and you can then begin working on a solution in real life...He then wakes up. Reality is there. It was a cathartic release.4. The dream sharing... there is no literal dream sharing, getting into the minds of others and extracting their thoughts. This is a metaphor... the movie is telling us that there are a group of people in a small area (cabin of a plane) who are all dreaming... and they may have a bit of a spiritual connection to each other... so one person feeling anxious, another may 'feel' this while dreaming and some sort of shared experience results. It's a bit of a play on the idea that people can dream together and sort of experience similar or even the same things. But that's pseudo-science and mostly fiction.5. Recurring nightmare about his wife. Obviously this is another clear marker that it is just a dream. His recurring nightmare about his wife. Looks like she killed herself, perhaps jumped out of a hotel room window because Leonardo didn't show up for their anniversary. Perhaps he was not a good husband and wasn't around enough... he then blamed himself. The girl in the film kept telling him to move on... So Leonardo's major life issues were revealed in a convoluted way within a long dream. Like any human being, those issues are complex. The ending showed how he seemed relieved when he got home to see his kids. It looks like it was a very important dream because it pushed him over a threshold and helped him to realize a set of things to make his life better.Also, can we please stop with all the discussion about the tenability of the things seen in the film? Most of it won't make much sense: it was just a dream. Therefore, defying gravity, ending up in different stages of life so quickly, etc.... it all makes sense when understood from the perspective that: it. was. just. a. dream. Now, after such a lengthy review and explanation, you might be wondering why I only gave it 1 star. I'll end how I started: it's Hollywood trash. Too basic. Too stupid. Too obvious. And to someone how dreams every night, and the fact that there are way better films about dreaming out there, there is nothing to see here..."
23261,True,"Around 750, the renowned poet of the Tang dynasty, Li Po, is supposed to have asked, ""Last night I dreamed I was a butterfly. Today, am I a butterfly dreaming I am a man?"" Marcus Aurelius, the late Roman emperor and philosopher, wrote, ""Life is a dream, a little more coherent than most."" Freud concluded that dreams were the fulfillment of unconscious wishes that had managed to sneak past the dozing censor. Aboriginal Australians believed in a real parallel universe called The Dream Time in which everything and everyone who ever existed, still existed, and anybody could enter this place during sleep.Modern psychology believes that dreams are nothing more than random cortical bombardment caused by a lot of activity in sub-cortical structures associated with the filing of memories, and the cortex goes into overdrive trying to make narrative sense of them. Sex dreams are pleasant enough except when the furry little animals show up, but statistics demonstrate that the majority of dreams are truly lousy, the kind we can easily live without. Don't you get tired of running in slow motion through a swamp while being chased by an ogre? Does all this sound like pointless rambling to you? Well, then you're not going to enjoy ""Inception"" because it meanders at lightning speed all over the place and lives by no rules that human beings have ever known.On the other hand, if you find these adventitious allusions in some way interesting, then you should see this dark and muddled movie. You get a bonus too, because in its style it closely resembles an action movie from the 1980s. Everything is happening all at once -- or maybe not all at once. Who cares? The point is that people get shot in the forehead and buildings comes toppling down for no reason and slow-motion explosions take place at irregular but short intervals.I'm getting pretty tired of seeing films that use some bewildering metaphysical scheme as an excuse to show off still more CGIs. I couldn't watch this thing through."
23262,True,"Don't get me wrong, Christopher Nolan (writer, producer and director of this movie) is a very, very talented filmmaker. He will undoubtedly make that masterpiece for which he will be remembered. But that's just my point: he hasn't made it yet. The Dark Knight wasn't it and Inception certainly isn't it. Inception is a product of a director who has been given carte blanche. His vision has been put on film without someone ever saying: 'Chris, that's not going to work.' For that matter, Inception should have been Nolan's Heaven's Gate. But Inception will probably make Nolan a even bigger star. He better check his totem I felt compelled to write a review when I found out this movie had a 9.2 rating and a 3rd place overall in the top 250. Let me say: that is ridiculous. To balance the scale, I have rated this movie (a ridiculous) 1. I agree with some posts on the message board of IMDb: complex does not mean intellectual or smart. And for that matter, I don't think this film is very complex. It just asks what most movies do: go with it.DiCaprio gives a pretty good performance (with leftovers from his role in Shutter Island) as Dobbs, a person who is able the penetrate someone's dream and see or steal his secrets. Recently Dobbs lost his wife and he has not seen his children in a long time. That is because the authorities think he has something to do with his wife's death. Watanabe gives Dobbs a chance to get his life back. He needs to plant an idea (inception) in the mind of a competitor. Like a seed, it will grow. And the inspiration for the idea will seem real.One of the problems for me with the movie was that the dreamworld felt pretty flat and boring to me. Unlike The Matrix (a inception for this movie), the inhabitants of the other world do not bend the rules of gravity. The laws of physics do apply. That's not a bad decision. But I agree with one reviewer: 'Nolan's dreamworld looks like a mediocre action film from the 90's.' The bad guys walk around like video game characters with an AI set on level Easy. I almost shouted in the theater when Eames went Rambo in the snow scene. I understand the decision. Look at The Cell to see how wrong you can go if you explore the subconscious on film. But still, for me his decision to keep the dreamworld neat and clean is a cop out. Dreams don't look like this. Hopes, fears and experiences mix with (the conception of) the real world and you get a pretty original result sometimes. None of this in Inception. Oh right, the architect is in control. How convenient The whole dream within a dream concept was a little far-fetched for me. Have you ever had one? Probably not. So why, when you have a pretty basic dreamworld go with a concept this unreal? The real world does influence the dream the character's have. But they feel it and are conscious that it is the real world. That's a missed opportunity. A dream influenced by factor's unknown to the dreamer could have made it much more enjoyable for the audience.Maybe it's just not my cup of tea. Like Nolan's former projects The Prestige and The Dark Knight: I don't get all the hoopla. Yes, these movies (like Inception) are well made. They are original, have refreshing ideas, are technically good and have decent scripts. But they are not the best of the decade. And this one really is not a 9.2. I'd say a 5.5. Barely..."
23263,True,"I purchased this movie on bluray because it was on #6 so I purchased it for 200 Kr which is approximately 38$. I guess I expected a very entertaining movie. but then I began to watch it I was disappointed it was just too slow. I couldn't watch more than halve an hour. Next day I tried to watch it again and made it trough another have hour. I had payed money for it so I wanted to see it. third time I made it through the movie.the theme about dreaming is interesting enough,but they try to long to explain what was going on. Imho it was kind of self explained.I felt nothing for the characters.the plot doesn't get interesting or I didn't get the plot.there is no humour in the movie, they take themselfes to seriously."
23264,True,"At one point Cobb tells us that despite his best efforts, he cannot create a dream wife with the depth and complexity of his real wife. Could this be Nolan's own subconscious, commenting on his own limitations as a writer and director?Cobb undertakes to plant an idea in someone's head so that Cobb's employer can monopolize an industry. Cobb succeeds, and thereby recovers his own life. No one in the film questions the morality of this; the film doesn't really question the morality of this, or invite the viewer to do so. Apparently, it's just business. Although in a way that is often thin, banal, or hypocritical, usually the sentiments offered to us in movies managed to stay aligned with basic ideas of good and evil. Not in the case of Inception. The popularity of this movie is a little frightening."
23265,True,"Well, I have to agree with this site, which came up when I was searching for Inception: ""Inception' wins informal poll as most overrated movie of 2010."" I just don't get it. This is what I saw (fortunately for only $4.99 on On Demand):Great special effects, but mostly in the beginning of the movie. An interesting psychological plot about manipulating a guy's mind. An incredibly long middle sequence where one guy is moving around unconscious bodies, interspersed with equally incredibly boring scenes of shooting and fighting on a mountain - why in the world was all that necessary? Without the hour or more spent on this totally unnecessary footage, it would be have been a much better movie. We almost killed ourselves when they showed the first shot of the van and it had JUST started falling. I guess the director took the idea of 5 minutes real time/1 hour dream time painfully literally. A plot with a guy and his wife that is (SPOILER ALERT) totally predictable if you saw Shutter Island or Memento, or took Psych 101. A cast that acted reasonably well, but whose characters I didn't care at all about.So I don't get why it's so popular. I think I would have liked it a lot more if it had been ruthlessly edited down to an hour and a half, and if the wife plot had been something different for a change. I'm getting tired of that one.I know I'll get a lot of screaming comments from fans who don't believe anyone should have a different opinion than they do, but I'd like to see anyone justify that long middle sequence."
23266,True,"I do not understand why this movie is so over rated. I seriously thought what in the world is this movie trying to say. Are they saying you can actually control actions in a dream and not only that, you can even collaborate with other people in that dream and better still dream again in a dream and then if you aren't satisfied then dream one more time. Now that's hilarious. They might have proved one thing they are saying which is planting an idea in minds. I think the movie plants and idea that you can dream on whatever you want and looks like they done a good job in that. People actually liked this movie. whao!"
23267,True,"So, it's all a dream.When in high school, I remember one of our English teachers putting a ban on essays that turn out to be a dream. His argument was that one could just write all sorts of nonsense and take the easy way out by revealing at the end that it was a dream.Overlong seemingly pointless car chases and gun battles... Plenty of these in re-runs of the A-Team...All this messing about in the hotel, fighting guards, tying up bodies and moving them around. These guys aren't very creative / resourceful in their dreams, are they? However attractive Marion Cotillard is, the sub plot became very irritating indeed. The grenade launcher should have been used on her early in the dream! As for the end, an easy cop out: it's a dream, folks.I won't go into the cgi / scenery designs. There was stuff just as good in computer games designed for the Amiga and Atari.There was great potential, but this movie is a mess."
23268,True,"After reading all the amazing reviews and seeing a score of 9.3...3rd best movie of all time, I had to go watch Inception. Also I really like Memento...it was such a cool, original movie..so I was looking forward to this.I went to see this movie last weekend. It was an 11:00pm showing on Sunday night, 3 weeks after opening night and the theatre was packed! We had to sit in the second row...something I don't mind at all.Epic Fail The movie is about corporate (not even government) spies, that enter people's dreams through some unexplained technology. Once in the dream, they trick the victim into giving up his/her secrets. Pretty simple premise, and one that can be taken into many directions (after all we're in dreamland). Well the direction is down the crapper.The whole premise of the movie is so shallow, Saito, a corporate CEO hires Cobb (Leo) to go into another CEO's dream and plant an idea of breaking up his fathers empire (upon his father's death), so that Saito can have a monopoly. How's that for a story?? What a joke.Well the movie starts slow and drags on and on, besides that there are so many plot holes and explaining of everything that happens..like they manipulate the victim by having a dream, within a dream, within a dream. When you are falling in the first dream, the second layer has no gravity, but the third and forth layer has gravity?? WHAAAA??? Also even though you are in a dream, you have no super powers..you use boring guns? How about shooting lighting bolts out your you know what?? BOOORRING.To add to the boredom, Cobb's wife Mal killed herself because she thought she was dreaming. And appears regularly to bore us to death, you get the sense that she's supposed to be evil, but it never pans out.This was interesting on one level only...there was no antagonist. But then again there was no love interest either, and on top of that no danger, cause if you get killed in a dream, all you do is wake up.This movie is amoral tripe with no imagination..eg. you are in a dream world, instead of driving around in a VAN, why not fly? Instead of shooting guns, why not freeze them in their tracks? Also, there are many people (I assume teenagers) who are saying how original this movie is. The Dream within a Dream thing has been done before...it's called ""A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 3: Dream Warriors""..also don't EVER compare this tripe to the ""Matrix"". Matrix was original, it was filled with clever allegory, it was truly awe inspiring, but there was NOTHING clever about Inceptipon.The climax was okay, but just because after 2 hours I couldn't wait to get out of there.Now the anti-climax, is an entirely different animal, like the viewer hasn't been insulted enough...we are left to ponder weather it was ""all a dream"" (again not very original). The answer is yes, it was all a dream, and Cobb is still in a dream..his kids look exactly the same, even wearing the same clothes as his other dreams.Please do yourself a favour and do not pay to see this garbage. So far the best movie this summer has been Predators...how sad. People think this movie is clever and original because they are teenagers..it probably is clever and original to them, but any adult will find this movie dull and boring. Inception = Fail IMDb for having Inception in your top 3 movies = EPIC FAIL.If I was the credibility Nazi, I'd say to IMDb ""NO CREDIBILITY FOR YOU!""2/10 for exploiting a big budget."
23269,True,"I can't believe this movie is voted #4 best movie, this movie start with such an interesting topic and I truly hoped for a amazing, sophisticated and well executed movie but...,the story could be sublime however the execution is just clumsy, the director tried too hard and wanted the movie to be big. But beside dreams, this movie is nothing but a collage of scenes with major capitol cities; crime involves rich person dying; repetitive, half ass architectural and interior designs, and of course, endless people and car chasing plus everlasting fights..this movie is a combo of many movies, you don't need to see this movie if you have seen some of the followings: 80's James Bonds, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Memento, butterfly effect, Ronin, the day after tomorrow (another really lousy movie)..., the worst thing is many scenes in Inception are quite directly replicated from those movies.the art design of the movie is terrible, I can see the art director only knows M.C. Escher and may consult some mediocre architects, I highly recommend he or she to try some acid or just simply ask people about how their dreams are like.by the way, in the theater seeing this movie, I felt annoyed every time when i see a logo, especially seeing the logo of Hyundai a thousand times, I started thinking about how much money Hyundai endorse and forgot the car chasing is still going on! Also I keep wondering about this: considering 5 minutes equal one hour per layer of a dream, do those people feel thirsty or wanting to go to the bathroom in their 50 year long dreams?For people saying that we should have some imagination to appreciate this movie, I truly believe that these people are just finding excuses for this movie and for themselves too. sorry I just can't stare at a pile of crap and imagine that's filet mignon :p"
23270,True,"Inception: the story of corporate agents who trap their mark in an engineered ""dream world"" that's oddly dreary yet deafening, populated with nasty soulless projections, in which minutes seem like hours or decades, all just to rob the mark - and just when it feels the nightmare's about to end, you just find yourself in a nightmare within the nightmare. This pretty much sums up the audience experience.I found Inception uninteresting, too long, and absolute work to watch. While the premise was great, and the plot at least interesting, the writing, plot sequence, and execution were poor. And even the cinematography was greatly disappointing. You'd think a deliberately constructed dream world would be fantastic - it was merely drear, deafeningly loud, bland, stark, and depressing - even when it was monumental, it had a decidedly Stalinist architectural quality. I realize that people (supposedly) dream in black-n-white ... but did they have to make almost everything grey and dingy? Virtually all of the ""fantastic"" clips shown in the trailers happen in the first 30 minutes. In the great (70+ minute) finale the only visually interesting and original bit is the 0-gravity fight-scene as the hall tumbles around them.The climax seemed interminable, but ceased to be suspenseful about 10 minutes in. All the supporting cast - with the arguable exception of Caine - were complete ciphers, mere 2-dimensional shadows you couldn't give a damn about. The descent into dream Limbo to rescue their employer made no sense given what was explained about the nature of dream invasions: just whose dream were they entering? It was not DiCaprio's character's, so why are they stuck in his deep subconscious? ... unless of course it was all really just his nightmare to begin with.In the end, the whole movie only makes sense if it really is all the main-character's unending nightmare. Unfortunately, it proved a nightmare for me. I know thousands of brain-dead, hype-fed, viewers who imagine themselves intelligent and deep, felt differently. But my actual nightmares are more interesting, less painful to endure, and considerably cheaper."
23271,True,"The 150 minutes in the theater seemed like 1500 minutes.Great idea. Good visuals. Horrible production. After all, what was I watching? Whom I liked? Who was the bad guy? Why were things happening on the screen? And, why for so long? That last never-ending sequence on ice. Had no idea who was doing what and why.I did understand the concept as I was prepared for it after hearing from so many people about the 'complex' script. But to me, it was plain stupid. The producers had money and wanted to use it in action sequence and special effects. Did those fit the plot? Not really. This movie didn't need much action, to be honest. The movie should have stimulated our brains, not ear drums.Anyway I went because of the hype. Should have known better. But then, it was a dollar theater and Sunday night when Texas Rangers and Steelers both were losing. So, it was OK."
23272,True,"I was really looking forward to watching this movie after all the positive reviews, the incredibly high IMDb rating and the raving of several friends who had seen it.I will point out that I liked The Matrix, Memento, Batman Begins and the Dark Knight (although this last movie is quite overrated on IMDb). I also understood the plot of Inception from the start and never had any trouble following what was happening so it's not that I didn't ""get it"".Inception is NOT a great movie and not even a very good one. The plot is not very clever or inventive contrary to what many IMDb raters have suggested and there are no interesting or surprising twists. The characters are poorly developed and, as the viewer, I didn't really care what happened to them. There are no true ""bad guys"" to root against (all the bad guys are just ""bad"" dreams) and there is no real desire to see the ""good guys"" succeed because the object of the entire plot seems irrelevant (implant a thought in some guy's head so he will break up his father's corporation... I kid you not!). The fact that everything happens in dreams removes the sense of danger and risk from all the action and makes it seem like a pointless video game, which is what several of the dreams appear to be anyway... unimaginative and repetitive. Are all Nolan's dreams just ""shoot'em up"" video games? The attack of the hospital/mountain fortress was as bad as it gets... looked like a CGI sequence from Medal of Honor/Call of Duty.It was also infuriating to me that the rules of the dream universes are inconsistent. Creating an imaginary situation where normal rules don't apply is OK as long as the alternate universe functions according to logical rules, but in this movie the rules are constantly bent to accommodate the needs of the director.A few examples: The top is supposed to be an indication to Mal that she is in ""her own dream"" if the top spins forever because she has made it that way... If she is in someone else's dream then the top will topple since they don't know that in her dreams the top spins forever. So how does that indicate to Dom/the viewer that he is/is not in a dream/reality in the end scene?... but wow, that is sooo deep.How did finding the top in the safe allow Dom to ""incept"" Mal with the idea that she was in a dream and needed to return to reality? No explanation... but wow, that is sooo deep.In dream No.1 the van falls off the bridge causing weightlessness in dream No.2 - meaning that non-physical events (it's a dream) of a certain kind(?) carry through between dream layers. In dream No.2 the sleeping characters become weightless but somehow this state does not carry through to layer No.3 and No.4... but it's a dream anyway so who cares if it makes sense?Why do you need a ""kick"" in each layer to wake up the characters? if weightlessness carries through the layers the ""kick"" would logically also carry through... If there was some logic to the rule wouldn't it be that only actual physical events in the real world carry through to the dreams? But in your dream you are aware that there is another reality - which is really another dream - so you dream that can feel the effects of the other dream although you are asleep and unaware of what's going on... but wow, that is sooo deep.If a character is asleep in the first layer of a dream he does not know what is happening to him after he has fallen asleep thus would have no reason to dream that he is becoming weightless in layer two as he sleeps through the falling van dream... but wow, that is sooo deep.Since the wake-up ""kicks"" are supposed to come through sensation in the inner ear and the ""kicks"" are not real but dreams, then I have to conclude that the inner ear must ""dream"" that it senses the imaginary kicks, which makes no sense at all... but wow, that is sooo deep. So as you analyze the logic behind the dream rules you must conclude that the entire movie is just a dream (a nightmare) where no logic applies or that the ""dream rules"" are just nonsense and the whole movie is a pretext for stringing together a bunch of unrelated ""cool"" action sequences and special effects to make a massive Hollywood ""pseudo-intellectual"" blockbuster junk movie. This movie was an even the greater disappointment considering that I was anticipating something better than ""The Matrix"" or ""The Sixth Sense"". The IMDb rating of 9+ is incomprehensible, this should rate in the 6.0-7.0 range. The rating must reflect a large number of users getting confused and rating it as a video game.As for those who say the number of positive votes/reviews indicate it is a great movie I think you could likewise argue for McDonald's being the best food in the world.I rated it a very harsh 1.0 only to help bring the IMDb rating back to earth. It is however a very mediocre movie."
23273,True,"Inception is an interesting movie without a doubt (refer to one of the countless other reviews for why that is). What I am going to focus on is why I think it's not a 9/10 which is what the IMDb voters on average have given it. I will also make the presumption you have seen the movie, as it's not productive to repeat the plot. The second reason is because a fair amount of time has gone since I saw the movie (twice), and although that means I've had lots of time to think it through, I don't remember all the details.First, let me state the most immediate reason to why I didn't like the movie that much: The second half of the movie is a long string of bog standard action sequences. Yes, it's trying to be tense, but it doesn't manage to surprise me one bit - the ending is nearly completely predictable. Throughout, I care about only a few of the characters, and about none of the endless imaginary minions they are facing. If this fairly large flaw had been absent, the movie would at least have been a 9/10 for me.Now for the more subtle problems: I feel that not enough was done to emphasize that the mission takes place in a dream world. Most of the time, the movie's ""dream"" world is indistinguishable to the real world. This similarity is intended (it is argued that the dreamer otherwise would become suspicious and wake up, or reject inception). Unfortunately, it means there are few chances to surprise us... That's where we return to ""bog standard action sequences"": Sure there are a few cool twists that illustrate the characters are in a dream, like the city being turned upside down; but these devices are for the most part absent once the inception mission starts, and thus have minor impact in total.Obviously, this movie defies all physical laws, which would be okay if there is an alternative set of rules to cover for reality. It doesn't have such a coherent rule set however; instead, it is mostly reminiscent of movies where anything convenient is made up for whatever is supposed to be happening on screen. The bad guys perform wildly differently depending on whether the protagonists are supposed to be able to escape or not, rules for various dream levels diverge too much, and so on. In short, the script fails to lend itself credibility - one cannot simply say ""it's a dream, we don't have to care about plausibility"".Aside from more than a few inconsistencies and 'too implausible to be believable'-facts, is is noticeable the background story/universe is mostly invented from scratch for this film. Perhaps it would have benefited Inception if a clearer connection to some existing religious or other fantasy theme had been made. We can only speculate for now, but I do hope someone decides to make another movie with the ""entering dreams of others"" theme with stronger ties to some existing mythology.All in all, these complaints are pretty minor (except for the aforementioned way Inception attempts too much to be an action/thriller movie towards the latter parts). I'm giving it 7/10, since it made me stare at my watch several times to determine when I would no longer have to endure more clinical action sequences without substance."
23274,True,"This show is excellent. No doubt about it. But so much of this show is an absolute rip off from the anime movie Paprika by Satoshi Kon. As much as I would like this show if it wasn't for not having seen Paprika first, the only problem is, I have.It ain't exactly the same. But I felt its close enough. Implanting a memory through a dream, that's the exact same premise of both stories.For anyone who has seen Paprika, you may find an awful lot of similarities here and it is truly showing that America needs to find something better to do than copy other people's works.Nevertheless, besides my cynical behaviour, I applaud this series for what it has managed to achieve to do, as it has one of the greatest fan bases a modern movie can ask for and I still don't feel that it is overrated. I just feel that it was far too similar to Paprika."
23275,True,"The reality is that my summary basically sums up this movie. It has you questioning reality all the way through; in some ways similar to The Matrix, I suppose, although it's more obvious in this movie that there's questioning about reality to be done. This movie, however, lacks the philosophical/religious elements that The Matrix had, and stands as a pretty formulaic action type movie with the issues about reality thrown in.Essentially, this movie takes place within a dream - or within dreams to be more precise. That's the catch. Leonardo DiCaprio as Cobb plays a man who has somehow figured out not only how to get into people's dreams but how to link various people into the same dream, so that the dream becomes reality. Some tragedy has befallen Cobb as a result of this, which is finally revealed, but it does take a while. Cobb and his team are hired by a Japanese businessman who wants them to get inside the dreams of one of his corporate rivals to convince him to break his company up, thus eliminating the rivalry. The move goes from there.It's a confusing movie. There aren't just two layers to it - reality and dream. There are actually multiple layers of various kinds of reality, as characters can enter into dreams within dreams, each successive layer becoming more and more removed from what reality really is - if you get the point. It's imaginative, but it is confusing as you try to sort the layers out. In all honesty, it's not a movie that especially appealed to me. DiCaprio's performance was good but nothing more and there were some really good special effects included in this. Aside from the dream inside a dream inside a dream gimmick, though, this stacks up as an action movie among action movies, and I didn't find it an especially noteworthy addition to the genre. A friend told me it's the sort of movie you have to watch 2 or 3 times to really get your head around it. I think I have a reasonable enough attention span, and if I can't get my head around a movie on the first watching, then it's unlikely I'm going to go back to it again. I will say that this is the sort of movie that's tailor made to produce sequels. The very last scene leaves everything wide open to continue exploring whether or not Cobb is actually back in reality. (Remember, the top was still spinning on the table as the last scene faded out.) The possibilities for sequels are virtually limitless. Everything is based on a dream or dreams. You could have anything from comedy to action to historical epic to outer space adventure and it would all make sense, because it's all a dream or dreams! Still, while I can have some appreciation for the ingenuity of the writers to come up with a story that has the potential to literally go on forever, I didn't find enough here to make me want to look at the inevitable sequels."
23276,True,"Dumb! Dumb! Dumb! was that enough DUMS! for you to make you feel sure this is the greatest film of the 21st century, Christpher Nolan's multi-layered visionary masterpiece? No? Dumb! Dumb! Dumb! Come ON! Surely that must be enough DUMS! for you to realise that you're witnessing a tour de force from a director at the pinnacle of his genius? It's a film of transcendent majesty! A mind blowing spectacle utterly thrilling to the senses and deeply fulfilling to the intellect! And if you're not convinced of this, I can do what Christopher Nolan does, and just keep going Dumb! Dumb! Dumb! until you are! It's a trick that seems to have worked on most people as they wander out of the cinema like wide eyed happy zombies, eager to write their adoring review on IMDb and give praise to Christopher Nolan who has now basically attained to them the status of God, but it doesn't work on me. I don't know why, but for some reason the idea that this film is a mesmeric piece of shimmering cinematic brilliance hasn't been 'incepted' into my mind.Actually I do know why. It's because it isn't a mesmeric piece of shimmering cinematic brilliance it's two and a half hours of sheer unadulterated boredom. There's no character development. The drama is unengaging. The action sequences are bizarrely devoid of tension. It's uninvolving. The characters waffle on and I don't care what they're saying. The gunfight sequences are tedious. The enemy characters frequently fire bursts of rounds but never manage to hit anyone despite ample opportunities. How many times does Nolan think it's a great idea to show a character floating around in a hotel corridor while fighting 'projections'? And someone please tell him that he can't prove to the world he's made the best film ever by going Dumb! Dumb! Dumb! over and over again. Except apparently he can.The basic idea has the potential to make the stunning film so many people think it is, but Nolan wastes the opportunity with a dull storyline. Getting a business man to split up his company? Is that the most exciting thing he could think of? Couldn't he get a president to decide to launch a nuclear attack or something? Did it have to be something so mundane? And he weighs down the film with an abundance of under developed material and fails to create any sense of danger in the fights.Why does everyone think this film is SO good? People don't seem to be able to tell the difference between a film that tries to be fantastic but fails, and a film that is fantastic.Good things? yes it's had a lot of money spent on it. There are some striking images. Ellen Page is super pretty...erm..."
23277,True,"I really do not have anything new to add here. The negative reviews already posted say it all. If you thought this movie was good, you probably did not get it at all. If you know it sucked, then you understood it perfectly well. This was the biggest waste of time since Leonard part 6. Just because you are in a dream in a dream in a dream in a dream, that alone does not in any way make a movie complicated or good. Well crap, it says the review has to be ten lines or more, so here it goes. I have used this website for a long time and this is the first review i have ever done. The reason i felt so compelled in doing so is seeing how highly rated this stupid movie is. If you loved this movie for its ""complex storyline,"" go ahead, turn on spike TV and wait for wwe wrestle mania to come on and write me a gushing 10 star review about the complex storyline and the butt kicking inside a butt kicking inside a butt kicking inside a butt kicking."
23278,True,"I will start by saying that Inception does indeed have a clever premise, or at least one that sounds good on paper: A group of people who steal information from people's dreams are hired to put an idea in someone's head. Cobb's back story and the way he was haunted by his mental image of his ex-wife was genuinely fascinating. However, all of these nice, fresh ideas are lost in a hurricane of absolutely awful and pretentious storytelling. People have often praised this film for having clever writing, but it strikes me that the film is just deliberately trying to be needlessly complicated to appear smarter than it really is. I say ""needlessly"" because, when you get right down to it, the overall plot of Inception is not all that complex, so the film just comes across as pretentious.One of the first problems I had with the film is something I thought was present in Christopher Nolan's Batman films to a lesser extent (but those films had the benefit of having straightforward story lines and memorable characters): We are presented to a concept that could never happen in real life. That's not the problem. The problem is that the film delivers its ludicrous plot in such a straight-faced dead serious manner that it breaks my willing suspension of disbelief. In a film that took itself slightly less seriously, I might not wonder as much about where the technology to travel into someone's dreams came from, but here, it just begs for an explanation. If the film weren't trying to have a realistic atmosphere, I might buy that you can do this by injecting chemicals into your arm, then dream up more chemicals to travel into dreams within dreams, but here, it just comes across as absolute nonsense.None of the characters in the film, with the possible exceptions of Cobb, Mal and Fischer, were interesting or memorable in the least. In fact, most of the characters don't really even feel like people as much as they feel like soulless chess pieces that exist only for the purpose of advancing the plot. As a result of this, I could not have cared less about what was happening in the film, and towards the action sequences at the end, I was on the verge of falling asleep. I'm sorry, but watching people with no personalities battling generic gun wielding masses (who, in a stunning lack of originality, are apparently supposed to represent Fischer's subconscious) just isn't entertaining.Bottom line, Inception is a boring, pretentious and rather nonsensical film. It has a nice premise that sounds good on paper, which is why I really expected to like it, but found it a letdown."
23279,True,"This movie does not come close to Matrix I. It is sad that this is ranked so highly in the IMDb list.This simply is an action movie. A decent one, maybe, but there are so many movies like this, really. Perhaps one difference is that this movie has some philosophical side to it (albeit junior high school level, ""what if all of this is a dream?"" type). I wonder why the thousands of viewers who gave a 10 to this movie liked this movie so much. Are those guys all from the UK :) ?! I was also bothered by the multitude of inconsistencies in the movie. For example, the husband and wife spend 50 years in the dream, which means that they must be in a third or higher level dream, which should require according to the movie a heavy chemical that prevents waking up from it in case of death. But they commit suicide and that wakes them up instead of sending them to Limbo, as we are later told in the movie should be the case when that kind of drug is used. As another example, the lack of gravity is felt in the first level of dream, but not in the second level when the van is falling off."
23280,True,"This movie was terrible. It tried to be something ground breaking and emotionally challenging, but fell terribly short on all fronts, starting with the basic premise. I am expected to believe that a group of people smart enough to construct an elaborate plot involving breaking into other people's dreams are not smart enough to reunite a man with his family without getting stopped at customs? That's stupid. Fly to Mexico and walk. Or fly the kids to you. This giant plot hole is unfathomably stupid, as is most of the dialogue in this two and a half hour nightmare. I think my personal favorite line in the movie was when DiCaprio's character told his dream wife that he could not do her justice because he could not remember all of her perfections and all of her imperfections. You can't have both stupid. This movie is probably mindblowingly deep and meaningful if your education stopped in grade school, but if you have a least a GED, don't waste your ten bucks."
23281,True,"I can't believe I wasted 6 dollars to see this movie at the theater. It was a waste of 2 hours and 20 minutes. I don't know why this movie got so much praise, it's a pointless sci-fi movie that should have gone straight to video. I see some reviews say this movie was better than Star Wars, you have got to be kidding. Unlike Inception Star Wars had a great story, the actors even though unknown at the time impressed me; and the special effects-WOW. I must say Star Wars blows Inception out of the water still to this day. To anyone who doesn't think so must be too young to know that it took a lot more effort in the 70's to make a great film. I was really disappointed in Inception, I thought since Nolan did The Dark Knight movies this would be another success. This movie was slow, boring and really had no plot. The only thing I took from it was it was a dreams and getting into peoples heads in there most vulnerable time while they are dreaming. The ending was a WTF ending the kind that can make or break movies, but since this on was broken from the start the ending really didn't surprise me. To all who want to see a great sci-fi movie pick up the classic, like Alein, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Equilibrium, ETC.. I know from watching these movies and being a big fan of the SW saga, you won't be disappointed. Hey BTW, looking for a great TV Mini-series blockbuster from the 80's checkout V and V-The Final Battle, these movies are classics and I would recommend them to anyone who likes a great sci-fi movie.THX, Kris L. CocKayne"
23282,True,"As if we hadn't already enough with all the ""masterpieces"" coming out of Hollywood and some other places--Donnie Darko, ESOTSM, Stalker, Irreversiblenow we got to deal also with the even worse ""life--changing"" movies, like Fight Club for ex. Inception falls also in that category, even if it isn't nearly as bad as FC. Well, no other flick could be that bad. But the main problem with Inception is that it makes for an unfulfilled promise, which has angered many of its would-be fans; and they have retaliated in kind. After giving a glance at the Hate Its I can see that many reviewers give it a 1/10 just to bring down its rating to ""a more realistic level"". I have never seen people doing that, being more interested in bringing down an average rating rather than in showcasing their own. That means that Nolan has angered and disappointed many would-be fans.Now, what has disappointed many is, I guess, that the premise on which the story is built is dripping with potential, yet a potential that remains practically unfulfilled. I would even call such premise the equivalent, in the world of dreams, of Fantastic Voyage, the classic of the 60s. The journey they made there into Man's physical anatomy, Inception could have made it into his innermost world, down the inner reaches of the subconscious mind, that region of the human psyche where dreams are built and from where they are projected outwards. Such a modernist epic was what Nolan had in his hands when he started his project and yet he managed to ruin it, or at least bring it down to the level of the mundane, of puerile Hollywood-style entertainment, that one made of shootings, bombings, car chases.The plot is that simple: a trip into the mind of a man to plant an idea in it; but not even that simplicity keeps it out of trouble. Now, Nolan shouldn't go around telling people it took him ten years to come out with this plot because it doesn't reflect well on his scriptwriting abilities, specially when it would have been very easy to fix its weak points, above all the stated motive for the journey--to crown rich man Saito Energy King of the World(!). Rather than that it would have been better for Saito to come up with a more altruistic motive and then, at the end, bring some unexpected twist. Nolan should have seen The Professionals before finishing his plot. Here a team is hired by a Texas tycoon to bring his Mexican wife back after she was kidnapped by a Mexican bandit and taken to Mexico. But after the men have accomplish their task they realize they have been had; what they have done is really taken again hostage an escaped woman who had fled back to Mexico into the arms of her lover. That's a good twist. Furthermore Nolan didn't even need Saito; any government brass could have taken his role with far more authority and credibility.But all that's relative as (Spoiler) the whole movie is a dream. It's all happening in Cobbs' head. The dead giveaway is the kids seen always at a same age, with the same clothing and in the same posture, as if they were just a video playing in Cobbs' head. Do they exist? Who knows. Does Mal exist, or existed? Who knows. And who are the people who were with him in the plane; are they real persons, shadows in his mind? Most probably the later. (BTW, Mal's suicide scene is a dream sequence, not a lucid recollection: she has opened the room's window and levitated to the other building). But if the whole flick is a dream that's an even better reason not to be sloppy in the writing because the better, more logical, the plot is, the more we see it as belonging to reality and the more shocked we'll be when the truth comes out. That is not happening here, for several reasons, of which we can list a few.First, as said, the motive for the operation is lame. Even lamer is the ""emotional climax"" between both Fischers, father and son. That would have been touching if we had cared about them. Then there's the lack of interesting characters. That they are unlikable is the least of the problems, a bigger one being that they show no development at all. Page is far too young for her role and the Cobbs/Mal love story loses its punch if you don't care about them. But even worse, the flick carries no tension at all; the members of the team are risking nothing except an ugly awakening. And there are no fundamental differences between levels, no dream atmosphere either. Those levels are simple carbon copies of our physical world, only difference being that you can play tricks and Matrix-like gimmicks in them. There are many rip-offs also. Some are obvious, as those from Bond flicks of the 80s, from Matrix, Dark City and so on. I'm maybe the only one to mention it but I see also shades of Mallory--Guns Of Navarone--in those pep talks by Cobbs to the team.But the most serious charge you can make against Inception is its that is inconsequential, it lacks originality. It doesn't bring you anything new; it's all deja vu from beginning to end. It could be good enough for a 5; just like, say, a mildly entertaining match of ping pong; but just as such match, you'll forget it sooner than you can imagine."
23283,True,"A competent movie that somehow has gotten a ridiculous amount of praise. I felt just about everything in this movie was average, but I am sick of being berated for refusing to say this movie is anything less than perfect. A decent premise, well acted, but long and slow. Unfortunately this movie is riddled with mistakes and the subplot with the wife could have been so much more interesting than her barely getting a look in. Some good moments, but not enough to make it as long as it was for me.Also, was it just me, or were the kids the same age at the end of film? If so then doesn't this mean that the is he in a dream or not ending (which I saw coming as soon as they introduced the spinning top by the way) is pointless as if the kids haven't aged, it must be a dream.Don't believe the hype!"
23284,True,"""What's the most resilient parasite? An idea. A single idea from the human mind can build cities. An idea can transform the world and rewrite all the rules. Which is why I have to steal it."" That is the motto of ""Inception"". It is a very intriguing idea in itself, but one which the film only goes superficially to explore. To cover for this superficiality, the plot is given a superficially complex guise, but actually it's pretty straightforward.Leonardo DiCaprio and his team invade people's dreams to steal information from their subconscious. However, their new mission in ""Inception"" is not to steal information, bur rather to ""plant"" it, therefore causing the inception of a new idea in the target's subconscious. To do this, they form dreams within dreams (which in the film actually work as three separate dreams rather than actual dreams within dreams), therefore accessing a more vulnerable form of the target's subconscious.For some reason (which the film doesn't adequately explain) within the dream there is a symbol of the subconscious motive (say, a safe) whereas you can find the desired information, or whereas you can plant the desired information. But there's a catch. If for some reason you ""die"" in a dream within a dream, you remain in subconscious limbo (which again is not adequately explained) which nevertheless can resemble a form of reality in itself.Amidst all that, Christopher Nolan makes an action film, with car chases, gunshots etc etc.Here is the thing with Nolan. As a director he only offers intrigue. He approaches an ambitious idea, touches the surface of it, but then hesitates to proceed any further, and reverts to the action film prototype. Furthermore, he has done it so many times already, that even the action segments look pompous and clichéd (too much reliance on editing and warping of real time).This is a confused film, which tries to hide it's inadequacies in a needlessly confusing plot.Once again with a Nolan film, ambiguity prevails. When DiCaprio and his wife are stuck in subconscious limbo, the wife ""locks"" the idea of doubting an objective reality, and throws away the key. DiCaprio invades her subconscious and replants the idea, thus when they re-enter real life the idea remains. But the idea was there in the first place, wasn't it? The sub-plot with Robert Fischer is stated in such a way so that it impresses with it's artificial ""complexity"" (in the first ""layer"" of dream, DiCaprio's team plant seeds of doubt; in the second layer of dream they direct Fischer into facing this doubt; and in the third layer of dream he faces it, duh), but it is suggested that the seeds of Fischer's discomfort were already rooted in real life, with DiCaprio's team merely fast-forwarding them (hence ambiguity again). The icing on the cake is we never learn whether DiCaprio has returned to real life or not (ambiguity).What a mess. The only thing this multiple dream architecture serves is that it spices up what is essentially a simple plot: that somebody enters someone's dream in order to plant an idea. That's all there is to it.As it is, ambiguity characterizes Christopher Nolan very nicely, as he seems eternally torn between the commercial action film and.. something else (without that ""something else"" ever taking shape). Nolan must stop hinting at a grander scope and actually embrace it."
23285,True,"**Only a very teeny spoiler** Well, what can I say? Inception was the most overrated movie I've seen in years. The plot had more holes than a string vest.I found the first 20 mins dull at best, and was easily distracted (I actually paused the film and ordered a pizza/had a look at Twitter/read another message board...). I even restarted the film to give it another chance, but to no avail.Then for a whole 20 mins, it managed to keep my attention before leaving me again thinking 'why I am watching this?' for the next hour or so. I finally gave in with 45 mins to go when it turned into a Bond movie with snow skiing chases that appeared from nowhere.I didn't give a toss about the characters who did nothing to make me want to care, the plot didn't fill more than a few minutes of the 145 mins I stayed with it and bar a few nice CGI tricks - I can't say there was anything not done better in other movies many times over and in a great deal less time.Give me Total Recall for dream based plots and action any day of the week.The acting was average, the architect looked 17yrs old yet somehow became an instant expert in dreams/psychology and managed to be smug - was she the token precocious child that all writers include when their stories are dying on the page? Perhaps a cute pet dog would have helped here.It isn't often that I switch a film off because I think its pointless to carry on. Inception didn't even annoy me enough to see what happened at the end - I simply didn't care. How this is getting anything over a 6/10 is beyond me. I gave it a 4/10 and even then I think I'm being generous - it didn't even score on the So Bad It's Good chart."
23286,True,"Inception - I saw this a while ago. I only write about it, because South Park was making fun of it last night. I never got the enthusiasm for this flick. It was somewhat entertaining, although, certainly not mind blowing or even that inventive. I've seen more mind bending things on the Outer Limits from the 60's. It was not memorable. In fact, I had forgotten about it until last night. One of the things I remember was how poorly Ellen Page's character was rounded out. I remember laughing, not at her - but at the part she had to play, Ms. Exposition. Explain everything to her, so the audience knows what is going on. The action was cliché, and left me wanting more. The whole thing about going into someone's dream is so silly, but not funny silly - which leads me to...South Park, on the other hand. Was a lot more fun. Throw in a Sheep Herder, a young Mr. Mackey, a random pizza delivery guy, and even a retired Freddy Kruger and you've got an entertaining 22 minutes. And, of course, Randy Marsh. Stan is trapped in Mr. Mackey's dream, so Randy goes in to save him. Stan sees his dad in the dream. But his dad has come into the dream as a Butterfly. Stan says ""Did you come here to help me?"" and Randy replies ""I was gonna...Butterflies have no concern for these things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterfly poon."" So much better than watching inception."
23287,True,"I have been reading nothing but good reviews on Inception these past few weeks, now I knew from the minute I saw the trailer, I had to see this movie but I didn't know what to expect. If you have seen the trailer to this movie, you know that it doesn't explain too much. But I saw Inception today and all I can say is: Wow! With an incredible cast and amazing director, you just can't go wrong. Inception is a movie that not only makes you think but can start a whole conversation with what you just saw on the screen. It's a very clever story that is told with skill and passion, while you do have to pay attention, I loved that it made me think. One of my friends saw a premiere and told me how he would have to see it again to understand it, but I didn't get that when I saw it today. But I would love to see the movie again, I have no problem with that. Between the performances, the story, the sounds, the editing and the incredible effects, I would love to watch this movie over and over again, it's my favorite film of the year so far.Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobbs rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible inception. He gathers a group of thieves that will pull this incredible mission off, teaching new comer, Ariadne their amazing world and how to alter it to their liking, but if gone too deep into making the dream into something strange, they could get lost and play limbo between reality and dreams. Even after all the lessons, instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one.To write a dream is a riddle, I love the way this movie was written. Christopher Nolan is one of my new favorite directors, he knows exactly how to write and tell a story. The only small flaw, this is a very small complaint, is that his stories while they're incredible, can also be a bit exhausting. This film is a bit long to warn you in advance, it's a little over two and a half hours long. I felt like there were a couple of things with the story that could have been trimmed, but like I said it's such a small complaint because Inception intrigued me so much. To say that this film will be a contender for the Oscars is pretty much a guarantee with the sound, script, editing and effects. Hopefully I think it might be a runner up for best picture.One of the things I hate to do in a review is brag about a movie because I don't want others to get over hyped with the film and to be disappointed when they see it. But honestly, I don't think there isn't one person I wouldn't recommend this movie too. Inception has some of the most incredible effects mixing The Matrix and The Dark Knight, I think the ""Zero Gravity"" fight scene is one of the most amazing moments I've seen on the big screen. I loved how the story kept you thinking and going, guessing what would happen next and what was going on. A dream within a dream within a dream, you even begin to question with the characters what is a dream and what is reality. With a great cast and excellent director, Inception is everything I wanted and more, once again, Nolan created a masterpiece. Something from his own mind, Inception questions yours' and makes you wonder which world you are part of.10/10"
23288,True,"Its all flash and little substance in Christopher Nolan's over long story of people able to go into the dreams of others.I'm not going to go into the plot, partly to play fair with those of you who haven't see the film, but Nolan has constructed a film so needlessly messy that its damn near impossible to summarize simply.Yes the visuals are spectacular, though most of them are obviously CGI creations. There are also fewer than you would think since the dream weavers of the story have to keep thing real in order to achieve their ends.For me the story isn't much of anything,certainly not enough to support a two and a half hour tale. The deepness of Nolan's ""philosophy"" is also over done, and ultimately meaningless since Nolan is on record as saying it's all been made up and exists purely to drive his plot.I like the story I just wish it didn't take so long to get where it was going.I also hate that Nolan changes the rules about half way in as a means of making things more exciting. Its not fair and I was so annoyed I walked out of the theater the first time I saw the film.Good not great, its worth a look see down the road."
23289,True,"Everyone has been telling me how this movie is so complex, so confusing. That you really need to pay attention or you'll get lost.I dosed off in the middle and still knew exactly what was happening.This movie is nothing but a cross between The Matix, Dreamscape, Mission Impossible and about 3 other movies and anime films that have been coming out since the mid 1980's. The ending was the most obvious outcome it could be, you already know he doesn't except the dream version of his wife so she would be gone. But the kidsgetting home to see their faces again, they were the real focus. If you missed that in the beginning then seeing his father-in-law pick him up at the airport should have been the final tip off.Most people I ask about that missed it all; they couldn't even tell which dream was which. I think that's what scares me the most, people think this takes real intelligence to follow.Maybe if your attention deficitOh wait I am and I still had no trouble following this over rated boring movie.I gave this movie 4 out of 10 stars for special effects only, for story line and acting I give it only 2 stars"
23290,True,"The fact that 37,000+ persons voted this silly movie a ""10"" is either ""studio feed"" or proof as to why our country has gone to the dogs these past 18 months.The movie lasts 2 1/2 hours but the plot can be told in one sentence: A man seeks to reconcile to the memory of his dead wife. What we get is over two hours of pointless explosions, false and silly action scenes including having a freight train plunge down a city street. There are a few human interactions, but these don't much matter. All this is underlined by the unoriginal use of loud and intense background music (heavy on drums) giving the erroneous impression that something important is happening. Environmentalists (the real ones, not the lefty nit-wits) might be annoyed that Lloyd drops hundreds of millions of tons of collapsed buildings debris into the ocean -- for no better reason than a brat destroying a sand castle.As for the dream scenes: Wes Craven simply owns this with his brilliant ""Nightmare on Elm Sreet."" Craven obviously had first hand personal torment and he understood nightmares, whereas Christopher Nolan might have never been asleep, for all he knows.The few good points were DeCaprio, Ellen Page, Michael Caine, and a few good international locales.On second thought I doubt there were 37,000 nit-wits who loved this movie. The pattern is familiar. A well-hyped Warner Brothers movie starts getting 10-ratings from the first minute. Studios have been purchasing rave reviews from media critics for decades, surely they's continue doing so and corrupt this website. IMDb has no controls to prevent fraud. There was no trace of enthusiasm among the crowd tonight, just a dazed look of What Was That?"
23291,True,"I found Inception to consist mostly of drawn out, overblown idiotic chases and shootouts. Mostly boring and some hilariously so.I found the floating, gravity defying scenes downright silly. Especially funny was when the 'Arthur' character stacked and tied up the rest of the sleeping crew in the hotel and floated them around.This film was a good 30-45 minutes too long in that respect. Way too much time spend on chasesThis whole idea of 'is this a dream or reality' thing is as old as the hills, even though I do in fact subscribe to many variants of the idea as part of my own philosophy. It doesn't, or shouldn't come off as some really 'deep thought' of a movie to most people. Unless, the genius lies in whether or not the poor film goer can follow the action or not.I just happen to think the movie was a cheap cgi infested shoot em up wrapped in a cynically presented metaphysical wrapper.Personally I enjoyed ""The Nines"" much much better in terms of this whole 'what is reality' movie theme."
23292,True,"Inception is a sign of the times.It is the Google-Twitter-FourSquare-iPhone apps version of a movie.It is a smart idea. It is an idea that manipulates and seduces the masses. It is all about the execution. But ultimately, it is an idea with no heart.It's hard to care for the premise. In these days of BP, do we really care for an energy company vs another energy company? It's even harder to care for the characters. There isn't a Danny Oceanesque easy charm when the team is assembled. There is no single character in the team who we can gravitate towards. And the whole longing father routine doesn't really work.At least The Matrix (first movie) had a heartfelt resolution - that love is the answer. Inception...it's just cold. Clever, but cold.Gimme Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind with its tech-with-human-touch idea of pitting memories against the power of love anytime."
23293,True,"I don't actually consider this to be an awful film but felt that a note of restraint should be applied to the gushing superlatives thus far enjoyed by a film that simply doesn't deserve them.It is a decent story reasonably well told. The direction is intelligent but probably led by the nose by a script that more or less demands sensational action sequences and often contrived drama and emotion.Leonardo DiCaprio coasts through the film with a perfunctory performance which left me caring little about his character. The supporting cast, again, perform well enough but do nothing out of the ordinary.The special effects are spectacular and beautifully choreographed but one can't help feeling that this is why many younger reviewers were seduced so successfully.It is a good film and certainly entertaining but, at times, it was muddled and from time to time one couldn't help thinking, 'why don't they just use hypnosis' or some other suggestive technique. It seemed to be a long way to a short cut.I am perhaps being churlish in that respect since one ought to suspend belief to a degree when watching this sort of simplistic, banal sci fi fairy tale. One reviewer reckoned that this was up there with 'The French Connection' or 'The Godfather'. It is a long, long way short of that."
23294,True,"Like we had the Coen's love in, we now have the Nolan love in.This movie is in the TOP 11 movies of all time according to the masses.To be fair, I loved Nolan's 'Memento' and 'The Prestige'. I settled down to watch this in great anticipation. IMDb had it at NO.1 at the time. Better than Shawshank? Godfather? This must be something else!I can only sum this movie up in sentence.They make it up as they go along. Really. The way the 'plot' needs to be continually explained by characters is a give away. This guy's dream affects this guy but the surroundings are made by this dude this totem will work here and....come on guys. This is ridiculous. Yes, it's Sci-Fi but good vs evil on another world is more believable than this.Utterly disappointed with this movie. Get a grip fanboys. This is a movie about some dudes dreams.You can easily (as I did) tear this 'plot' to pieces in minutes. He wants to go and see his kids. He can't leave the country.Are we agreed that that's the plot?Couldn't the kids have flown out to him?Now who's the one who doesn't get it?If you've got ADHD or similar you may like it. My cat likes it when you dangle a shiny toy in front of him. He liked Inception."
23295,True,"The movie is a cascade of factual errors and logical errors. The very foundation of the movie is so totally wrong and mistaken, that the movie makes no sense at all.Nolan should have done some research on ""Lucid Dreaming"" to get his facts straight. Reading only one book would have sufficed (Lucid Dreaming, by Steven Laberge).Were other movies brilliantly succeed (Dreamscape, Matrix, Existenz and possibly others), Inception miserably fails...For people who know very little about dreaming, this movie may seem great, but for those who do, this movie is a joke. Really too bad, I just can't understand how writers / directors can totally ruin potentially great ideas and concepts."
23296,True,"Inception is the kind of stupid plot an overexcited child might have come up with. Nolan seems to have become so caught up with his own brilliance of questioning reality and dreams he's forgotten to come up with anything resembling a plausible plot. Inception is drivel. It pretends it has hidden depths and meaning by using the most convoluted plot I've seen in a film for years. It's banal, intellectually dull, and unimaginative, with not one character worth caring about. Half way through writing the plot Nolan mus have suddenly realised that if it's a dream then no-one is actually in any real danger  hence he comes up with limbo! It's like you can see him scratching his head as he realises no threat = no tension. Thus we have LIMBO!At least when Christopher Smith made the much better film - Triangle - he realised (and openly admitted) that these kind of plots are likely to get out of control BUT he also realised you can still allow people to enjoy the ride if you care about the characters and there is tension and something at stake. But with Inception there is no tension, excitement, there is no-one to care about. For Nolan's sake I hope one of his films bombs soon because that's the only thing that's going to wake him up. He used to make interesting films."
23297,True,"Inception is, simply, overrated. It defies the long standing approach of show don't tell; of course it must tell, otherwise, the viewer would be even more lost. And of course, when it comes to action, it is all show just like any good action movie. In fact, Inception is nothing but an action movie wrapped in some philosophical stuff about dreams. There is, of course, real ingenuity in some of the action scenes especially those place in a zero gravity situation. Nolan was simply lucky in having an action movie released during a time when there wasn't really much competition and audiences were clearly hungry for something better. Nolan was even luckier having Hans Zimmer for Mr. Zimmer keeps suspense alive during the many long scenes of exposition. The real theatrical breakthrough lies in the film's using the telling part (hugely aided by Hans' music) to sustain interest and some suspense which are then fulfilled in the showing part. It is quite amazing that the film did so well at the BO; there are really no characters to sympathize with or to particularly care about. As to plot, the payoff for the many pangs of Cobb's conscience is indeed worthwhile. While many seem to think the film will have considerable longevity, it will fade quite quickly when considered outside of its lucky time slot."
23298,True,"OK, I just joined the fun. Did not know I have to fill in at least 10 lines, well so be it then. I just wanted to drag the movie down a bit since it is quite crappy. Surprisingly just a few days ago I watched the imaginarium of Dr. Panassus. How Surprising? They are both comparable, they both suck big time. They both have mediocre ideas which could have been turned into a decent movie and both failed. And actually how does a Kreisel that just keeps on spinning when you imagine it do so when you are in a dream helps you to distinguish between dream and reality when you imagine your dream to be reality and you therefore can not imagine the Kreisel to keep on spinning for that is not possible in reality? And how come you exist in three different dream levels and the time is managed in the way the director invented it, how good timing then that you wake up in all three levels at precisely the same point of time, I mean that is fine planning if you ask me. But then, being able to be shot at for a felt 20 minutes while sitting in van and not being hit seems also unlikely. So maybe they did dream it all up to be precisely the way it went. I guess then the Japanese guy was not to good at dreaming, stupid dream tourists. All in all I did like something about the movie (therefore 3 stars) but I do not remember what it was."
23299,True,"I am from Argentina so my writing may contain a lot of spelling mistakes. Sorry for that.I saw this movie a couple of nights ago. I checked this web page as I usually do when i go to the cinema. 9.1, #4 movie in the whole history and a plot which contains different worlds with different rules seemed pretty interesting.3 Minutes of Movie were enough to realize that this was a typically popcorn movie with not much to learn about. Dialogues are stupid during the whole 2 hours and a half. The 3 or 4 excellent ideas that Nolan had for this movie, were constantly explained by the actors. Characters are simply Hollywood stars repeating clichés dialogues, with no background or description at all.On top of that, the movie constantly uses the Hollywood resource of using fire, explosion, shootings, fire arms, persecution, repeatedly. I find that extremely boring, but especially in this movie. Those short shots of gun firing and explosion going on, were simply ridiculous. A Guy firing at a Van which is at 1 meter of distance and missing several shots, is unbelievable.I believe the plot, and the main idea of the movie are really interesting and original. A world within a world is a fun plot. A Dream World with different rules seems really interesting and fun. I believe that this movie had a lot of potential, but it the end it resulted in another cliché movie from Hollywood.If you are looking for an action movie with excellent special effects, Inception is definitely a fine movie. If what you are trying to watch is a movie with a philosophical plot, with captious dialogues and intriguing sub-plots, re-watch The Matrix or Blade Runner."
23300,True,"L.Di Caprio would just need to realize there was no reason for him not to go to USA over to his kids, because he didn't kill the woman in the first place and he was just imagining people thought he did or that police was after him or not letting him into the country. must be a very good father to help one multi-corporation boss take over other guys business in order to go back to kids, he could have visited anyway if someone would have made him clear he is just a little bit retarded. oh gosh, and this Japanese guy (since he can just like that buy an airport etc.) could have also payed to kill this son of the other boss or whatever. stupid enough, this Japanese multimillionaire even motivates this young guy to make his own business. i mean, the guy can buy airport and he still wants more. why is the so called best architecture student in Paris even interested in working with these retarded people? money? and the other two guys.. i guess they are just tired to live in that Aladin-looking street in Mombasa drinking magical potions. what a bunch of losers. maybe the movie is trying to say, non of this movie makes sense in any way, because it is all happening in this limbo. if this is directors limbo, i understand why he added this annoying suspense soundtrack, three special effect and 400 guys with guns running around like someone would have filled their heads with air. i guess air in the most audiences heads is the only thing holding this movie from drowning.i try to lean back on my chair, to wake up from this reality, where a crap movie like that can get movie prizes and people actually find it intelligent. this plot is something that a 14 years old kid with a bit of imagination could have written. i really don't understand how something that shallow and idiotic can make so much money and get so many attention. no wonder we live in a world that often feels as idiotic as this movie.you call a crazy guy coming home to his kids after this obviously unsuccessful helping-a-big-company-to-gain-monopole therapy a happy and? it is just incredible what kind of rubbish people actually buy. it is very sad."
23301,True,"""The Emperor's New Clothes"" is a short tale by Hans Christian Andersen about two weavers who promise an Emperor a new suit of clothes that are invisible to those unfit for their positions, stupid, or incompetent. When the Emperor parades before his subjects in his new clothes, a child cries out, ""But he isn't wearing anything at all!"" Personally, I find this movie an utter waste of time and recourses.Am I the child in the above-mentioned tale? Am I not intellectual enough to understand this marvelous gem: Inception? Or perhaps the majority of the users on this forum are scared of submitting negative reviews, for they might be regarded by others as stupid for not being able to comprehend the intellectualism in this movie.PS: I watched this movie in two parts (for it is long and boring) and I managed to fell asleep on both occasions."
23302,True,"This movie is completely overrated. Just because they's going into people's dreams does not make this film intelligent, and it does not compensate for the bad plot and underdeveloped characters. I found myself just wanting it to be over an hour into it. I had no problem understanding the concept, i just thought it was nothing exceptional. Let's not only enter one dream but enter three! It was completely ridiculous. I realize that it was a movie and they don't necessarily have to be realistic but i think the idea to enter three dreams was just a sad attempt to make the movie have more depth and fake complexity. This film easily could have been shortened down if it didn't have the unnecessary dragged out gun fights. When ever a new gun fight came up i would grown knowing i'd have to sit and watch it for another twenty minutes or so. They never developed the characters to make you feel bad for them if they died or got hurt. I even thought while watching how much i wouldn't care if they got stuck in the dream forever and went into limbo or whatever, as long as it ends soon and i can leave! I would never have thought that if they would have made the characters relatable and not so indulgent. The movie itself took itself a little too seriously also. I got a vibe the whole time just with the over dramatic music and over the top effects that the people who made it obviously thought too highly of it which i never find appealing. The only reason i give this movie any stars at all is for the cinematography and acting. Otherwise this movie is just an overrated indulgent film that is just pitiful attempt to call a 9/10 star movie. Pathetic."
23303,True,"This is a totally incomprehensible movie. Unlike other jigsaw puzzle movies of today this one doesn't come together at all. There is no excitement since you can't understand what is going on anyway. There is no emotional connection with the characters since its just a mess. One scene just moves to another without any explanation or logic. I concentrated as hard as I could and it didn't make any sense at all. Even if I watched it another 3 times I still wouldn't understand it.Ellen Page looks like she was plucked from Junior high and thrust in the middle of the Matrix. Cotillard is out of place too. Even Leonardo and Gordon Levitt don't seem enthusiastic at all. Don't waste your time just because Leonardo is in it. This is his worst movie ever. This may be one of the worst movies ever period. You don't learn anything, feel entertained, laugh, cry or feel any excitement at all. The only things you feel are bewilderment and confusion and frustration. The praise - its just the Emperor's new clothes. The box office? Just the blind leading the blind."
23304,True,"Went to see it today and came out of the cinema very disappointed, borderline angry... I have to admit though that my expectations were too big for what is after all just another summer blockbuster. First the story, you'd call it original if someone like Philip K Dick had never existed. Thing is, he really existed (we could question that after all, that would probably please both Dick and Nolan... Sigh)and he wrote dozens of books on the subject, which makes this movie anything but original storytelling wise. Also the movie is far too long, they should have cut off at least 30-45 minutes, almost fell asleep at the 1h30 point. The scenario is not even well thought, sometimes even incoherent and the director tries to hide its weaknesses with lots SFX and gunshots. I'm especially thinking about the last ""jump"" to go to the limbos, it's not the 4th level as there's no 4th level in the architect plans, the limbos, as previously told during the movie, is the place you end up in when you die in the dream and can't wake up in real life, so why is it suddenly possible for them to get there without dying ? (and don't serve me the ""they go in Cobb's mind"" crap, i don't buy it) Good points in the movie : SFX (i loved Paris folding on itself) Cast (thank god there were good actors in that movie...)All in all not such a bad movie, but certainly not a masterpiece of sheer originality. 5/10 would be my note if it wasn't so over-hyped, I chose to give 3/10 to strike back on the sheep giving it a ten when it certainly does not deserve it AT ALL."
23305,True,"This film was supposed to knock my socks off! Well, I'm still wearing them, because this film was such a disappointment. I thought 'Memento' was brilliant, but 'Dark Knight' a con, although this was supposed to be a total Nolan film. It should have been his 'Heaven's Gate' ( a much better film by the way) but it has proved almost 'Titanic' (again a much better film). Indeed, the audience left the cinema asking each other 'did you enjoy it?' as if they thought it was rubbish, but had to find out whether it was OK to say it was! It was.Let's face it, the plot is little more than a pretend heist movie on a par with 'Ocean's 12.' But it is hidden away in a complicated story of dreams and dreamworlds - three levels worth with each level allowing more time in it compared to reality! Gottit? You should do because Di Caprio spends acres of screen time explaining it to the complete and utter boredom of the audience. Cinema, Doctor K - I think not. It all boils down to finding out why the hero's wife died and how are the gang going to plant an idea in the head of a major industrialist (eg Inception). Following this? As the climax boils (in an extremely prosaic dreamworld hardly worth the effort and CGI) on three different levels - one a minibus falling off a bridge (interminably in slow motion), the second Tom Hardy's screen test for the remake of 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' complete with ski shooters, Blofeld's alpine fortress, and an enemy that cannot kill a hero from five yards!, and the third, a legoland where Di Caprio's wife is skulking siren-like to lure him to stay forever - the film really creaks and shows its' paucity of vision, script, characters, and downright boringness! I have to excuse some of it because I needed the loo and could not get out of my row! Yes, I had a totem which kept me firmly in reality ( I knew how long we had to go by how far the minibus had to fall!).And the plot holes - many, but the worst involved the Cillian Murphy getting killed in the second level which should have left him in mindless limbo on level 3, but he was dead there as well, while Ken Watanabe who died in level 2, became a very old man in level 3!!!! And right at the end, Cillian Murphy has been trained to resist dream thieves, and when he wakes up, he finds himself in the cabin with the gang but does not put two and two together and realise they are the real thieves having persuaded him in his dream otherwise!! Gettit? Don't bother, it was probably all Di Caprio's dream anyway - a load of old tosh that has Nolan laughing all the way to the bank, and many so-called serious critics facing the sack for lavishly overpraising a piece of mediocre tosh!!!"
23306,True,"*MAJOR SPOILER ALERT* The biggest problem with Inception was that I had no incentive to care about any of the characters or what happened to them. Other then built in pathos (dead wife guilt issues? Check. Daddy issues? Check? Missing your family? Check) there was no real drama or tension to the piece. At the end I really didn't think for more than 2 seconds about whether the totem tipped or not. Because it made no difference one way or the other. I was in no way invested in Leo's character.Another disturbing part of the film for me was the notion that even given the damage caused by Leo's character's first use of inception (on his wife) he was perfectly willing to do it again. I found all of the characters morally repugnant and was rooting for them to fail. Problematic as well is the attempt by the film maker to introduce stakes for actions only to immediately blot them out. At one point someone asks Leo if killing the baddies is damaging the psyche of the subject. A simple ""no"" suffices and it is never brought up again. For what reason was it even brought up then?The film also doesn't bear up to scrutiny. The world of Inception didn't play by its own rules and as a result all the wind came out of the film's sails. During the van chase there was tension, if they crash they will be kicked out of the deeper layers. Then the van DOES crash (with lots of rolling/tipping) and this isn't a kick? It took all the tension out of later scenes. Also when the target gets shot, which up to that point was presented as lights out Leo spouts one line of expository dialogue and everything isn't kaput? We aren't very far from Captain Kirk suggesting a tachyon pulse.The most glaring fault, however, was that despite how it was couched in terms of psychology and mental representation, the producers and director clearly had the Sparknotes on Freud and the publishers blurb on Lacan. Even an action-schlock genre film like Avatar had more psychological content than this ""thriller."" Inception is a bloated mass of CGI and MacGuffins with nothing to say and nothing for me to care about."
23307,True,"Sci-fi films are loved all around the world these days. 'The Matrix', 'Donnie Darko' and my personal favorite 'Brazil'. But here comes another film by director Christopher Nolan who finished 'The Dark Knight' 2 years ago and now is ready to do another movie. The critics and the audiences loved it. While I consider it as the worst Christopher Nolan film ever. And here's why.Now I must say that I don't think this is horrible. There are quite a lot of good things in this movie. First of all, the special effects are amazing. There's this scene where the other side of the street starts to bend and it meets the other side of the street. Cars are driving upside down and all those crazy things are happening. It was awesome. Second, the music is ground-breaking. There's always this big boom that comes out in the movie and it just makes your heart rattle. Third, the premise is brilliant. The idea of going into a dream and stealing somebody's thought is a premise that only Christopher Nolan can write. It is amazing at those points and I could've liked it.But there is one big problem I had with this movie. And that was the acting. The acting was horribely bland. It has no taste and I just think that the acting starts to get boring. Leonardo Dicaprio's acting has hardened as time went by. He was amazing in one of his first movies 'What's Eating gilbert grape' which is one of my favorite movies of all times. And of course I had a problem with Ellen Page who I thought was so good at acting after I watched 'Juno'. But no, she is so boring in this movie too. The characters doesn't help much. There is not a bit of character development is this movie. And I want good characters when I watch a movie.On the whole, I don't think this movie is terrible. It has its bad and good. I think he should go back to this days of 'The Dark Knight'. I know a lot of people loves this movie but for me, it's the worst Christopher Nolan film ever. But it's worth a watch if you know what a good movie is. I give it 6/10!"
23308,True,"First off, it's clear that these IMDb ratings are no longer valid. This film was just 'ok' by anyone's standards, except maybe the plethora of teenagers that love anything that includes lots of gun fire and 'splosions. The plot was unnecessarily convoluted and chock full of lazy writing. I have really liked Chris Nolan's work, so this is not a personal attack on him; it's just nowhere near as slick as others have claimed. The biggest symptoms of lazy writing are: constant exposition in the guise of conversation, constant changing of rules set up earlier in the movie and supposedly brilliant people making illogical choices, when the plot demands it. Many have said that those of us who didn't like it were just clueless and didn't ""get it"". What's to get? The plot was not difficult to understand, just difficult to accept as anything that made any sense. A dream with a dream within a dream. Big effing deal! I bought this film on DVD and couldn't wait to see it as so many people had hailed it as the best thing since Citizen Kane. I was left feeling empty and ripped off, then again, there is an entire generation that claims ""Transformers"" and ""Independence Day"" are two of the best films ever made. I fail to understand how this over-blown, over-hyped film could garner such high ratings unless the people doing the rating have never seen a movie over 20 ears old. The concept was high-minded but the execution was pure popcorn-munching tripe. While I'll admit the cinematography was gorgeous and the acting was fairly well done, it was just so empty. As others have pointed out, when it's all just a dream, there's not a lot of tension when faceless people are shooting at you. Just plain silly, I say. (as an aside, South Park did a very funny dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream years ago!)"
23309,True,"I wasn't really impressed.the special effects (as usual) are good. The acting was good. The story/plot was OK.So to dream of a reality is an so-so movie, and a dream within a dream is an OK-good movie but a dream within a dream within a dream... is a great movie??C'mon, it's just layers. Add a couple more 'dreams within dreams' and that makes a blockbuster? it's an onion. You keep peeling away layers and all your left with IS layers. That's all this movie was - Layers. I mean it's been done before, but with more layers and more FX. I did like the fact Cobb and his wife had lived a whole life, growing old, but that was a different layer/dream. ( Somewhat like Star Trek TNG's The Inner Light). But this reminded me too much of Vanilla Sky's idea of Being in a dream and it being like a reality. Just add more layers and special effects, and you've got Inception.OK, whatever. I Just wasn't that impressed. I thought the Matrix idea was better."
23310,True,"Not many movies rate a 9/10, especially when averaged over almost a quarter of a million votes. So - devoted Sci-fi freak that I am (and being so often disappointed by cheap SF offerings), I was sure I was on a winner.However after viewing the movie last night, I found it confusing and inconclusive. I understand the basic concept, that by entering a person's subconscious, it might be possible to steal or implant information / thoughts, without the subject later being aware - ""It was all a dream"".However in the main phase of the movie, where Cobb (DiCaprio) is tasked by Saito (Watanabe) with implanting Fischer (Murphy) with an idea which will neutralise his rival, the end of the matter seems to be that Fischer, who always thought his Dad regarded his as a loser (""a disappointment"") in fact simply wanted him to be himself i.e. to realise his own potential. Surely this would be empowering rather than diminishing or defeating, as Saito wanted.The intrusion of Dom's wife Mal and kids into many scenes was an excessive distraction which seemed to get the movie too far from what was supposed to be happening. Interesting idea, that they'd already spent some 50 years together in a deep dream layer .. but a bit too far-fetched. Real dreamstates are certainly tinged with reality, but not the concrete reality expressed in the movie. Only when Dom enters his own world towards the end of the movie, do we see skyscrapers which look like plain cardboard boxes. It would have been unacceptable to audiences if the ""dream invaders"" had entered a more cloudy reality (the old idea of Heaven) as is commonly experienced in dreams.I notice many reviewers who gave the movie a 9 or 10/10 say it must be viewed multiple times in order to be fully understood. Is this really the mark of a good movie these days, it must be studied like a high school text? I greatly prefer Spielberg's method of storytelling - complex and very entertaining but comprehensible in one sitting.And what's with all the gunfire? I understand that subjects can be psychologically prepared to resist extraction or perhaps implantation, but much of the gunplay seemed gratuitous, simply there for audiences expected as some sort of crowd-pleaser.The CGI and cinematography is first rate, but nothing really compensates if the basic story is not comprehensible.Well it's a movie I will certainly keep in my SF collection, and no doubt I will watch it at least once more to try and see what others find so appealing. 6/10"
23311,True,"I have rarely hated a movie more while I was watching it than this one, especially because I expected it to be very good to great. Despite an abundance of arresting visuals and and some good performances (especially by Madeline Cotillard), which save it from a really low rating, it is a bad movie in many ways. It is unbearably talky, overcomplicated, pretentious and boring. The last hour cycles the same four scenes over and over, and the only sign the movie is moving toward resolution is that the van the dreaming characters are riding in falls five feet closer to the river at each cycle. By then I was drifting in and out of consciousness like the characters. The film score pounds at you with incessant Teutonic heaviness. The main character is so thinly characterized that you have little reason to root for him. I like Leo much better when he plays a character in reality and stays out of dreams."
23312,True,"This review is not so much a review but rather an attempt to understand the threads of the movie. It is by no means authoritative and all encompassing.The movie lays out many clues for the viewer. Particularly the notion that an ""idea"" is the most insidious infection. Once an idea has taken root only death can provide a release. Furthermore, some people's realities eventually become a state of constant dreaming. Thus, it is possible for someone to constantly require to dream in order to maintain their grasp on reality.The next premise that we are introduced to is the notion that ""ideas"" can be taken from the mind. From that we are introduced to the notion of ""inception,"" or the planting of an idea in the mind. The reason that inception is so difficult is because every idea that the mind has can be traced back to the source. So for most of us, ideas in our head can be traced to someone or something (a speech, a book, a movie...). Powerful ideas are self-created ideas, they can change the world (the movie explores this quite nicely).The movie takes place in the dream world and in reality. At the end of the movie it seems that Cobb is still in the dream world. But how can that be, he is reunited with his children? My thoughts: 1) We know that Cobb and his wife Mal had managed to get stuck in the final phase of dreaming--pure subconscious. It was in this place that they built a life together of reconstructed memories. Unfortunately over time Cobb had enough and wanted out. Mal did not believe that they were living in a lie.2) Cobb, in order to get Mal to get out, had to plant the idea in her head that she was dreaming and that this reality was not real. He manages to do so successfully.3) In the real world Mal commits suicide because of the idea Cobb planted. He cannot forgive himself.4) The fact that Cobb feels so much guilt about what he did IS THE CENTRAL CRUX OF THE MOVIE. It is this guilt that does not allow him to ""see"" his children until he forgives himself.5) The movie also introduces us to the concept of paradox, the infinite loop that can be closed etc. This is a crucial step to understand because what Cobb ultimately seeks to accomplish is a paradox.6) The movie is truly about Cobb planting an idea in his own head but not tracing it back to himself. He needs to believe that he can forgive himself but not know that he initiated it.7) Throughout most of the movie, all the characters are PROJECTIONS of his subconscious. Ariadne is perhaps one of the most important projections because through her, he is being guided to his inception seemingly by someone else. She is a manifestation of his subconscious who is in essence helping him realize what he must do. In Greek mythology Ariadne is the Mistress of the Labyrinth, a subtle clue by Nolan.8) The idea requiring inception, is that ""he can return home"" to his children. The idea is simple but in order to introduce it Cobb needs to CREATE THE MOST COMPLEX world possible. This is done through the multiple dreams and multiple cast members who are ultimately projections. For evidence that it is a created world, keep in mind the numbers used throughout the last acts. Those numbers appear on the ticket that Cobb is holding. Those numbers may have special significance to Cobb, (perhaps the hotel where his wife committed suicide, the ages of his children, etc).9) When Mal attacks Cobb with a knife Ariadne shoots her. After which, Cobb let's go of Mal as a memory. Memories are dangerous because they call attention to the dream. By getting rid of Mal Cobb rids himself of evidence that he is dreaming.10) When Saito makes the phone call and allows Cobb back in the U.S., it is done because Cobb can believe that someone else has taken away the restriction. It was crucial for that to be there even though Cobb at any point could have seen his children.11) The spinning top does wobble a little bit when Cobb leaves the room. This lends some credibility to the thought that it is ""reality,"" however we do not see the top fall indicating that the whole thing may still be a dream. This seems to be a paradox, Cobb believes this is reality (top wobbles), but this is a dream (top never spins out). Can something be real to someone but still be a dream? Another paradox is discussed next.12) The movie itself reveals itself to be a paradox because Cobb's character plants an idea in his own head and then must disguise it. It means that over time Cobb figured out a way out from his guilt, it was a spontaneous idea (and quite brilliant). The problem is that he can still trace the idea back to himself. That would mean the guilt would still be there. Thus, the paradox is seemingly unsettled. How can one plant an idea in one's own head without realizing that you planted it there? 13) With respect to the ending/beginning on the beach. Keep in mind, Cobb's children appear but with backs to him on the same beach as his. It is the subconscious world. For proof that this is his dream, ask yourself ""how did he get from Mal's house to Saito's?"" Cobb just appeared. He ""needs"" to get Saito to leave because only then can he ""see his children."" Also the room where Saito is in is built from memory. Cobb admitted that he has a tendency to do this.Nolan has indeed incepted our minds. Thank you for reading and reviewing."
23313,True,"Writer-director Nolan is an elegant Hollywood hack from London whose movies are a colossal waste of time, money and I.Q. points. ""Elegant"" because his work always has a crisp use of color, shading and shadows, and ""hack"" because he always takes an expensive germ of an idea, reduces it to a series of cheap gimmicks and shreds it through a Cuisinart until it looks and sounds like every other incoherent empty B-movie made by people who haven't got a clue about plot, character development or narrative trajectory. Like other Christopher Nolan head scratchers-the brainless Memento, the perilously inert Insomnia, the contrived illusionist thriller The Prestige, the idiotic Batman Begins and the mechanical, maniacally baffling and laughably overrated The Dark Knight-this latest deadly exercise in smart-aleck filmmaking without purpose from Mr. Nolan's scrambled eggs for brains makes no sense whatsoever. Is it clear that I have consistently hated his movies without exception, and I have yet to see one of them that makes one lick of sense. It's difficult to believe he didn't also write, direct and produce the unthinkable Synecdoche, New York. But as usual, like bottom feeder Charlie Kaufman, Mr. Nolan's reputation as an arrogant maverick draws a first-rate cast of players, none of whom have an inkling of what they're doing or what this movie is about in the first place, and all of whom have been seen to better advantage elsewhere. Especially Leonardo DiCaprio, who remains one of the screen's most gullible talents. After his recent debacle in Shutter Island, Martin Scorsese's dopey insane-asylum bomb, one hoped for something more substantial from the easily misled Leo, not another deranged turkey like Inception. He should have stayed in bed.I'd like to tell you just how bad Inception really is, but since it is barely even remotely lucid, no sane description is possible. Let's see. It opens with crashing waves on a beach. In the middle of a July heat wave, I wanted to jump in, but the thrill didn't last. Cut to the battered face of Leo, looking like a 14-year-old washed ashore facedown from a toy sailboat. He has come from another location conjured up in a dream, and is fond of muttering jabberwocky like ""I am the most skilled extractor of dreams."" In other words, he can close his eyes, enter somebody else's dreams with his pock-marked baby face and blow up China. The excellent Marion Cotillard, who has spiraled a long way down from her Oscar-winning role as Edith Piaf, growing a wart in the center of her forehead in the bargain, is the ghost of his ex-wife. Leo lives in a state of guilt for her death. He is also a thief, plowing his way through dark kitchens waving guns with silencers to relieve locked safes of their contents. Living in a continual dream state, he wants only to get home to his father (Michael Caine in a walk-on of fewer than a dozen lines) and two kids, but first he must, according to the production notes, ""extract valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state when the mind is at its most vulnerable."" To this end, Mr. Nolan works in something about the world of corporate espionage that turns Leo into an international fugitive. Now, Leo and his team of special ""extractors"" must achieve ""inception""-meaning that instead of stealing dreams, they must plant some. If you're still awake, you're one step ahead of me. I dozed off ages ago.Through the use of computer-generated effects, buildings fold like cardboard containers, cars drive upside down and the only way you can wake up within the dream is death. None of this prattling drivel adds up to one iota of cogent or convincing logic. You never know who anyone is, what their goals are, who they work for or what they're doing. Since there's nothing to act, the cast doesn't even bother. It's the easiest kind of movie to make, because all you have to do is strike poses and change expressions. It all culminates on skis in the middle of a blizzard, as Leo is pursued by machine-gun-equipped snowmobiles, but you don't even know who's driving them. I have no idea what the market is for this jabbering twaddle-probably people who fritter away their time playing video games, which I'm willing to bet pretty much describes Christopher Nolan. He labors over turning out arty horror films and sci-fi action thrillers with pretensions to alternate reality, but he's clueless about how to deal with reality, honest emotions or relevant issues.Inception is the kind of pretentious perplexity in which one or two reels could be mischievously transposed, or even projected backward, and nobody would know the difference. It's pretty much what we've come to expect from summer movies in general and Christopher Nolan movies in particular, but I keep wondering: Can he do anything of more lasting value? He's got vision, but creating jigsaw puzzles nobody can figure out and using actors as puppets who say idiotic things, dwarfed by sets like sliding Tinker Toys, doesn't seem like much of an accomplishment to me."
23314,True,"I don't like to write too much about it. Other people have already written enough, why it's really bad. I think Christopher Nolan have bought all this votes and higher rating. IMHO: Worst movie this year. 1)Mindless action film about the mind. 2)Rather primitive 3)Most Overrated Movie of All time!! 4)Best part of the movie was when it ended :) 5)Are you people watching the same film as me!!???? 6)Totally simple story for an idiot dressed up with special effects and nothing more etc. etc. etc. It is unbelievable that this film has received such accolades by reviewers. It is as if the film itself is trying to practise in real life its own concept: planting in the viewer's mind from the inception that it has extraordinary merit. This must be the ultimate film business gambit and possibly the most daring ever tried in film promotion history. Surrounded by mind-numbing images and eleven-dimensional sound you are told a hundred times every minute what a great film you are viewing. Just look at the audience when you go to see it (as I am sure you will): they looked bored and perplexed but have arranged their faces in expressions of seeming appreciation in fear of being thought of as square, to use and old beatnik term. This would be the dullest film I have ever seen!"
23315,True,"Warning: spoiler alert:After watching Inception I have this question to ask: The movie played with the idea, that we can't always tell the difference between a dream and reality. Sometimes when dreaming, we realize, that we dream and that helps us awake. Other times, we don't realize that we are dreaming and then we are stuck in the dream. The question, which everybody ask themselves is: Did Cobb awake at the end of the movie or did he kept dreaming? I would like to ask this: DOES IT MATTER? Because through the two hours, I didn't get any background of this guy. I don't know who he is, what he likes to do, where are his faults, what are his hopes for the future. I am not even sure if he has a wife- and if he does, if Mal exists, then I don't know anything about her too. Not to mention their supposedly small children. My point is: This movie didn't have any story, didn't have any heart, didn't have any life in it. All characters were just figures, with no background and no emotional structure. So what do I care about Cobb, or his wife, or his mission? Because I don't even know what his mission was- to make the Asian guy even richer? And if you think it is so wonderful, that the movie didn't gets any straight answers, let me tell you this: the movie doesn't even ask a question. It doesn't make you think, because, at the end of it- there is no story behind it. There is no moral dilemma, there is no character development. And I feel really sorry for Leonardo Dicaprio - who started as a very promising actor, but somewhere in the way decided to act important and pretend to be smart. First he made The Blood Diamond- a very good movie. Then he made 11th Hour- a very good environmental movie. And then he went vacationing with Naomi Campbell on an yacht. What better way to prove that you believe in what you preach? Don't make the mistake to believe Inception has anything to offer, but some false sense of self importance."
23316,True,"""Inception"" is nothing more than a stupid, high-concept movie with an ideal target audience of geeky 14 year old boys who have little interest in the opposite sex. It's hard to believe therefore that this film has an average IMDb rating of 8.9 and has received such ecstatic levels of praise on this site.So, why don't I think that it is any good? Firstly, what is it ""about""? What are it's themes? Genuinely great contemporary film makers of the rational world , such as Michael Haneke, explore the fundamental elements of human experience and modern society. Haneke has explored the failure of communication, the influence of media, the difficulties of multi-culteralism, the survival of humanity and culture, the impact of violence etc etc. In comparison ""Inception"" has no themes or original ideas. The most interesting visual moments are lifted from a variety of sources ranging from ""2001"" to James Bond. The basic narrative consists of the struggle to make one huge corporation slightly bigger than another. Where is the human element in that? Where are the morals? Where is the redemption? The Capitalist system is helping the extremely rich get richer  the wealth of the richest 1% has doubled over the last 10 years  but do ordinary office workers and blue collars workers, who are getting screwed by the system, care whether one faceless giant corporation overcomes another? Where is the drama when you don't care about the outcome and don't care about the characters? It's a film that has no philosophical or human dimension. Indeed the treatment of the ""Mal"" character and the failure to have her impose some sense of human or emotional responsibility on the Cobb character show the film to actually be as morally bankrupt as the casino bankers. Human emotion and relationships are overlooked by boys who are in thrall to their CGI toys.Does it achieve what it sets out to deliver so far as atmosphere and tone are concerned? That great modern film maker of the subconscious world, David Lynch, has shown us that Cinema can show the dreams and nightmares of the human psyche, can show the ""other world"" that lives just below the tangible surface. But ""Inception"" use of dream states and the ""dream within a dream"" is extremely mundane. Comparing a work of genius, such as ""Mulholland Drive"", with this pedestrian fantasy demonstrates what a failure in atmosphere there is in this film. ""Inception"" is also completely lacking in sex. How can you have a film about dream states and the subconscious that is as flat and banal as this? Perhaps Christopher Nolan isn't comfortable in exploring this area? That might explain why he has agreed to cast Anne Hathaway, surely one of the least sexy leading ladies in modern cinema ( unless you get excited by the 11 year old/""Bambi"" look ) as sex icon Catwoman in his upcoming ""The Dark Knight Rises"". You just know all of the curves on this Catwoman are going to be part of the suit and as fake as the ""philosophy"" in ""Inception""! I've enjoyed several of Nolan's earlier films and I think ""Memento"" in particular is a fascinating film and a film that actually DOES have themes - of identity, memory and guilt. However, I think his move into the world of ""intelligent Blockbusters"" ( as if there can be such a thing!? ) have made him lose his way.The cast are uniformly flat in their performances. Some excellent performers such as Cillian Murphy, Marion Cotillard, Pete Postlethwaite etc are wasted in underdeveloped roles. At the core of the film is the perpetually furrowed brow and dead eyes of Leonardo Di Crapio. Indeed, one of the great mysteries of the modern cinema age is what, once great, filmmaker Martin Scorsese sees in this rubber faced, bland, not particularly intelligent presence. That's not to say that great sci-fi can't be made with a not very bright leading man. The first ""Matrix"" film is a wonderful film despite the somewhat befuddled presence of Keanu. But it is a great film because it has ideas, human drama, personal politics and the subtext that ""Inception"" lacks.The pacing throughout ""Inception"" is turgid, oh how I waited and waited for that white van to fall, and the po-faced self importance of the whole thing is laughable.Now that the big corporations own the studios, the distribution and the cinemas the films that get force fed to the public are decided by air heads in suits. As a result the average audience's exposure to intelligent cinema is in serious decline. It's a shame that an essentially vacuous piece of escapism like ""Inception"" is being spoken of as being an intelligent piece of film making because if this is the future of ""intelligent"" cinema then, ladies and gentlemen, cinema is dead."
23317,True,"It beggars belief how both critics and movie-goers have been won over by this pseudo-intellectual piece of garbage. Really world? I thought better of you.There were three key problems for me in this movie. The first was the love story. Blah. I mean really, BLAH. This was an action based thriller, whose ultimate fate was rested on DiCaprio's characters obsession with his dead wife. Ultimately the film could have achieved its original thought provoking intentions had it dumped the obligatory Hollywood love story entirely.My second issue with this movie was the teams motivation for going into the energy tycoons son was weak. If you really want to get your audience thinking, why not try to get a politician to push through a new law, or stop the production of nuclear warheads? Why focus an entire movie, so well shot and expertly produced, in trying to get someone to break down a business? Finally, and maybe this was just me because I was disconnecting with the film at this point, but some of the dialogue was just way too cheesy and over the top. ""A dream within a dream within a dream? It's never been done before!"" All in all a big let down, mainly because the concept was great and some of the scenes were incredibly filmed, yet the producers bowed to the same old Hollywood model. Not all of us need to see a love story in order to engage our brains y'know."
23318,True,"Yes, this means better then star wars? better then Aliens, better then the matrix, even better then 2001: a space odyssey, OK stop! If this is the way we are going with Scifi, just stop making scifi movies. This movie reminds me to much about taxes (in taxes, in taxes, in taxes) How can someone think that a movie, where people are killed in dreams, is the best scifi ever made? How is it possible that i find countless of review pages here with people that rate the movie below average and still be the best scifi ever? This movie is a shame for the scifi scene overall. almost fell asleep from this.I specially had to make an account here just to vent my frustration about this film."
23319,True,"Life is too short for this clichéd nonsense. The editing is truly dreadful and distracts from the experience. And it's a pretty meagre experience. There are more plot holes than in an actual dream. Very overacted too with cheap dialogue, ala: Cobb: I have it under control. Arthur: I'd hate to see it out of control. I mean c'mon, lines like that would be out of place in a TV movie, never mind a supposed work of art.Also, it might be a good idea to get an actor as your main man instead of Leonardo Di Caprio. I don't believe I've seen a single good movie he's been in. He managed to drag The Departed down, ruined (littered?) The Beach and starred in at least two awful movies: Titanic and Shutter Island. I've been spared most of his other shallow thespian endeavours.It's yet another turn of Hollywood's bloated corpse. Stick a fork in it, it's done."
23320,True,"After reading a few of the reviews on this site, we decided to watch ""Inception"", and we went with great expectations. Unfortunately, the movie was a big disappointment.The impression ""Inception"" leaves is that the director tried to squeeze as much action as possible into one movie, and it seems that it was therefore that the story was split into reality and four additional ""unreal"" dreamworlds which are displayed almost simultaneously. There is hardcore-action with aggressive special effects, fighting, killing, excessive shooting, explosions, car-chases, snowmobile-chases and the liking in every layer, and the permanent hopping from one layer to another makes this a non-stop-action-flick while the story behind all this seems to take a back seat.If one likes action and special effects, the movie might be interesting - the storytelling is poor. The plot and the technology involved are so complicated that, after a while, one gets indifferent. There is almost no identification with the main characters. In this movie, almost anything can happen, and the audience will accept it because it can't follow the story. Like this, no suspension can be built, and over two hours full of action without suspense and bad storytelling can be rather tiring.The story itself is not very clever. The setup reminds of the ""Matrix"" - the old question of what is really real. However, the idea of an powerful Asian industrial boss who hires a crew to secretly invade his competitor's brain in order to increase his own profit (and who deliberately risks his own life during the operation) is very far fetched. He could just as well shoot all of his competitors, because according to the story, the Asian boss is so powerful that he does not have to fear any governmental action. So, why invading brains, risking the own life and the life of others instead of just getting rid of the trouble by shooting it? Then, there is a weird aspect about the dreaming itself. I can imagine that everything happens inside my own dream, but to have many people dream the same dream simultaneously because they are plugged to a special device... I don't know. I am not someone who screams for logic in movies, but this was hard to take.This movie is just an action movie disguised as clever science-fiction which it is absolutely not. There are great special effects, but there are too many of them and after a while they seem to become an end in themselves. The story is badly told, and the movie leaves you with nothing to think about."
23321,True,"dream in a dream in a dream = existenz planting an idea = what do you mean planting an idea is original . i can list bigger ideas other movies plant . THE MATRIX 1999 = planting the idea into everyone making them believe they are in reality . TOTAL RECALL 1990 = a false 2 week vacation memory has been planted in ARNOLD. and for you guys that says dreams and virtual reality is different. wrong . what is presented in inception is a dream that looks like reality . a place that is constructed for the subject to feel real. if you wanna see a dream then watch paprika or the holy mountain . a ""dream that is constructed to feel real"" and a ""virtual reality"" IS basically the SAME . so what is new in inception ? NOTHING . just some cool looking characters does not make a film good ."
23322,True,"A Movie that contains everything needed to be a Masterpiece. With Great acting from every actor in it, this movie is a have to see thriller.This PG-13 movie will make your mind question it's self. Everyone must see this movie!!! and how Brilliant it really truly is...the Action keeps the heart pumping, while the little settle ideas, keeps you thinking...From beginning to end.. no one will see the end coming.. the music complemented the acting, the area of complexion that this movie carries..everything a movie should have.. is in this one ""Inception"""
23323,True,"Inception has the capacity to blow you away.Just like the classics of decades gone by,namely The Godfather movies and movies by the likes of Scorcese and Scott, this movie is the classic of our generation and Nolan truly deserves his place among the elite.The movie has a scintillating pace throughout and the premise despite being far-fetched has a believable quality to it thanks to some amazing performances and intelligent direction.The viewer is immediately thrown into Nolan's world of corporate espionage and extraction of ""ideas"".The editing is magnificent as the audience is often subjected to following multiple narratives without losing connection with the plot.There is a lot of craft involved in revealing just about enough at just the right time to keep you on the edge.Once the movie pushes into the triple-dream-layer sequence one cannot help but gape in astonishment at how mind boggling special-effects are seamlessly combined with the intricacies of the plot.The climax,quite simply, takes your breath away just like the climaxes of earlier Nolan films like ""Following"" and ""The Dark Knight"".The performances are commendable and one wonders how Nolan always seems to get his casting perfectly apt.Leonardo DiCaprio has evolved so much from the days of ""Titanic"".His role,though similar to the one he played in ""Shutter Island"", evokes sympathy for the man whose inner guilt poses the greatest hazard to the mission.Its a balanced performance and his scenes with Marion Cotillard are terrific.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a pleasant surprise turning in a very neat job with his portrayal of Arthur.Ken Watanabe is quite classy and exudes panache throughout.Tom Hardy and Ellen Page play their parts well.But the one to look out for is Cillian Murphy.In his role of an heir to a billionaire oil tycoon,he excels in bringing out the torment and angst associated with living in the shadow of his father.Michael Caine though, is a bit underused and one always yearns to see more of him.Hanz Zimmer has once again emerged with a winning score which completely takes over the movie in the final few minutes and pushes the climax a few notches higher.The undertone is a tad similar to the one used in ""Shutter Island"" but one enjoys the ominous music as it lends a certain gravity to the overall mood.All in all, if you watch it once,you will watch it again.And then again.And again.Because each viewing offers something new.Something extra.When I saw ""The Dark Knight"", I said to myself that Nolan has truly reached his pinnacle and that this here is his masterpiece.Its a pity that I did not check my totem then.I must have been dreaming!"
23324,True,"....the sound of bullets pouring through the cab or the van they were in. The movie has nice actors, it's too long, and your eyes might start rolling the fourth or fifth time they explain the rules to you. it's watchable mostly because it looks good in stretches. There is a memorable city-falling-into-the-sea moment late in the movie that felt a little like Planet of the Apes meets Dark City. And...the action is just silly at times. Give me all the dream levels you want but if the bad guys are going to miss that badly that often maybe you could suggest to me that the bullets are missing because they want them to miss. I mean, one of the good guys got to fire a grenade launcher simply because he wished it were so. But then why bother to run at all? Take your time, the traffic downtown is bad all hours of the dream day. So bullets do matter in these dreams, as the deadly powerful yet instantly trustworthy Japanese guy who wants to create the world's largest (publicly owned/traded?...what's their symbol on the Nikkei?) energy company gets shot and we have to live with his chest wound for half the movie. It might have been an amusing Groundhog Day/Highlander scenario if they had all been continuously turned into swiss cheese and brought out of it to plan and try again. Ellen Page could have drawn up some more pleasant cityscapes using a charcoal pencil. That was a nice airy studio they were in."
23325,True,"A terrible movie starring a bad actor, Lenny DiCaprio, that goes on far too long and gives the first justification for divorce I have ever heard on screen:---- I miss you more than I can bear... ---- but we had our time together. ---- And I have to let you go. ---- I have to let you go.The heroes taunt each other with an uplifting tagline:---- I'm an old man. ---- Filled with regret. ---- Waiting to die alone.So what did you expect from a divorce?But not to worry, our character is young and returns home to his children. His dying alone will have to be postponed until they graduate from high school."
23326,True,"First of all, let me premise this review by saying that I'm not easy. Hollywood seldom makes movies that I think are worth watching and 2010 has been a particularly bad year. I don't watch children's or teen's films so those aren't considered in my comments.Inception is in no way Christopher Nolan's conception which is oddly the only thing that actually supports the entire theory of it. It's a planted thought. Le Guin dealt with the idea in Lathe of Heaven back in 1971. The concept of course would never fly since humans don't trust each other, let alone strangers, or to the extant necessary as outlined by Nolan. Taking it to more levels changes nothing but shows that the obvious is being ignored.The bad cinematography keeps the viewer from seeing scenes at the beginning of the film or was that just to save money? When a phone call ends and one party hangs up, you don't get a busy signal. Picking a team you trust means using a total stranger who is willing to go along with doing something illegal? Interesting definition of trust.The characters were not engaging. Not necessarily bad acting, you just didn't care about them. Leonardo's character was boring and predictable. The others were necessary for him to talk to/at and tell the rules to, only to break them.For all of the eye candy, the film lacked imagination or maybe it was budget constraints or maybe Nolan is just incapable of dreaming.I don't need a totem, just a refund."
23327,True,"I am probably one of the few who did not like this movie. I like Chris Nolan as a director. I liked _Memento_, _Batman Begins_, and I loved his rendering of _The Dark Knight_. The problem I have with this movie is two-fold: First, dreams are not like the way they are depicted in this film. In dreams, you are not conversing with other individuals about highly technical subjects. In this movie's dream sequences, the characters are continuously explaining what's happening, and what's going to happen. And they are involved in the complex programming for the next level of the dream. In other words, the characters think, act, and behave as if they are not in a dream at all. It's a lot of exposition - really, a whole lot - and in my experience, dreams are just not like that. Yes things happen in dreams, and yes there are plenty of visual and auditory sensations - but I've never had a dream where someone gave me a 15 minute detailed technical explanation of what was going to happen next. I guess I wanted the dream sequences to be, well, more dream-like.Secondly, Leo's ill-fated romance just seemed to go nowhere. Every time that story thread comes up - the pace of the movie freezes. Leo has a way of delivering his lines very earnestly and urgently - and that's great and usually works well, as in _The Departed_. But if the script is weak - it just comes off as annoying and phony. I'm not sure what could replace the love interest thread - but it really hurt the movie in my opinion. I liken it to the relationship between Anakin and Padme in _Star Wars: Attack of the Clones_ - the second SW prequel - although that love interest was even harder to bear.I think the idea behind _Inception_ is great and original - but those two issues sank it for me."
23328,True,"I suppose you have to hand it to Chris Nolan. He made Warners so much money with his Batman revamp that was able to call the shots and sell not only them but a large segment of the (i suspect mostly male) movie going audience this risible turd of celluloid.Forget about the unoriginality (The Matrix, the architect), the protracted opening 45 minute snooze fest explanation and the sleepwalking acting (Dicaprio included). What really bugged me was that the whole corporate espionage yarn was a complete red herring. It was an excuse to tag on some action sequences that some impressive CG aside were really nothing to shout about. The alpine scene (sorry layer) was especially lame. I almost expected to see Burton and Eastwood appear on screen chased by Nazi mountain troops. Maybe someone could have dreamt them into the story at this point. Or even James Bond.Plot summary and spoiler alert below- You see Dicaprio had this problem with his wife committing suicide instigated by a previous inception so to rid him of her malign influence from his own dreams we are given this convoluted tedium in which another character who may be real or more likely may not be real eventually pops the wife in a dream so that Lenny can see his kids again, in a dream. Please."
23329,True,"I would like to say just something short, and I hope that some of the directors will notice that: Please, let the Matrix alone. You can't beat it with quasi ideas. This film for me is nothing but a stolen ideas. Even from Anachronox I found some stolen ideas. The plot is based on the stolen idea, even if it has some originality, all around the plot is empty because it is without some deeper thoughts.If the resources were spent on wrapping some more flesh around the details and story, all could have be different... Like this, too many questions: How they meet each other in the dreamworld? Where are the details and explanations? What HOLDING that world to don't fall apart????... There are more questionable reactions and scenes, but I don't want to go deeper because it is not worth.This film is insult for the Matrix fans.And by the way, only old people can lay down and sleep immediately."
23330,True,"I had hoped that the movie would have been more like the part where the girl changed the environment around her (in the dream world), bet the art of inception of course was ability to maintain stability. I was frustrated that the budget was gone almost solely for the slow-mo effects, but to a constantly changing environment. But thats OK, I don't think it would be possible to make such a movie under 400 million and in such a small production time that it was made, so for the effort that Nolan had done - A GREAT MOVIE, just not what i expected. The plot wasn't stupendously simple, it was quite intriguing, but way too explanatory, I can't imagine what went on Noaln's mind when he thought of a dream within a dream, that wasn't a particularly smart move."
23331,True,"Acclaimed director Christopher Nolan scores with the general movie-going audience once again with his highly anticipated film INCEPTION (2010). The hook for this film is it's exploration into the concept and idea of ""dreams"". Frankly, my immediate response when I saw this film was that the it's definition of dreams seems to be more based on NOLAN's interpretation and not the general consensus! Some of it sounded correct, while some of it sounded like mumbo jumbo! At the same time, Nolan essentially executes the dream aspects of the movie within his own set of rules and more or less does not violate them, which is actually part of the problem. In the big picture, I don't think dreams work the way this movie portrays them.INCEPTION stars Leonardo DiCaprio as dream expert extractor Cobb. DiCaprio gives a passable performance, but it's not anything mesmerizing or Oscar-caliber. Frankly, I think that this actor is probably the most overrated major star of the last decade. It's partially that he's a victim of his eternal youthful look, so it makes it hard to take him seriously in these ""adult"" roles; I feel like he's being forced upon me as a star, rather than truly being one! Unlike when he was a teen actor in the early to mid 90s, I don't find him very engaging as an adult actor. He simply doesn't draw me in. And, actually, in this movie, I was more engaged by the other ensemble's performances more than his. He felt like a 5th wheel, especially since it was his character that was actually an impediment to the mission succeeding.The real acting standouts in the film for me were Cillian Murphy and former Best Actress Oscar winner Marion Cotillard. Murphy plays the team's target Robert Fischer, whose billionaire industrialist father had recently died, so Cobb's team was on an assignment, paid by Fischer's main competitor Saito (a solid Ken Watanabe) to implant an idea in his mind to liquidate his father's empire. Murphy did a much better job showing depth and character detail than DiCaprio, whose tale was actually more tragic, with his dreams haunted by the memory of his late wife Mal (hauntingly played by Cotillard, and I actually didn't realize it was her until the end credits rolled!). The capable supporting cast playing Cobb's ""dream team"" is led by up and coming star Ellen Page (as Ariadne, a specialist in architecture, who constructs the dream landscape for the film's big mission). Although she was underused mainly as a fascinated observer and Cobb's support, I found Page to be very engaging. After constructing the dream landscape, Ariadne's assignment was to protect Cobb from his demonic subconscious in the form of his late wife Mal. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fine also as Arthur, Cobb's sidekick who monitors the dreamers to ensure that they eventually get ""kicked"" (treated rather flimsily in this movie!) out of them. Tom Hardy is also good as Eames, a forger whose expertise is needed in the dreams to shapeshift his appearance to the dreamer. Dileep Rao soundly functions as chemist Yusef, creator of the drug that will allow the team to go into 3 levels of dream states in order to execute the mission.Where INCEPTION actually drew me in was in the last half, with it's steamrolling action sequences as the dreamers went from level to level, which I did not expect at all! I thought this was going to be some kind of mind-bending, trippy exercise, which it really wasn't. The way the movie portrays dreaming is actually very pat and linear, and the miniscule complexity is what allows the viewer to follow and be more engaged in the action. That is, while not completely mindless (pardon the pun!), the dream state stuff is pretty easy to follow. Also, Nolan did a good job of defining how the different levels work in the film's opening sequence.My biggest complaint about the film is it's rather simplistic way of describing dreams, and this ties in with the DiCaprio character Cobb, who was the biggest detriment to the mission because of his subconscious drawing his wife Mal into the dreams at inopportune moments. Other than the dreamer himself, why weren't any of the other teams subconscious in the dreams coming into play? Basically, Cobb was the only team member whose subconscious posed a wild card threat, which is hard to believe. If you take Cobb out of the equation, the mission runs a lot smoother than it actually did. Cobb is the only reason for a true threat to exist and for there to be any suspense, and after a while, I found the Cobb-Mal stuff to be more of a distraction than an important plot point. Minus Cobb, the movie is really just a simple action flick with no true threats in the dreams other than the main dreamer's typical subconscious threats, which were basically a bunch of useless gun-toting brutes who couldn't hit the side of a barn! Again, it was all very entertaining, but definitely not groundbreaking.INCEPTION was nominated for Best Picture, in part I think due to the fact that there are 10 nominations now. Chances are it would not have been nominated if there were only still 5 since Nolan himself didn't garner a Best Director nomination. Enteraining experience, but definitely not Oscar-worthy."
23332,True,"Sorry about my English, is not really good.I've seen this movie yesterday, and after it I asked to myself ""What the hell was that?""First of all: I think the way that Nolan complicated the history is completely unnecessarily. Nolan gives you 100 dater per second, only to confuse you, so, you think ""Oh, it's complicated, it's a smart movie, it's great, I'm a smart guy"" Well, maybe you are not. The story could be easier and didn't lose the meaning (which is very stupid). Nolan make it difficult only for make it difficult. Second: What's the point of make 30 seconds' scenes? Make you feel sick and queasy. Can't Nolan make longer scenes? They talk ten seconds and Nolan shows you visual effects ten seconds, and then they talk about dreams another ten seconds, and then Nolan show you how a piece of cheesecake can become in a lemon pie, and over and over, and that's all. The history is silly, the plot is poor. The few jokes are bad. The characters are not interesting. The dialogs are really, really awful.Third: 3º best movie ever? What are you thinking about? Come on, must be a joke. Why is so cool? The idea is not original (seems to be a mix among Freddy Krugger, Matrix and an article about Freud take from Wikipedia), the visual effects are fine but have not sense at all (There are easier ways to say ""everything is on our mind""). I can't find what is so greatFourth: I think (maybe I'm wrong) many people like this movie cause it make them feel smart, and they believe that they've seen an intellectual movie. Well, I'm not an expert in philosophy or psychology (in fact, I know very little), and I know that the movie is fiction, but anyway, some concepts are completely wrong. I'm in the school yet (third world school), and we had psychology classes last year, and the teacher taught us that the subconscious is result of repressed impulses, so, you want your mother (in a sexual way) and the culture say you ""that's wrong and disgusting"" so you can't support it, and that's why you have dreams, because it's so hard to tolerate so you eliminate it from your conscience, but that is still in your mind, in your subconscious. So, what DiCaprio says about subconscious (Is result of our emotions) is wrong. He says the subconscious is something subjective (our ideas, our emotions), and is not. What make our subconscious is the culture what cause a guilty filling.And this year we've got philosophy and we've seen something about Idealism, and skepticism. It's not true that everything is idea. There is a reality, and our mind is made of this reality. This reality (the Society) makes our conscience, and the culture (which is real) make our subconscious. So, everything we think has a reality inception. We are made of reality. Would be great if in the middle of the movie Nicky Santoro (Casino) appeared and says to DiCaprio "" Maybe if I stick your head through that window over there you won't think that everything is an idea"" That's it. We need more Scorsese and less Nolan.Fifth: Does anybody find an interesting story? Because, I've seen a lot of guys saying thing about dreams and everything-is-an-idea (Yes Nolan, we get it. You don't have to repeat over and over). But the stories are pretty poor; Di Caprio's story and why the police is looking him, and his ex-wife, and his children didn't trap me at all. What's more, the story about the rich guy and his father is, for me, completely ridiculous. Nolan is very smart, he could think something smarter than that.So, What do we have? Visual effects and ideas that were taken for guys who died 300 years ago (like Descartes) or even before (like the skepticism Greeks). There is nothing new, or brilliant in ""Nolan's idea"". What we have is a lot of visual effects without meaning, and nothing else.Is this one of the best movies ever?"
23333,True,"Just saw this movie - can't say I want my $6 back, but I'm glad it wasn't $7.Christopher Nolan made a much better movie with far fewer resources when he made 'Memento'.Paul Verhoven made the same movie 10 times better both in terms of plot, pacing, and action sequences in 'Total Recall'.If you threw Memento, Total Recall, and The Matrix in a blender for a little while, this is what you would come up with. It's not a bad movie, but anyone with a pulse and half a brain could call the shocking surprise ending after watching the first 10 minutes - at least I did.Mr. Nolan seems to be trying revisit the successes of yesteryear a la M. Night Shyamalan.Indeed, he seems to be trailing back around to a 'dead wife' motif much as Tom ""Dead or Dying Father"" Cruise (Top Gun / Rain Man / Magnolia / A Few Good Men),"
23334,True,"Well ,after watching it in the theaters (I wasn't expecting much since the beginning of it) I've finally decided to write a review as honest as possible. It's simply another commercial trick that was made in purpose to get the money out of your wallets and it's just another one of those movies pretending to be some kind of an intelligent movie -and well...it's not exactly quality -more like garbage. The whole idea of 'breaking into people's dream and thoughts' is a total stealing from many TV shows and other movies ,comic books etc...you've all seen it before ,I mean -how many times have you seen this idea before?...dozens at least , not mentioning the stupid plot which is just ridiculous.The idea of making an idea more messy then it actually is is pretty dumb--it's not making any sense at all. It's way overrated and way too hyped and doesen't even deserve half the half of it's rating ,not mentioning how unconvincing the entire cast was -the whole thing is a big waste of time :it's boring ,endless and very uninspired ,total unoriginal garbage stealing other people's ideas and thoughts while numbing stupid people's brains even more... If you didn't understand the movie or just hated it ,I'll strongly recommend you to read Rex Reed's review on Observer."
23335,True,"This movie was just really, really boring. Nothing particularly bad about it; just nothing very good. Just like True Grit and Forrest Gump, by about halfway through the movie, I gave up caring what happened next. The characters were largely unrelatable and for the most part unbelievable. The effects were good on the big screen, but they definitely won't carry the film when set on a smaller screen in someone's living room. And Nolan was right to worry that the combination of Marion Cotillard and ""I Regret Nothing"" would be a big distraction. The movie was easily thirty minutes longer than it needed to be, yet in the overallocation of time Nolan still could not set up enough of a real connection between the characters to explain why they would all be so loyal and invested in one another (particularly Ariadne; why does she care? She just met these guys). Just more evidence that Oscar picks are really just vanity pieces, and the Best Movie list is your go-to for time-wasters to avoid."
23336,True,"This film has everything that you would want for in a film this complex and mind bending... everything except an ending that makes sense of it all! After spending over 2 hours falling through levels, and bending my mind around levels within levels withing levels, and still not knowing what the hell any of this is about, i simply concluded that the film was one big piece of slightly boring eye candy that made, and was supposed to make, absolutely no sense what so ever! And as a giant piece of eye fluff it does pretty well... but it could have been so much more! You might ask what more? but to be honest i can really say... and really it doesn't matter any way - because it's not my film! I am so tired of telling other people how to fix their films... after they are already in the can! Figure it out yourself!"
23337,True,"I must have seen a different film than all those who gave this such a high rating.By making this interesting plot of dream interception into an action film was not a good idea (to me at any rate)Most of the budget went to the cost of bullets, explosions & car crashes.The film runs 148 LONG minutes, We probably have a real decent drama of 90 minutes.Leonardo Decaprio is as usual good..The supporting players are all name actors,BUT they do not have much to do except shoot bullets & wreck cars.The production is good,its the script & needless constant action that hurts the film.Ratings: **1/2--- 74 points --- IMDb 6"
23338,True,"I have heard many good reviews about this movie but somehow this movie just did not work for me. I watched this movie two months ago in a nearby theatre with my sister. My sister found this movie to be a brilliant one but not me. The idea used in this movie is a good one, the storyline is decent and the special effects used are creative and well done. I like the dreamlike quality of this movie. The anti-gravitational scenes and one scene where stuff starts to explode all over the place was well made. This movie has got a lot of action taking place with some interesting violent scenes. The ending was a very well done and unique one. However, there are just to many things I did not like about this movie so it did not really work for me. This movie is far too complicating, possibly one of the most complicating movies I have ever seen. I have to watch the movie and try to fit in the pieces of jigsaw puzzle for this movie at the same time. I found it very difficult to understand what each character was doing, and what happened. One of the most difficult to understand scenes include the scenes around the first few minutes. The opening scene during the first few minutes was just confusing. I love the idea used in this film though and the spinning of the top was interesting. However this movie is just too confusing from the start to the end credits that it just did not work for me. Sorry. I still would recommend this movie due to its originality though. Score: 6/10"
23339,True,"I sat there in the dark when the last shot transitioned to blackout followed by the first credit appearing: ""DIRECTED BY CHRISTOPHER NOLAN."" And I didn't have the same or even remotely similar sinking feeling followed with audible laughter I did back when I saw ""Memento"" with its famous closing line. I know you cannot re-invent the wheel, but why-- why does everybody have a h#@$-on for everything this man does? ""The Dark Knight."" ""The Prestige."" Is anybody going to ever tell this man that he's not Stanley Kubrick? Or does he surround himself with yes-men the same way that George Lucas does? He hasn't graduated from the James Cameron School of Arrogance yet (hoping that he never attends). I didn't think that this was a bad film- it wasn't a typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood drecks you see week, but it wasn't that good either. Even though Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report"" started to lose its way towards the end, it was more entertaining and ""thought-provoking"" at times than this. I won't even get into the plot since so many other posters already have, and I know I'll be shot down for voicing any more criticism over this ""masterpiece,"" but I hope-- I REALLY, REALLY hope that Christopher Nolan will make another ""Memento"" again. Maybe even a sequel, but no more ""Inception""s please."
23340,True,"This film is downright boring. I literally almost fell asleep at a noon showing. I also almost walked out 35 minutes before it ended; I simply did not care about any of these characters. The effects are neat, and look pretty great, but the story is so asinine that... wait, no, the story isn't asinine, its execution is.At its heart, this is the story of a man who regrets something that he said to his wife and through the miracle of modern technology, he believes he's able to unring a bell. That's it, really. Yet, rather than tell that story, a bunch of other nonsense is heaped in for ... I dunno why, to be honest with you.In addition, the film sets up its own rules and seems to break them at will. ""We can't do that or this will happen!"" seems to be the recurring predicament and yet, when at the crossroads, they just do ""this"" anyway and don't suffer the consequence, or they create some back door which, according to the logic presented earlier in the film, was impossible. As an example, there's a scene where the Page character, the Architect, is given her first ""go hence"" and she creates a compelling world that she managed to manipulate with ease. In fact, the Leo character comments--twice!--on how amazing she is at it. And yet, when they re- enter (or create another) dreamworld, they are all of a sudden ambushed on all sides. Their truck is pursued and shot up, etc etc. However, they've already shown that the Dreamworld does not have to obey the regular laws of physics, or anything really... why not just have things fall from the sky and crush the bad guys? When ""trapped"" on the middle of the bridge (someplace they need and want to be), why not just create physical barriers between themselves and the bad guys so the bullets can't hit them but they can still drive off?Perhaps the director's answer to that question is that these are TRAINED military attackers! Uh huh, which is why 8 million of them are unable to shoot up one van driven by a chemist. The same problem occurs earlier in the film, in the real world, when a bunch of agents are chasing Leo. Why give them guns? If it's a foot-chase, I'll buy what I was shown. By arming the pursuers, all I do is roll my eyes every 3 seconds at how preposterous the escape is. It's the equivalent of showing a bomb with 3 minutes left where the screen time is still a half hour. Guess what, Hollywood: your choices had the opposite effect you intended. Our anxiety isn't heightened, but our disbelief is.Further, when you're watching the action, you're aware that it takes place one, two and three levels deep. The further out you are from the farthest depth, the slower your action takes place. This is seen correctly when the van goes off the bridge... but if it were in fact the case, the van could not drive at regular speed prior to that... it would be slow all the time. That would be boring, you say. (I say it was boring anyway--Nolan proves once again that he's the worst action-sequence director going.) But boring isn't the issue. Time and Distance are. If it were slower, as it should be, they couldn't traverse the distance needed to the bridge.... which brings up the question that if you're the one creating the world, why not make your two destinations side by each? The hotel and the bridge do not need to be at opposite ends of the city, considering the bad guys are not going from the bridge to the hotel. There is constant reference prior to the world being created that it's a maze. No, actually, it isn't. There's nothing maze like about it. In another scene, two of the main protagonists, who we've been shown are EXPERT in the work they do, declare the mission a failure and complete. But the Page character, who joined the team a mere few days ago, stands up and explains to the experts how it's not over and can still go on. I groaned out loud at that one, not only because it's a ridiculous thing to expect your audience to swallow, but because it meant there was another 30 minutes left. Anyway, I'm rambling on. The acting was fine, the ideas in the story are interesting, but the film as a whole was very insignificant. There is so much needless exposition, it's laughable. (And there's a lack of exposition where needed.) In short, the film lacks grace. It really is unfortunate that Nolan's career, from an artistic level, is tanking so poorly. Worse is that his box office is not reflecting this, which will only encourage this behavior. The man's first 3 features were fantastic but since then he's just been getting worse and worse. Though I don't think this film is half as bad as Dark Knight, it isn't a tenth as creative or well done as The Following, Insomnia, or Memento, which it doesn't appear he will ever top."
23341,True,"People love to talk about the relationship between cinema and dreams. As a slightly surreal artform in and of itself, directors and artists have always tweaked with the filmic space of perception to achieve dream or dream-like effects. The problem I typically find in almost all movies attempting to recreate dreams is that they do so in too literal a way, often drawing attention to the dream effect they are portraying. This becomes even more difficult to pull off in movies that question the line between dreams and reality (a much more obvious line than pop philosophy ever really acknowledges) pretty much have to point out the dream techniques of the production you are watching. This is Nolan's central dilemma, and one he doesn't really manage to transcend. As a visual invention in technical prestidigitation, this movie is successful, but it is too bogged down by exposition to really let its dream-scapes breathe.Really, this movie is closer to The Matrix than Paprika, a Satoshi Kon animated movie I expected it to be closer to. A core group of technopirates get into people's dreams to steal information, but now they are a challenged by a corporate agent to actually plant an idea in the head of a target instead of steal the idea. This process is called inception. Now Nolan goes the correct route and centers the action around the head of the dream stalkers, Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Seems Cobb has some mental juju to work out that keeps ""projecting"" into the missions he undertakes (Nolan misses the point of Freudian ""projection"", but hits a cute pun on the very medium we are watching). So as these mercenaries of the subconscious get ready for their mission, it is complicated by the fact that their intrepid leader at any point can cause phantasmic chaos. Enter a few rules about dying and waking up, losing your mind and creating mental labyrinths, and you basically have the movie's own architecture for what ultimately, when it comes down to it, past all the rhetoric and screen wizardry, becomes a series of set-pieces.Nolan creates a world where this technology exists, and sets the rules of the technology. He then adds the element that in a world where that technology exists, rich people like Cobb's target would have defenses set up. These defenses translate into literal nobody adversaries for whiz bang action. In order that death seem actually like a bad thing (beyond just waking up), he sets Limbo. Then the movie goes, losing track of what is essentially at the core of everything the audience cares about--Cobb's inception, and the working through the guilt he has. I guess ultimately Nolan didn't want to remake Shutter Island. I'm not sure DiCaprio really felt a huge difference between either role.So we're not in legitimate dream world here. The characters are too aware, the dreamy twists on reality are pointed out and explained via direct real-world correlations, the subconscious is generally predictable and follows ineffectual actions from barely described motivations, and in order to get there Nolan has to cram way too much exposition into the first twenty minutes, instead of dwell on the central drama of the entire movie, Cobb and his wife. That's fine because then we're in Nolan's world, not dream world, and he can make any rules he wants. So he does, and you get... you know.... chase sequences, Siberian battles, explosions. If Nolan is expressing anything in his subconscious here, it's that he deeply regrets not having an opportunity yet to direct a James Bond movie.However it's not all that bad. The story of Cobb, the creation of the labyrinths, the technical beauty of it all is engaging science fiction cinema. The only root problem is Nolan's asking of the somewhat clichéd albeit age old question, ""What is the difference between dreams and reality?"" Because no filmmaker who brings up this question never answers that question definitively, audiences shouldn't expect for it to be here. However, Nolan does miss one definite thing about dreams that does not work in his scenario.In Inception, Cobb and his wife live, and age, for years in a dream world of their own creation. Later, his wife cannot tell if them waking up came to another level of dream, or if they finally achieved reality. I would just point out the obvious: In dreams, you never go to sleep. You may wake up, but even in Inception, going to sleep within sleep requires an apparatus.Problem solved.--PolarisDiB"
23342,True,"Its all a dream. How do you know its a dream? Because it got a 9.4 rating. I'm waiting for a train. Its bringing a real rating of a 4. But the train doesn't come. This is not my dream. Omg. I'm going to wake up, and the real rating will be a 4, like reality. Reality as it should be, if movies were properly rated. But there's an explosion. The movie is still rated a 9.4. If I jump, maybe out of a window and die in my dream, which is someone else's dream, I might wake up to get the real rating of this movie, a 4. The van falls, I'm drowning. Finally after a long long long time, I wake up. Thank god it was all a dream. I check the rating at IMDb. OMG NO! I must still be in someone else's dream.As the big blockbuster movies become more awful, their rating consistently get higher. Any time I see a high rated (7+) new movie on a major rating website I become suspicious now. Too many times I've wasted money on crap movies because the rating said it was good. I guess they decided to push it to the limits of a 10 this time to really fool people like me that are becoming wary.The movie deserves about a 4 out of 10. The 4 is given for the nice colors and pretty good graphics. However, the plot is weak, the characters are weak, its not thought provoking or intellectual. There's no brilliant script or any new directional style here. And it feels longer than a run on sentence.Long. Boring. Jumbled. Good concept and stars wasted on this movie. See it if you have to, but don't spend money on it. Every time we spend money to see bad movies it sends a message that we are willing to accept less, and pay more. Your money is your real vote. Only vote for what is good."
23343,True,"I generally like the stuff Christopher Nolan does, but Inception did nothing for me. Within 5 minutes of watching the movie and hearing Lucas Haas's cringe-worthy line of ""No, it's my dream""(not a direct quote, but it was something to that effect) I almost fell to the floor laughing. Bad writing happens even in good movies, so I figured it was just a slip-up...except every scene felt like a repeat of those first 5 minutes. I'm not going to go line for line on everything wrong with Inception because if you really want to find out if you're going to like this movie or not, I suggest watching it for yourself. I came in with high expectations and saw a really bad film. You're more than welcome to disagree with my opinion but I hate it when people won't accept someone not liking a critically-acclaimed movie because it goes against the tide. I only say this because when telling someone how I disliked Inception I was quickly informed that ""I didn't get it"". It's a film about a team going into people's minds and heisting their dreams to plant suggestions that potentially affect real life choices. It's an interesting concept that was poorly executed. I ""got it"", but I just didn't like it."
23344,True,"I had read many reviews, citing this movie to be one of the best movie ever made, and as it was a nolan's work and starring dicaprio, I was very enthusiastic about this movie, i thought I was in for a ride.this movie was about dreams, so a perfect combination to be a masterpiece.This movie revolves around cobb(dicaprio), who is a skilled thief, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state. but this job had cost him everything he had ever loved. he is given a chance to get his old life back by saito(watanabe), in exchange of a job to be considered impossible. cobb takes it, assemble a team consisting of Arthur(levitt), Aridne(page), Eames(hardy), Yusuf(rao).but despite being a impossible task, nobody knows that their life is at risk because of a factor related to cobb's wife mal(cottilard).then the whole movie is about how they complete the job.the plot is fresh and exciting. the performances are brilliant. the movie is visually appealing, and demands active participation from viewers, which is good thing. the motive is good, but execution fails. the movie has brain , no heart.there is nothing to take back home after watching this movie except the complexity. also in the mid, you will know what the else is all about. this movie does not provide enough thrills, to consider it as a thriller. I am writing this review after such a time, because of such a hype this movie has got, which is not fair. we all know Nolan can do much better than this. I have seen all his movies, and he is certainly one of the best director alive. but he has to learn more from other such as Scorsese, movies are not all about technicality, there should be an emotion. movie should be able to teach something, and if the execution is able to does that, then the movie becomes a masterpiece, and an exception. Nolan has shown previously that he is capable of doing this in insomnia,the prestige, and batman trilogy.despite from all this, the movies has its moments.it fall shorts to become a masterpiece, and it hurts us.nolan has also continued his trademarks, leaving the ending to be interpreted by the viewer,....whether the cobb has return to the real world, or he is in the dreams at the end(cobb spins the top...but the top is not shown to stop and fall)."
23345,True,"I deeply believe that this is the masterpiece of modern cinematography. I am not to say whether this is the best movie of all time because it is more fitted to these times and way of living but without a doubt the viewer is left fully satisfied by the magnificent direction, plot and acting. Nolan sets a stunning atmosphere inside carefully designed dream worlds while manages to narrate the action and family story of the protagonist as they were totally necessary, interrelated parts of the complete puzzle.The most important attribute of this film is that it is going to make you think. You are not to miss a line if you want to keep up with the plot, but I believe that the really breathtaking fact is that this film elegantly depicts the dangers of our modern society, i.e. the need of modern man to build imaginary worlds (in front of a PC or a game console screen) in order to escape from his non-satisfying life. Simply brilliant!"
23346,True,"Inception, by Christopher Nolan, is a summer blockbuster that many people are walking out of, feeling absolutely blown away by 2.5 hours of high-budget special effects and shoot-'em-up action, and a seemingly intricate plot. People are talking about this film as a ""sophisticated, intelligent thriller"", having been thoroughly hypnotized by the bright colors, loud music and sound effects.We're interested in approaching popular culture to critique and engage. We simply didn't find much value in this movie. Here's why: 6.Glorification of Masculine Violence: Inception features millions of dollars in special effects, and is mostly men shooting at each other. Glorifying the violent male reinforces patriarchal patterns of violence. The film employs a few tricks to sneak by with a PG-13 rating: by placing almost all the violence in the ""dream world"" thus making it not ""real""; by having almost no blood in the film; and by having characters use a silencer for many of the gun battles (a classic James Bond trick). To Hollywood studios, including Warner Bros. which released Inception, celebrating fighting and killing is easy money. To the Motion Picture Association (an industry group in charge of rating movies for family consumption) marketing violence to kids is okay when the victims are ""projections"".5.No Originality: Inception borrows elements (like the ski chase, van chase, unlimited explosive charges, etc.) from action classics like James Bond, the Matrix and the Star Wars trilogy, but offers nothing original to the genre. The film' simple plot is boring despite the special effects. We were hoping for a characteristic Nolan plot twist at the end to save the film, but no such luck.4.Normalization of Violence: against Black People There is not a single speaking black character in the movie. A scene of gratuitous violence takes place in Mombasa, Kenya (actually shot in Tangiers, Morocco), a city full of black Africans. In the five minute Mombasa chase sequence, many black Mombasans are pushed out of the way by Leo or shot by his pursuers. The black character who appears for the longest time exists solely to lose a fight with Arthur in a hallway with shifting gravity. Images of violence against black bodies reinforce the racist dominant framework that this is routine and acceptable.3.Lack of Diversity: Out of a six-person dream infiltration team there are two male members of color and one white woman, but all of the impressive action is taken by the three white men. One man is a vaguely middle-eastern type, whose job it is to supply the drugs, and drive the van. He has few lines and displays no ability to fight beyond some shooting from the driver's seat of the van. The other is a benevolent Japanese capitalist who supplies the money and connections. Then once the action starts he gets shot right away, becoming dead weight for the other (white) characters and kept alive only to reunite DiCaprio's character with his family at the end. The lack of diversity is boring. Like all action films, this one has the potential to feature women and people of color in powerful roles, but conspicuously fails to do so.2.Cheerleading for Capitalism: The film attempts to construct a moral foundation for the operation of sneaking into a target's subconscious to plant an idea. The central mission of the team is to bring down a near-monopoly (the Fisher family's domination of the ""energy industry""), in favor of an oligopoly led ostensibly by the grandfatherly Japanese capitalist (Ken Watanabe) and a few other ""smaller"" companies. The message is that multiple companies in an industry creates competition, and thus is a check on corporate rule. In reality we see many corporations working together to profit from destructive resource extraction and exploitation of labor. The film attempts to persuade the audience to root for the victory of one corporation against another but fails to draw moral contrast between its protagonists and their target.1.Cliché Hetero-Monogamous Love Story: The motivations of our hero, Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) are based in a cheesy subplot about his relationship with wife and kids. The attempt to ""humanize"" Cobb, an otherwise violent character, essentializes both woman and children. The wife is jealous, scheming, and hysterical while the kids are faceless, silent and angelic. We like the spunk of Ariadne (Ellen Page), a smart and confident woman but she serves merely as a foil to Cobb whose wife, kids and crush, Ariadne, hold the whole emotional weight that the plot rests on. The films' dependence on a shallow emotional story weakens the plot and characters."
23347,True,"Inception (2:28, PG-13)  9  Science Fiction; biggie; original2009 was an amazing year for SF&F movies, with 7 original films (Avatar, District 9, Inglourious Basterds, Inkheart, Star Trek, Up, and Watchmen) getting my top rating of 9. 2010 so far has been disappointing, with only 4 (How To Train Your Dragon, Kick-Ass, Shrek Forever After, and Toy Story 3) getting as high as 8. But the dry spell is finally over, and in absolutely smashing fashion.Christopher Nolan has a grand total of 9 films to his credit, but they include such outstanding productions as Memento (2000), The Prestige (2006), and The Dark Knight (2008). Furthermore, in addition to directing, he co-wrote the screenplays for those movies with his brother Jonathan. They were marvels of intricacy, with layer upon layer of hidden meaning and nuance, slowly revealed as the story progressed. Now, as solo screenwriter and director, he has produced a masterpiece, the mind-blowing Inception.He takes an idea which I 1st read about in Douglas Hofstadter's Pulitzer Prizewinning 1979 book Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, and turns it into a riveting drama. Hofstadter wrote about a storyteller who gets his protagonist to a cliff-hanger point in a story, then has him start telling another story, which in turn leads to its own crisis, and then again, and then again. After the crisis is resolved at the final, deepest level, we go up and up and up again, and finally out. Only then does Hofstadter call our attention to the fact that we went down 4 levels but only came back up for 3 of them.Nolan uses this same idea (along with some Escherian visuals) with a wrinkle: It's not a story, it's a dream, and the dreamers are wired together so they share each others' experiences. Furthermore, there's a time-dilation effect (familiar to most people from their own dreams at least as far back as Mark Twain's ""The Great Dark"") in which an hour in dreamland is only 5 minutes in the real world. And if a person in dreamland goes into a deeper dream, the effect is compounded, so that a seeming lifetime can pass during only a short nap.In the near future, a small coterie of researchers has gotten good at this, and they make some shady money extracting hidden memories from the subconscious of people whose dreams they invade. Then a new proposition comes along. Wealthy power-company tycoon Saito (Ken Watanabe) wants to do the opposite  not to retrieve a memory but to plant one in the mind of Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy), the heir to the rival Fischer-Morrow Corp. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is confident it can be done, despite the misgivings of the rest of his team, but he warns that it will require going down multiple layers, for 2 reasons: (1) the new idea has to be so subtly insinuated that the target will think he came up with it himself, for reasons he would find credible, and (2) Fischer has undergone training to resist this very kind of dream incursion, and his subconscious comes equipped with alarms and security guards to snap him out of any ordinary dream state.But wait, there's more! Normally, when you're ""killed"" in a dream, you just wake up. But this endeavor involves not merely multiple levels but also a powerful anesthetic, and the combination means that anyone ""killed"" in dreamland will stay there forever, in a kind of limbo, lost to reality.And still more! Cobb's dead wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) shows up every time he enters dreamworld, whether he's the primary dreamer himself or piggybacking on someone else's. Even tho she's just a figment of his imagination, he's got a really GOOD imagination, and she has her own reasons for wanting to keep him in the dream state, so she's always trying to thwart his best-laid plans. So Cobb himself can't have TOO much knowledge, in his waking state, of whatever imaginary world they're planning to take the target into. But, while he recognizes this in himself and compensates for it, he has other blind spots that could endanger his entire team. Fortunately, he's engaged the brilliant young architect Ariadne (Ellen Page) to design his mazes for him, and she tumbles to some of his personal demons.But wait, there's STILL more And so it goes, layer upon layer, complexity atop complexity, and you start to think you shouldn't be able to tell the players without a scorecard, but somehow Nolan gives you just enuf visual cues to help you keep straight at least 4 simultaneous story threads, as he intercuts rapidly between them.It is a tour de force, the best SF&F movie of the year. It's not for slow learners, but anyone who's easily bored will have absolutely no problem staying awake. Indeed, after this, you may be reluctant to ever fall asleep again."
23348,True,"Some reviewers have credited this film with a high degree of originality, apparently because it explores the relationship between consciousness and reality. However, I can't agree. Admittedly, it has been unusual for really big mainstream blockbusters to tackle this theme, but The Matrix did get there first. Worse, explore off the beaten track even just a little and reality-bending plots become a commonplace. A few examples that randomly come to mind are: The Others, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, American Psycho, Memento, and anything by David Lynch. There must have been hundreds of such films, amongst whose company Inception hardly stands out in terms of inventiveness or wit.Again, some have seen profundity - a quality associated with the possession by a work of art of two or more layers of meaning. Whilst it is literally true that the plot of Inception has multiple (up to four) layers of action to follow at once, I don't think this is quite the same thing. I liked the idea of dreams-within-dreams-within-dreams, but a clever plot device does not lead to deep insight just because it demands concentration from the viewer.What I did like was the idea of an alternative reality that gets harder to escape from (maybe because you wouldn't want to?) the deeper one descends into it. British viewers may be reminded of the TV series ""Life on Mars"", in which a 2006 man enters a coma in which he experiences a fantasy-world set in the 1970s. On waking up he decides life in the past was better and commits suicide in the belief that by doing so he will return there. Inception explores this idea through the husband/wife relationship. Dramatic tension comes from the fact that husband Cobb ""wakes up"" to normal reality whilst wife Mal takes the opposite path. For me this was the film's best theme, well drawn out by effective use of flashbacks and plot twists.Less effective were the action scenes. The frequent switching between dream-layers made it tedious to keep up with what was meant to happening. Also, the plot devices used to explain how the layers were kept in synch felt contrived. Another problem with the action-stuff was that it mainly involved Cobb's gang, whose members never really come alive as characters, making it hard to care whether they got ""killed"" or not. (As to why he needs a gang in the first place, the less said the better).All-in-all this is an enjoyable cinematic experience, probably best enjoyed on the big screen and with critical faculties put on chill-out mode if not entirely switched off. If only Nolan had dispensed with the gang-of-buddies-kidnap-car-chase stuff (which never really came to life anyway) and focused on the core drama of Mol & Cobb, then this could have made a really good psychological thriller, enhanced as it was by big-budget actors and special effects."
23349,True,"In summary, if you consider yourself a seriously thinking individual who wants more than mindless explosions, then you will be dissatisfied with this movie. It is littered with flaws.Firstly the film is amoral. All of the characters are criminals, yet in this film the audience is encouraged to like them or at least ignore their shortcomings as if what they do is nothing more than unfortunate or a product of circumstances or society. Then there is the cavalier way in which a young girl is lured into a life of crime. Hey, but it's cool, so therefore okay! No its not! I can understand and believe that a university professor would happily introduce the girl to the criminal  basically, the professor is ""aiding and abetting"", and university lecturers are warping kids' minds to their own left-wing ideology every day, without a shred of guilt, so I can accept this professor's involvement in this perversion of the girl. But its offensive that the movie treats this as acceptable behavior. Then we are supposed to believe that DiCaprio's character can get the girl into one of his dreams without her knowledge  how that happened is never made clear. And then when she finds out that her mind has been violated, she doesn't really seem to mind. You'd think she'd be straight to the police. But supposedly the dream world is so alluring, that she doesn't mind that what they are proposing is illegal, a violation of someone else's mind, and that she's putting her trust in a criminal who had no qualms in violating her, and who is himself, psychologically and morally corrupt. Would a supposedly well-rounded girl really be that suicidal? A troubled, tattooed girl on the streets, struggling with a drug habit, might have been a more plausible character. But a clean cut girl attending University? Hopefully society hasn't sunk to that depth yet, where a girl of that background can be corrupted so easily and her exploitation then tolerated if not celebrated by the audience.Now onto some of the other flaws. One of the main faults, was that the van was hit and penetrated by multiple bullets over an extended period of time and only one person was wounded. We kept seeing shots of the van with bullets slamming into it, yet no one else is hit  even though the van is riddled with bullets and no panel left untouched. Most of the bullets went through the van, but in one scene a bullet hit the edge of the van door and hardly damage the paint. Some people seem to think that because it is a dream, anything can happen. So are there no rules? Wasn't the world designed in advance by the architect? Is the world supposed to be redesigned or altered in dream-time, and if so why did that guy get shot, and why couldn't he be healed instantly by the dreamer. There seemed to be many contradictions. Sometimes the worlds acted as if they were pre-defined and unalterable -- other than by the mind in whose head the dream was occurring, unconsciously fighting off the interference. But at other times the person who was dreaming seemed to be able to control everything. I'm also confused as to whose head was hosting each dream. How can a sequence of explosions in three different dreams be timed to such perfection that each goes off one after the other in sequence? Particularly without a sophisticated timing device (and when different dreams were being controlled by different people, if that was the case). DiCaprio seemed to work out the timing in his head. Nonsense. And the ski lodge scene was also unbelievable. The character was invincible, which led credence to the idea that it was his dream. But then if that was the case, why go to all of this trouble blowing up the building. The guy whose mind they were infecting, was dead or unconscious towards the end of the scene. So couldn't the dreamer just dream that the building drops off a cliff or is hit by an alien spacecraft or something equally preposterous. Since they made it so involved in causing the fall, I assume that the dreamer was limited in what they could do, and that is borne out by most of the dreams in the movie being constrained by real world consequences. So I think the dreamer was constrained as to what they could do, otherwise they wouldn't need the fuss trying to get an explosion to occur.The explosive charges weren't drilled into the reinforced concrete walls of the building, so the explosions wouldn't have destroyed the building. And then when the explosions occurred it is more likely that the upper story would have crashed down on their bodies, squashing them without any feeling of falling being involved.There are many more flaws in this movie: the Asian character that had been shot wakes up just at the right moment to lob a grenade down the tunnel; DiCaprio hasn't heard of the phone or email and so must travel the world to be his criminal cronies; there is too much shaky camera (the cinematographer hasn't heard of a steady cam; the dream within a dream concept is a rip off of the VR (virtual reality) worlds within worlds, that was done much better in the movie 13th Floor many years ago; there is none stop action that ends up being boring; we don't care about the characters or the main goal of the crime; dreams (or even memories) are presented in too much detail. My advice if you are someone who likes it when a movie hangs together, is to switch off your mind while you watch this movie and to accept that it makes little to no sense at all."
23350,True,"Leonardo DiCaprio stars in the movie i've been waiting for for over a year, Inception. And to tell you the truth, it was worth the wait. I waited so long, without knowing what it was about, because I know that any film that Christopher Nolan, who directed my favorite film The Dark knight, will blow my mind. And he does it. With his new masterpiece, Nolan has made one of my top three favorite films of all time. I haven't loved a film more since The Dark knight. There hasn't been a mind blowingly original film since Memento. Coincidently, they are from the same director. Inception is one of the greatest movies ever made. It's the best film of the year, it is going to be overall. It is probably going to be the best film of the decade, and the decades to come.Now, how do I describe it? Dom Cobb(played by Leonardo Dicaprio) has the ability to enter a person's dreams and steal secrets from that. Him and his team(which includes Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Dileep Rao, and Tom Hardy) do that. Inception is when you plant an idea in somebody's head. Some of them believe it's a myth. Cobb knows it isn't though. He knows it exists. And that is what Cobb and his team try to do.There is more to the plot than that. There are things involving Cobb's wife Mal(played excellently by Marion Cotillard) and Robert Fischer Jr.(played by Cillian Murphey, another Nolan regular). But to tell you the truth, I can't exactly explain it. It's very complex, and too smart, and i'd be ashamed to explain this film.I'd be ashamed to explain it,because it's too brilliant. It took Christopher Nolan ten years to write it. I can see how. It took me over a year to see it. And it will probably take me more than once to understand it fully.There hasn't been a film that i've loved more since The Dark knight. Inception is on my top three favorite movies. It's the most original, emotionally complex,complex,emotional, visually exhilarating,brainy,and well shot motion picture in years.The ending is brilliant. Nolan has almost outdone himself. I would say it's almost as good as The Dark knight. I have loved all of Nolan's films. Inception, The Dark knight and The Prestige are all on my top five.Nolan has never shot a better film.This is his best thriller. It's like films like Vanilla sky but it blows them away. Though I liked that movie. Inception is the best movie of the year.It will remain the best movie of the year. It will most likely be my favorite film of the decade. and the decades to come. I guess that is until another Nolan movie comes out. Because he is a director that has a specialty in blowing our minds and outdoing himself.Inception is an amazing movie that will probably get better within repeated showings. You won't find a better film this Summer. Screw those Toy story 3 lovers(though I loved it too).Inception is fantastic.Inception:A+++++++"
23351,True,"'Inception' has already been defined by its makers as a mixture of James Bond and 'The Matrix'. I was hoping that it would be more, and it was, but not as much as I would have liked it to be.Conceptually it was fascinating. Dreams are fascinating in themselves, and the idea of being able to enter and manipulate the sub-conscious has been around for awhile in movies: 'A Nightmare on Elm Street', 'Dreamscape', 'The Cell', and 'What Dreams May Come'. The best of these is 'The Cell', which spins a horrific tale. Yet, as a dream-concept film it is the most visually interesting because it gives us the kind of abstractions that are associated with dreams; abstractions that can make sub-conscious sense, particularly to the dreamer. 'Inception' initially depicts some dream abstractions, but conveniently overrides this by introducing the 'dream architect' whose job it is to make the dream as real as possible. As a result, as our actors jump through dream levels, in which there are four (psychology has determined there are primarily two sub-conscious levels) we observe commonsensical realities - for the most part. Although this is significant to storyline development, it unfortunately means that we are left with familiar visuals (chase scenes and shoot'em- ups) that merely differ from level to level. Soon we find ourselves watching two to four recognizable action scenarios that are implied to be transpiring simultaneously.Since this can present the possibility of confusion for the viewer, the film often becomes visually redundant and subsequently monotonous. This was the major flaw of the film, so much so that I almost nodded off. Myself. Yet, the concept of the film overrides this flaw, and much of the imagery is particularly stunning."
23352,True,"I had a review all written up but after reading many others, most of what blows about this film has been covered. I'll keep it brief.However, I didn't put much faith into a review from anyone who didn't like it but uses a phrase something like, ""maybe I'm just not clever enough..."" That kind of sentiment pretty much speaks for itself. It has some good ideas but then hell, so do I. I have some great plot devices and mind-benders. But there's the problem of writing a story with interesting characters and dialogue and conflict and resolution and...you get it? Nolan has the plot devices and the mindbleep ending and a bunch of Crisco® in between.I agree with others who have stated in their reviews, if he was willing to broach this subject he should have done more research and dug a little deeper. The possibilities were endless and I was hoping for something far more challenging. Then again based on the returns, I guess this was the way to go. Meat for men and milk for babes. This film is milk."
23353,True,"Definitely not a 9 out of 10, or a top 250 movie. I have an idea, let's fabricate a semi-comprehensible plot which is grounded so feebly in reality that it's meaning can be subject to anyone's interpretation. Therefore critics will refuse to pan it out of fear of being perceived as idiots, the public will refuse to criticize it out of fear of being perceived as shallow, and everyone else will wonder what they've missed. Oh, and to top the cupcake with a cherry, we'll deliver an ending which offers no resolution. It can't fail! The concept of reality vs. fantasy was definitely better delivered in The Matrix...and this movie is not its equal or even a strong competitor. The concept of dream invaders was dealt with much more enjoyably in Dreamscape (1984), and was much easier to comprehend. This movie was more of an enigma burrito wrapped in a layer of fantasy tortilla, topped with sour-cream special effects, and hyped by popular salsa. Get it? Only the most hippest and most intelligent can understand my allegorical comparison!"
23354,True,"Inception is unquestionably the jewel in the crown among all the movies Nolan has directed till date. He has taken the non-linear narrative style and turned it into an art form.Nolan takes a complex plot and deconstructs it in a way that makes the movie flow simple, elegant and interesting.Dom is an unusual thief. He and his team specialize in extracting memories of confidential information by entering a dream state along with the victim, quite literally entering their mind. Dom is also a fugitive, accused of being responsible for his wife's death.This results in his subconscious mind being unstable because he cannot reconcile with being separated from his wife. Professional and personal life clash when he is asked to implant an idea in a victim's mind rather than steal it, the prize being a chance to redeem himself and meet his children again. This process, called Inception is extremely tricky and quite risky. In spite of the risk involved, Dom assembles his team and enters the victim's dream state but his unstable mind and risky nature of the job gives rise to unexpected situations. What happens to Dom and his team, is he able to vanquish his personal demons and will he reunite with his family forms the rest of the story.The story is simple but the idea of entering the dream state and the associated details make it complex. There is also the emotional complexity of Dom as he goes through the painful process of reconciling with his past. But Nolan has done an awesome job, making the movie understandable, engaging and edge of the seat. Truly a spectacular effort.And a religious experience."
23355,True,"Nolan has done it again...There are just so many movies that are made such a hype about but so few that actually live up to that hype...and Inception does that and more!! The Star cast is so well picked out and each one has played their parts outstandingly! (A special mention for Tom Hardy) DiCaprio was just as great as he is in all of his movies, he's my favorite actor of all time and can't wait for his next! And Oh, the MUSIC....JUST WOW!!! You may however think the movie is just a bit slow, but worth it in the end!! The last scene alone makes the movie worth watching twice at least!!"
23356,True,"I must admit that the first time I saw Inception, I was surprised, it is after all a complex movie, however after repeated views I've realized that even though complex, it is not focused at all.By now, most of the people reading this review already saw the movie and as the high rating on IMDb reveals, most of the readers liked the movie. And in all honesty the first time or two times I saw it I liked it too, but as I said before repeated views, reveal the incoherent, pretentious, even ridiculous defects of the movie.The main one (and my biggest complaint) being the ''main plot'' of the movie, completely amoral, simple and without depth nor real development. There is no reason at all for the viewer to root for the main cast, when they are ruining one guy's life just or the sake of helping other to make more money. The ''heroes'' are anti-heroes or just true villains, they are thieves, criminals and the only redeeming quality, that is Cob's (DiCaprio's character) wish to see his children again, is in the end just a dream, an illusion. I don't think that every movie should have a heavy load of morals, however including true redeeming qualities adds depth and layers to the script and the characters, here we have 1 dimensional characters that spit lines of dialog without truly adding something to the plot, just for the sake of making the ''Heist Movie'' more interesting. And one last thing, shame on you mister Nolan for bringing such great actors like Tom Berenger and especially Michael Caine to recite 3 lines in the entire movie, shame on you.1/10 And that's because I cannot put a 0 on it. Yes the technical aspects of the movie are superb, however not even that saves this movie, unlike Avatar, that the visuals, do carry the whole movie."
23357,True,"Christopher Nolan will surely be crowned the god of film making with this one. This movie is perfect in all areas of film making the writing, the direction, the acting, the cinematography. You will want to watch it again once you have watched it. Chris Nolan wrote the script so intelligently without any loop holes ( at I didn't find any) and then presented it on screen in his own mind teasing way. The acting by Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt,Ellen Page and Cillian Murphy is simply flawless. The BGM by Hans Zimmer makes you lose yourself and immerse yourself into the movie.And folks this is not a copy of the Japanese animated movie paprika. It is not a copy of paprika at any level at all. But if you want to argue that the whole concept of going into other people's dreams has been stolen from paprika then you are mistaken. The concept of going into other people's dreams has already been used in a 1984 Dennis Quaid movie called Dreamscape. So eff off and watch the movie and lose yourself in this Christopher Nolan masterpiece. Can't wait for the blu ray to come out but of course I can't stop myself from going to the cinema hall watching it as many times as possible. As the blu ray will take a long time to come out."
23358,True,"I felt like I was in a dream within a dream as I sat back in my comfy movie theater seat and sank into the multiple dream worlds of Mr. Leonardo di Caprio. If you're a big fan of mazes and word search, then you'll be thrilled and horrified by Inception. A jauntily bescarfed Miss Ellen Paige joins a crack team of serious-faced crazy dream thieves who forget to tell her certain rules and regulations until after they're inside the dream. Or maybe it was another dream within a dream, I'm not sure and I can't remember. How many times I've forgotten to tell people important things too, until it's too late. This happens at work frequently. So I understand Miss Paige's nervousness and excitement, but luckily she is more than skilled enough to figure out how the heck someone can wiggle their way into Mr. Di Caprio's personal dreams and pointlessly stare at the zit on Miss Marianne Cotillard's French forehead. Confusion? Sure! Irritation? Guaranteed. Pointless gunfights? You ask for it, you got it. But as long as you can remember that 10 minutes in real life equals four hours in the dream world, you'll be happy as a clam as you watch a Ford Econoline van take nearly two hours to fall into the water. It's a fun time for all. Realistic yet completely unrealistic at the same time. Where's my totem? I can't tell if I'm in a dream or a nightmare when I watch Inception!"
23359,True,I am a big fan of Nolan since a couple of years! I have seen all of his movies so far! I even loved Doodlebug a lot. in those 2:30 minutes he proves his worth! But with Inception I thought he might become commercial like all other big directors do!! BUt guess what he has improved on himself... and by adding comedy to the film he has become versatile enough to become the best director ever!! Hans Zimmers' music is another reason the movie is so exciting!! Just like Dark Knight and Batman Begins the music makes you feel more tensed! I would say after The Prestige(its no.1 on my list) this is the best work of Nolan! Note:- If Inception doesn't get an Academy Award for Best Direction then seal the fact the awards suck!!
23360,True,"The Best director and The best Casting Specially Leonardo DiCarpio and Tom Hardy. Firstly the movie starts with the great Twist. After that story begins.The movie is about a story of Thief and his Team who steal secret information through Dreams of the Victims. Actually the theme of this movie is about the dreams. There is lots a of real facts about dreams and I have never seen such a great movie about dreams.Leonardo Plays a main part.He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.Actually I have no words for this movie.Once the film ends, you'll want to watch it again, for there's something new every time.I highly recommended to everyone to watch this great movie."
23361,True,"People were telling for months before I watched it how unbelievably amazing this film is. Anyone who says so is MISTAKEN. This film is pure bullshit. So they're in a dream within a dream within a dream and if they die in any of those dreams they'll never wake? Seriously!? The whole premise is utterly pointless and I couldn't care less about any of the characters. I guess with this films high rating on IMDb that most people really enjoyed it so my viewpoint is probably unpopular. If I hadn't had a Dozen different people tell me how amazing it was before I'd seen it I might not have thought quite as shockingly bad, but even so this film is a seriously poor effort and doesn't begin to compare with Momento."
23362,True,"I will say there were some amazing special effects, and action scenes, but overall, ""Inception"" left me bored. This is most likely due to the fact that the movie is close to nothing but 3 hours of fending off enemies that are nothing but nameless faceless ""white blood cells"" defending the subconscious. It just felt like it dragged on forever. That along with the fact that I felt zero attachment to the characters in the movie and an overly ridged dreamscapes made this film feel horridly sterile. Not to mention, the film felt very jumpy. As in it jumps from scene to scene to scene every few minutes. In fact, the film may have been trying to pull off a feat so grand, that it leaves you thinking its all just a big jumbled mess not worth the frustration of following. I can deal with a complex film, but I feel that the jumping around to all the scenes occurring simultaneously made the film lose focus. In other words, I watched the movie play out, but it did not pull me into it. I was a detached viewer, no emotional involvement whatsoever. On top of that, the film was honestly very predictable and had very little in the revelation department. You could always see the tracks before the train went over them so to speak. One aspect of the movie that just completely dumbfounded me was that the film managed to be both imaginative, yet uncreative at the same time. There is so much potential for creativity in a movie about dreaming, but this film decided to make the dreams seem more like virtual reality then actual dreams.However, the biggest disappointment of this movie is the fact that everyone claimed it was an intelligent thinking mans film. This film has not exercised one bit of critical thinking in my mind. It feels overly superficial and hardly a film that can spark deep philosophical debate. After watching ""Inception"" it did not have me contemplating the big questions in life one bit. When it ended, it ended, and that was that."
23363,True,"Big hype movie with big money stars - OK, you already have your audience coming in the doors of the theaters and will probably make budget the first weekend. So how do you get them to keep coming back, rent this and buy it even? How about you make it soooo complicated that a post graduate English major cannot even decipher the scrambled plot line on first review? Yep!This film is FILLED with awesome special effects, yes most certainly. However, are there not some people who actually care about following a plot? I asked three people under 25 who saw this movie if they liked it and they all said ""yes!!"" However, when I asked them to explain it to me they ALL said that they really didn't understand it but it looked sooo cool. Well, is that what a movie is now? ""I don't understand what it was about but it was really cool how those buildings bent and ..."" Go see the Grand Canyon. Visit Old Faithful. Get off the couch if you want to ""see"" something spectacular. I get it - yeah, cool special effects. But someone explain to me how you do not wake up in a dream within a dream if you get startled in your first dream. While I may be one of the very few, I expect my movie to make some sort of logical, even if very extremely far fetched, sense. Inception? Not exceptional-"
23364,True,"The film is everything, that Hollywood almost always does wrong; It is technically brilliant, but that's all there really is. There is a huge rush to every new ""turn"" on the plot, which in reality is repetition of the first ""turn"" all the way through. This film has one little idea stretched to 2½ hours. There is nothing surprising during the whole movie. Within the first ½ hour, you'll just know exactly what will be. Very, very boring. The characters are just paper images that do not have a single feeling showing from their faces through the whole movie that you could relate to which would be necessary to make it all even a little bit credible. The acting is very shallow, acting is marionette like; it just serves the goal of a very mediocre director. This is a action movie and not even a decent one. The excuse for constant gunfire and violence is one of the most miserable i've ever seen. In a dream everything is like a action movie all the time!? The custodial path the director takes to explain everything to the audience is just ridiculous. And the rules the director so carefully explains doesn't even concern himself! It seems to me that this movie has been tailored exactly for the target audience of 10-15 years old teenagers who do not care about any foundation. Just for the sake of the limping plot he decides when to follow the rules and when not! Example so that the fans don't have to bother them selves to think; The wake up method; when the van falls, director just decides, they do not wake up (althoug it is earlier made very clear, that this (feeling of falling) is a rock solid method to wake up the dreamers), because he (director/writer) isn't ready yet, so we'll just wait for the van to hit the water, oh my... This just is one of the most embarrassing moments in the movies ever, it destroys the whole idea once and for all. For technical merits, including the apparent complexity of the film, which only consists of couple of parallel dream layers, otherwise it totally useless to search any complexity or layers from the film, they are purely superficial and then the special effects and staging(which are nothing new by the way) i'll give this 3/10, other than that there is really nothing to see or feel about this disaster of a film. Compare to Matrix, which also trips up with it's own cleverness a bit but still manages to transmit the feeling and idea, even a bit philosophical one, to the audience. Something the ""Inception"" never managed to deliver."
23365,True,"First I would like to say that I would strongly recommend you read some of the reviews *before* you watch the movie. Several one-star reviews are very well written and help set expectations. Having done that, and sort of knowing what to expect, I found I was less confused when I finally saw (rented) the movie. That said, it clearly did not live up to its potential. The special effects and overall visuals are incredible. There's no denying that. The ""why"" behind some of the visuals and effects can be confusing however. If it's taking place inside a dream, where literally anything is possible, why the complicated trek across a frozen landscape, several dream-layers deep, to some strange vault, for example? Or why wasn't the van bulletproof, or equipped with some neat Bond-type gadgets? Why use a van at all ... it's a dream, why not use an armored military vehicle? Real dreams virtually never consist of contiguous or linear events either. Going from Point A to Point C never implies first having to stop at Point B, although in this movie we are led to believe that is a requirement. Other 'laws' are less stringent but inconsistent - you could awaken from the dream state if you die, or you could end up in 'limbo', depending on where you are in the storyline. There are aspects of the plot that should have been better explained, or developed, such as the concept of 'limbo' itself, or Ariadne's background and why she was so 'special'. Overall it was a disappointment, and although clearly over-hyped, it is not the worse movie ever. It's not one you would want to watch a 2nd time, unless of course it's being reviewed by Tom Servo & Crow on the set of MST3K ! :-)"
23366,True,"The movie that seems to be on the tip of everybody's tongue this summer is Inception. It is one of those cross-over movies that receives critical acclaim (possibly making it eligible for a best movie Oscar) and public adoration (possibly making it eligible to make lots of money). I have heard numerous high-brow critics love it (87% on Rotten Tomatoes) and countless Facebook comments saying how cool and weird and incomprehensible it is.And I, of course, don't get it.Don't get mad or get me wrong. I enjoyed the film a lot and good filmmaking  nowhere near Oscar worthy  but very good. It reminded me of Oceans 11 or Oceans 13, not Oceans 12. My question for the general public is ""What made it so confusing?"" They spend the first hour of the film explaining everything that is about to happen. You are well equipped with dream terminology like a ""kick"" or how dreams inside of dreams work. We already know about Leo's inner demons and we understand how time operates different in dreamland.In fact, I cannot remember a movie that explained itself so well. And I liked this about the movie. But based upon all the hype, I was waiting for the big twist. And it never came! I thought that maybe the whole movie was a dream of Leo's character. Or maybe, it was the wife who was alive and Leo that was dead. Again, what was so weird about the movie that it would need several viewings to understand? Was it the ending? Please! The end just substantiates the main philosophical question about the movie: perhaps our definition of 'reality' should not be so concrete. But the ending works because the viewer will perceive the reality of the situation based on what they took out of the movie. Why does the movie have to give you an answer? The director, Christopher Nolan, made Memento and The Prestige and those films, I would argue, created much more confusion (especially Memento) than Inception. Nevertheless, I want to emphasize that I enjoyed the film and I think Nolan should be proud of his effort. But it didn't leave that indelible impact upon me like a Donnie Darko or Fight Club or Magnolia or Syriana.Perhaps the answer lies within what I call the ""movie review relativity scale."" Woody Allen's worst movies are better films than James Cameron's best. Yet, a reviewer will score it poorly if it does not rise to his high standards. I think when a summer blockbuster is layered, as this movie is, and creates some semblance of character depth, albeit just with Leo's character, we get excited-crazy-go-nuts.""I went to see an action film, but I had to sorta pay attention a bit. It was awesome!"" No, it was not awesome, but hopefully it can serve as a rabbit hole to explore more interesting movies like Memento or Dogville or countless other films in which you do have to pay attention for longer than a Youtube video."
23367,True,"Never in all this years i've been surfing on IMDb site, did i feel so compelled to write a review. I'm just remaining completely puzzled in front of the plethora of eulogistic reviews you can find here. I mean, people, did we really watch the same movie ?OK, FX are great, OK, scenes are well cut, and, OK, I do believe too Leonardo Di Caprio is a good actor (but with some movies like ""blood diamond"", ""shutter island"" it's not exactly like it's a ground breaking piece of news...)But no, sorry, this movie is anything but original. The two bonded questions ""are we all dreaming or is this the real world"" and ""is living in reality better than living in a dream"" have been discussed numerous times, and with more success i do believe (Vanilla sky, matrix, etc...)Anyway it was apparently not Mr Nolan point to explore in depth this thematic, since even the vaguely original concept of the movie, ""the multi layers dreams"" seems to be there only to enable more completely out of context action scenes (how sad would it be to think our subconscious can only dream of gunshots and James Bond scenes to resolve inner conflicts...)And what should we think about the completely grotesque set of rules we're given to explain this multi layer system ? I mean, even I, who do love science fiction and is used to accept new ""reality frames"" found it very hard to swallow it. For example, when in a dream layer, one can be put into a sublayer using the same device... How in the world should one's subconscious know how to react to an oniric version of the device ??? And it keeps going this way during all the movie : so much for action scenes, so few for the mind. Finally, there are only a few minutes left to really develop the oh so catchy movie premise : ""what's the most resilient form of a parasite? An idea""...Well, since I've left the movie theater, an idea was indeed planted in my brain, the following one : That I've rarely seen such a self indulgent movie. I've come to watch a movie promising to explore the kingdom of human subconscious and we've come back home having watched just another action movie, a good one for this category, but definitely not a revolutionary movie deserving to rank 3rd in IMDb top 250..."
23368,True,"...then perception becomes reality, I guess.BUT, I would like to throw my vote in with those whose brains continued to function beyond the slick promotions for this film, beyond the hype-machine that this film managed to become, beyond the silly ""word of mouth"" that the awestruck, dumbstruck numb-skulls of social media spewed forth.This movie was, first and foremost, B-O-R-I-N-G. Nothing, not one single thing, was ever at stake or in danger of being lost. This is not a movie about some depressed guy's journey toward redemption or retirement or whatever - it's about corporate espionage, first and foremost. That always gives ME the shivers! zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz And no, Leo's consciousness or sanity or whatever was never really in danger. Nope. Sure, he was still in the dream. No, you shouldn't care. It doesn't matter. Why? It was a dream. A dream. JUST a dream.That leads me to my second point: if there is this amazing technology that (1) lets people consciously dive in and share a mutual dream, and (2) lets there be so much control that it can even be designed in minutest detail, then (3) Leo won't stay trapped in his dream because you can always design a way to go in and drag him back out.The magical mutual dream device is so patently absurd that there isn't even a single second's attempt to explain it - it just is what it is. We're supposed to accept it at face value. That's the director leading us down the road to accepting Leo's fate at face value, too. It's a classic trick of narrative conditioning.Anyway, just for the sake of argument, what if they couldn't design him back out of the dream? What's the deal with the totem? That thing was an arbitrary failsafe. Why is it the *only* failsafe? Are we really expected to buy that? When something as important as your consciousness on the line? There's no backup plan for figuring out what state you're in? Whaaaaaaaaat???But, back to my main point: B-0-R-I-N-G.And why didn't they shoot the wife every single time she showed up? Are you kidding me? If they would've done that, I might have stayed interested and been willing to swallow the rest. Leo has to deal with the pain of loss over and over because his teammates have brains and balls and cap that lady before she can do her damage, and Leo goes all Jack Nicholson by the end. THAT would've been something to see.This movie, though, was not something to see.If you do want to see real 9 out of 10 stars movie about dreams, go watch Paprika (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0851578/), which of course doesn't get 9/10 on this site. But every vote counts!!"
23369,False,"What is the most resilient parasite? An Idea! Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?Dom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!But then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: 'Inception'Then what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobb's 'brainiac' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a ""forger"" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier. There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.Leonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! what a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category. If ""Inception"" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.To conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan! My Rating: 10/10Thanks & Regards"
23370,False,"Dom Cobb leads a highly skilled team, specializing in stealing secrets from people's minds by entering their dreams. When they are hired by a mysterious businessman, Cobb finally has a shot at redemption, but not before achieving the near impossible. Rather than stealing an idea, they must do the complete opposite: Inception. Planting the seed of an idea.Inception has a multi-layered plot, quite literally in fact. It focuses on the emotional journey of its lead character, Cobb, but at the same time thrusts the audience into multiple levels of action packed story- telling, very distinct from one another, but all finely connected. It has been described by critics as ""a film that rewards intellect"", and I can assure you that it is exactly that. Director Christopher Nolan challenges the audience to keep up, and rewards those who can with a breathtaking spectacle, one that has the capability to leave you awestruck. The best part about it is that while you may feel you need to watch it again to be able to fully absorb the experience, chances are, you will probably want to.Christopher Nolan brings his unique vision to the screen with the help of a star-studded cast, including the likes of Leonardo Dicaprio (The Departed), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (500 Days Of Summer), Ellen Page (Juno), Marion Cotillard (Public Enemies), Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins), and Michael Caine (The Dark Knight), as well some amazing photography by long time collaborator Wally Pfister. The thrilling music in the film is provided by none other than Hans Zimmer, who was also set the mood for Nolan's previous film, The Dark Knight.While it may seem simple at its outset, Inception is an extremely complex film, delving deep into the subconscious of the human mind. Technical brilliance and visual splendor have rarely blended together as beautifully. The emotional depth and explosive action complement each other perfectly, delivering a film that is at the same time both heart- wrenching and heart-pounding. It's a film that manages to engross you with its complexities, yet comes together seamlessly, and will have you at the edge of your seat, quite literally from start to finish.Inception is magnificent."
23371,False,"I saw Memento very recently, something that turned out to be a great miss.I saw it again, just to make a couple of thins straight-and i'll definitely do the same with Inception.Christopher Nolan keeps improving himself, with even more complex and multilayer script like this.And i thought Memento was hard to reach by most of the viewers, but no.Inception will keep you mesmerized and captivated by the genius, that's hidden behind it.And not just directors and screenwriters (or with other words-Nolan), but with acting and sound-and effects and editing as well.When you have a cast like this-i mean Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Michael Caine, or Marion Cotillard (a personal favourite), the movie just keeps going flawlessly.Most of the crew is the same the Nolan brothers worked with on TDK and earlier in Batman Begins.So the Oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for me.The only thing one could have against the movie, is the headache one could have.See, most of my friends go to the movies for brainless action, they enjoyed Iron Man 2 and The A-Team, but this movie-you have to see it at least twice, to understand it.The levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many, that one surely'll miss something vital.This is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience, but i hope that won't happen, because Nolan is one of my favourite directors/writers, and he showed, that the brainless action flicks aren't all of it.There are still movies like Inception out there and still people like the Nolans to make those movies, so it's not all lost.And i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is still important for the experience one could receive, not the endless, constant explosions.Because this is really a one of a lifetime event.Saying that, i must say, that in a world full of remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels and God knows what, this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched so far-a strong movie, that, surely will be Nolan's latest masterpiece! My Grade won't change-it's the same for all Nolan movies-sheer 10!"
23372,False,"Inception is written, produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Dileep Rao, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine. The musical score is by Hans Zimmer and Wally Pfister is the cinematographer. Plot finds DiCaprio playing Dom Cobb, a specialised spy for hire who steals ideas from the dreams of people. But one day he gets a different offer, one that will enable him to see his estranged children. To get his reward he must enact Inception, the planting of an idea in the mind of the selected target. But Inception is thought impossible and should Cobb and his selected team fail? The consequences are unthinkable.There has already been much written and pondered about as regards Inception in the relatively short running time of its life. One can only imagine what will be written and said about it in ten years time. For although it's arguably a bit too early to be talking about it being held in such high regards as the likes of 2001: A Space Odyssey, it's inescapable that Nolan's movie is this current generation's sci-fi classic. That Nolan has managed to make it accessible to the mainstream, and dazzled the eyes as much as the brain in the process, is close to being a piece of genius craftsmanship.Inception is a film that it's better to know nothing about before venturing into it, and then it asks, well Nolan asks, for your undivided attention. It's neither as confusing as some have painted it, nor does it have any tricks-peek behind the curtain type-up its sleeve. The truth is is that Inception has something for everyone; thematically speaking, and that's before we pore over the special effects that sees Nolan raising the bar considerably. As is the case with twisty high concept movies, interpretations are many, with the director rightly abstaining from discourse about his movie. What forms the basis is your basic life and death struggles, with the grey areas during and after given a clever cinematic make over. There's also meditations on grief that this reviewer personally found easy to get involved with; that of course wont work for everyone, but that is just one of many strands that Nolan dangles for the discerning viewer.If that all sounds a bit too serious for the man who has redefined the Super Hero genre, rest assured thrill seekers, Inception is also a loud swirly spectacle. The action is raucous, be it gun fights or zero gravity punch ups, Nolan has not lost the ability to take the viewer on an action fuelled roller-coaster ride, aided superbly by Lee Smith's editing and Pfister's perfectly broad photography While Zimmer's score blends electronic action pulse beats with saddened guitar strains (ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr on 12 string) to craft one of the best scores of 2010. As I said, there's something for everyone here, making it perhaps one of the leading nominees for title of ultimate modern day blockbuster.Then there's the strong ensemble cast, led by a quite scintillating performance from DiCaprio. Following on from his cards played close to his chest turn in Shutter Island, DiCaprio has given 2010 two of its best lead performances. Here he gives real depth of emotion, the kind that makes it easy for the viewers to hang their hats on. His unfussy acting is easy to buy into, giving the character the air of believability, he is the glue that binds the whole film together. Murphy is wonderfully vulnerable, very much an axis in the narrative, while Levitt almost usurps DiCaprio with a neatly layered portrayal that carries a delightful whiff of duality about it. Special praise, too, for Ellen Page. Still in her early 20s, she exudes an intelligent sexiness that shines bright in a role that could have been boorishly played as a cipher in a lesser actress' hands. While Hardy provides brawny levity and Berenger leaves a favourable mark.The Matrix meets Heat and Mission Impossible, only it's written by Phillip K. Dick and Richard Matheson; or something like that. A cracking hybrid movie that's fit to grace any summer and sure to improve and enlighten with further viewings. 9.5/10"
23373,False,"Inception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan's mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly intelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As Nolan himself has been reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind, if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then trust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology (although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then Inception is seminal in it's storytelling. With a 148 minute running time, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn't expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left. I was simply blown away by the depth in every single part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect of the film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don't worry. They are, as hinted in the trailer, incredible, looking real and unbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action set pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story, rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay.With this complex movie in it's high concept, a stellar cast is needed. And Nolan as always, delivers with just that. This is vintage DiCaprio, perhaps only equalled in The Aviator, which is even more impressive as his role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one, needing DiCaprio to be the constant at the centre of the film. And he pulls off Cobb's emotional contradictions sublimely. The rest of the cast members all shine in parts of the films, Cillian Murphy shows off his usually non-existent tender side, Gordon-Levitt bottles his usual charm for his confidently reserved turn as the reliable Arthur, Watanabe is devilish as the seemingly ambiguous Saito, Page shows why she's the next big female star and Tom Hardy revels in being the comic relief of the film compared to his recent turns as decidedly psychopathic characters.Overall, Nolan has indeed surpassed himself. He has created a world as expansive as his Gotham, a plot dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and one which blows The Prestige's cinematic reveal out of the water. This is truly unmissable cinema. Revel in it, we've still got to wait a whole two years before Batman 3."
23374,False,"Usually I try to be careful with over hyping a film, or setting the expectations too high, as film geeks all are guilty for, however for Christopher Nolan's Inception, this really is not possible.This is possibly one of the only perfect films I have ever seen. It is absolutely confident in every way, something which is extremely refreshing, even more so than Avatar. Christopher Nolan gets some slack for making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs, which I for one do not agree with, however I do not think anyone can argue that here. The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together but is really the centre of this film, it is the focus. I do not want to over simplify the film, by simply calling it Kubrick doing Bond, or Gondry on a huge budget, because I am sure it will be called that but it is far more than that, it is something I do not think Kubrick could have ever made. It is pure Nolan, and pure greatness.I hate writing something which is pure fan-boy gushing, but its really difficult here. I did not find a thing I did not like about it, I am sure if maybe I saw it a second time, maybe I would find something about it I didn't like, but not the first time. The way it is cut, means that there is always action on screen, if not, then the visuals are interesting enough to keep your eyes glued.The final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated action sequences put on film. You have to constantly be paying attention to remember all of the layers of what is happening. Without spoiling anything, all I have to say is that is what this film is about, that is what makes this film so great, layers. Once you have seen this you will now what I am talking about.All of the actors are fantastic too, Di Caprio is the stand out here. Yes, this is probably due to the fact he is the star and given all of the emotional weight, but he handles it perfectly, similarly to his performance in Shutter Island. Ellen Page, whom I usually hate, gives a great performance here. Tom Hardy gives a break out performance here, he is quite the bad ass.I hope audiences are ready for a film like this, a pure auteur driven film which does not sacrifice a single frame for the studio. I would hope this film will change Hollywood, as it is 100 percent the directors vision yet it is definitely a marketable film, much like District 9, yet I do not think it will. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. Sorry about all the gushing, it is just so hard not too.If you liked this review check out my new film blog: http://thedeletedscene.wordpress.com"
23375,False,"I had the privilege of seeing this movie before it came out, and, like most of DiCaprio's films, it blew me away.Inception is a well-made movie, filmed in about 6 locations all over the world. The directing was outstanding, there were only about two moments, maybe three seconds in total, where i noticed that visual effects were being used (of course defying gravity is pretty difficult). The plot was very pleasingly intricate, with a twist-and-turn, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel. I noticed that this film had similarities with DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island (which i also enjoyed very much)seeing as it left you wondering what was real and what was not. It's great to see a movie with a thick and emotional plot and not just grenade-throwing action heroes who achieve greatness in the end.Inception also has a very well-composed score, which to me was the finishing touch to a perfect movie. If you're thinking about seeing Inception, definitely go! Even though i was fortunate enough to see a free show, it is worth every penny you pay. Truly unique, like nothing i've ever seen before. Christopher Nolan certainly covered new ground with this film and wasn't afraid to leave us hanging with a spectacular ending."
23376,False,"I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to ""The Dark Knight"", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film ""Paprika"" in the whole ""invading dreams"" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it's either all-visuals-no-smarts (""G.I. Joe"", ""Transformers"") or the exact opposite (""Doubt"", ""Invictus""). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan's perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can't explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It's like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film's humanity, and this is where ""Inception"" shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That's right, years.Once the film ends, you'll want to watch it again, for there's something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film's ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (""Avatar"" be damned).Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort ""Shutter Island"". He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (""The Dark Knight""). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie's quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer's complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that's really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And ""Inception"" can proudly stand alongside ""Blade Runner"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.Missing this film and not getting the film's point is a crime.Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent)"
23377,False,"Surrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre, or inquisitively titillating, depending purely on the viewer's intellect. Though the realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex, but even a slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a Pandora's Box, making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible. This facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors, but not to the genius of Christopher Nolan, who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism, but also ingeniously blends it with the elements of Science Fiction in his latest wonder named Inception. Nolan created a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie called Memento. He further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like Insomnia, The Prestige, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. His unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag, which gave him the carte blanche that a story-teller like Nolan desperately needs. It's highly apparent that Nolan takes every possible advantage of this liberty while filming Inception. Inception is not only dreamlike, but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other thing conceived on the silver screen. With its entwined layers, the movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes multiple viewing extremely essential. It incredibly does extremely well on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts. In fact, the balance between human emotions and the elements of Science Fiction is so adequate that it's impossible to separate them. The movie is about a futuristic world where the human mind can be intercepted through dream invasion. Cobb is an expert in the art of extracting information (stealing valuable secrets) from deep within the subconscious in the dream state. His proficiency in extraction is marred by a turmoil that begins with his wife's untimely death. He is forced to live the life of a fugitive away from his children. His only chance for redemption lies with a Japanese tycoon named Saitu, who wants him to do an inception (planting information into someone's mind). In order to accomplish this unprecedented task, Cobb and his team must overcome a labyrinth of unforeseeable challenges, where even a slight miss could trap them in a perpetual limbo. Any further revelation would be remissness on my part as the plot is filled with such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable of justifying its profundity. Leonardo Dicaprio gives a solid performance in the lead role, following his memorable performance in Shutter Island. He has brilliantly depicted the complexities and limitations of Cobb's enigmatic character highlighting his pain and mental trauma. Marion Cotillard is ravishingly scintillating as Cobb's whimsical wife, Mal. The rest of the cast has given a thorough performance with special mention of Ken Watanabe, Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.Inception is incredibly brilliant as a movie and is a breakthrough in contemporary cinema. Nolan's creativity and his unparalleled execution definitely make it an object of great cachet, but whether it would become Buñuel's 'Un chien andalou' or Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' and serve as a prototype for the movies to come is for the time to decide. Irrespectively, Inception is sine qua non not only for an aficionado, but also for the average viewer, who is willing to delve deep enough to savour the delight.PS: One has to imagine it to believe it. 9/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
23378,False,"Inception has a problem that I cannot bear: the constant that someone comes to explain the laws and how that world works. The creation of the character of Ellen Page (Ariadne) was for the sole purpose of explaining that to moviegoers. Not that it's bad, but at certain moments it seems like the movie becomes more class at school, to know how that universe works, instead of the characters in this movie live the adventure for themselves. In this aspect the film is didactic. And the space for the imagination is limited. In this aspect everything in this film is chewed, everything explained, where are the possibilities? I do not want someone to explain the universe, I want to see the characters live and react in this universe.Yes the ending leaves open the question whether that is a dream or reality, but it is a cheap gimmick instead of letting them our imaginations fly. If at the end of the movie the experience of the characters was a dream, so it was waste of two and a half hour, at least the Matrix shows the characters in the real world, and that it was not a dream inside a dream. The tension and time invested would not be a waste of time Not that it spoils the experience of the film, but it disturbs in some parts, mainly in the middle of the film, when the group is preparing for the assault. The concept is good, but it should be presented in a simpler way. Clearly Nolan was very ambitious in the concept of this film. But Nolan is quite integral in the proposal of his films, and he tries to put unknown concepts to the general public in such a cohesive way, even with the problem of trying to explain everything and other problems of pace are easily forgiven. Nolan tries to do his best in each of his films as if his movie was his last, as if his life depends on it. A great honesty on the part of Nolan, and this I can and I want to enjoy. Nolan is such an honest guy and scores points with me. It's the difference between the lousy movie director and an excellent director. The bad elements of Inception are not enough to spoil its qualities. The ambitious ideas of the filmmaker and the great sequences in parallel assembly that characterize his works. Not that the idea of Inception is innovative, this idea has been copied many times in other works (Paprika, Synecdoche New York and The Matrix are the most practical and common examples). But it's the way Nolan puts these ideas in the big budget blockbuster. Let's be honest here. Smaller or lower budget films are not seen by the general public due to the absence of of large production values (a great soundtrack, great locations for filming or great special effects, etc). See these ideas or concepts in a great Hollywood blockbuster made with such quality and care, it is amazing. And these ideas are embedded in the drama of the film in such a cohesive and exemplary way; it is applauding Nolan's professional integrity. This is why Nolan movies are so well received, he tries to put in these Hollywood blockbusters something more, something common in indie or smaller films, but with the financial aspect of the great studios to provide a better technical quality.Obviously there is quality on this movie; the large parallel sequences are exemplary. The parallel between the Van sequences, the hotel with the Joseph Gordon-Levitt (when character is awake in the elevator), the peak at the military base in the snow and the desolate city of Cobb and Mal is almost perfectly made with an all- encompassing soundtrack. Of course the sequences of action are lousy . And many dialogues are very weak. Two weaknesses in Nolan's movies.Bad things come with the good things. I suspect that the bad action scenes of Inception and Dark Knight were the reason why Nolan turned DKR into an action movie instead of trying to tell a good story, Nolan's ego should have been hurt by the criticism as he directs his action scenes in these two films. Particularly Inception and the action sequence in the snow with Tom Hardy. Too bad, sorry.But the performances are amazing, particularly Marion Cotillard as Mal. There are many layers in the various characters which Nolan conducts with mastery and the way they are inserted into the film is almost perfectly. Particularly in the initial sequence (which I thought would be a scene to showcase special effects, and Nolan proved me wrong). Or in the scene between Ariadne and Cobb, when Cobb tries to explain how his wife dies, and then discovered new layers of the character to reveal that in fact, he did have to do with the death of his wife. Of course this will be important to the outcome of the film. It is this ability to put the scenes and the flashbacks in certain key moments of the plot that Nolan shows much quality, and one of his long lists of virtues. Inception is a movie like any movie; it has its flaws, but also its virtues. But, for me the qualities overlap the defects, and in the end the movie is well worth watching. But is its legendary statute being worthy? If Inception was released in the 1980's would it have the same impact in that decade, as it had in 2010? Currently the commercial movies in Hollywood are in crisis. We live in an era of remakes, superhero movies and franchise fatigue without the studios or directors making an effort to improve with originality or at least with a little more original concepts. Inception's credit could be lower if today's Hollywood was not in such a decadent state. But nonetheless, Inception is still a good movie."
23379,False,"Inception is one of those movies that ""engaged"" film-goers will mistake for genius. Let me explain my theory on people and movies. There are three types of movie-watchers: passive, engaged, and intelligently engaged. Passive people will watch Die Another Day and like it just as much as the Bourne Identity. They don't go to the movies to think, they go to be entertained by cool effects and witty one-liners. Engaged people think they know what they're talking about, and generally love movies that are edgy in plot and execution but conventional enough to understand, like Fight Club and the subject of this review. They believe themselves to be refined in cinema, but, in reality, just don't quite have the intellect, cinematically speaking, to pull it off. Intelligently engaged people will appreciate the complexity of Inception, but also recognize it's a little sloppy, self-serious, over drawn, and empty. They recognize its audacity, but don't pretend like it is Kubrick or Paul Thomas Anderson. Suffice it to say, most people who fall into the engaged category will try and pretend that Inception is a 'masterpiece' and that they know everything about movies. They don't. Inception is clever, but it doesn't rank anything above respectable.The premise is ingenious, and Inception is able to live off its sheer mind-bendiness for the first 45 minutes. Leo is a specialist at entering people's minds through their dreams and extracting, or in this case, planting information. The dream world Nolan creates is so exciting and unpredictable that the audience, me included, couldn't care less about the actual story line. Unfortunately, when the magic wears off and the extravagantly overlong climax starts (almost at the midway point), things fall apart.The first problem is the eventual goal of the whole operation is seriously anti-climactic. As far as I could tell, they're trying to break up some obscure monopolistic multi-national company for a rich CEO, who in turn will give them large sums of money and Leo a way back to his kids. Sound under-developed? It is. Nolan never really fleshes it out. He is too busy creating spectacularly slick effects to get caught up in silly things like crucial plot points.When Inception hits its final profligate culmination (the climax inside the climax), I couldn't help but notice how empty it all was. Nolan makes the mistake of thinking multiple things happening at once equals suspense. In an effort to ratchet up the intensity, Nolan piles on at least 5 simultaneous plot-lines that climax at the same time. All this serves to do is suffocate the little suspense that had been built up. There is literally a fifteen minute stretch where Hans Zimmer's deafening score blares and Nolan annoyingly flips through the parallel actions like an ADD-afflicted friend who can't decide what channel to watch. It's mind- numbing, not to mention confusing as hell. One of these little subplots is particularly ridiculous and consists of a guy running around a snowbound bunker shooting people for the whole 15 minutes. Cutting-edge techno thriller? At this point, I was thinking more along the lines of a Roger Moore Bond flick.For all its structural faults, the single most damning aspect of Inception is its complete lack of heart or emotion. The one remotely human thread in the film deals with Leo and his mysterious dead wife. This thread is drawn out to excess and becomes more and more incomprehensible as the movie progresses. Inception seems to delight in keeping the audience in the dark regarding if Leo's wife is real or just a projection of his subconscious. Inception thinks it's awfully clever, but it's hard to feel emotion towards characters that you're not even sure exist. Near the end, I found the dialog between the unhappy couple completely devoid of meaning, made worse by Nolan attempting to give it resonance through close ups of people crying and a climaxing score. Despite the fact that the majority of this review deals with Inception's shortcomings, I actually like the movie as a whole. For all of its faults, I was grudgingly won over through Inception's pure style and visceral power. Nolan occasionally strikes brilliance, especially in an early scene where a dream explodes around Ellen and Leo in slow-motion virtuosity. This movie is not the genius many will claim, but it's not so bad either. Give it a shot, just don't expect to dream about it afterwards."
23380,False,"You have this basic idea and the story, they are very good. And boy did the have money. And the CGI is spectacular, yes.Further on this:Inception is constantly VERBALLY explaining what is happening, why it is happening, how it's relating to things explained earlier and so on. The rules, the plot, the inner conflicts. Even at the 2/3rd of the movie, they are still explaining basic rules. I don't see why this was necessary as most of it is repetition. You get the same stuff over and over again, supposed you didn't get it for the first time. And again: VERBALLY. Exactly like in your average, random Venezuelan soap opera.Inception does almost not have any scenes. As far as I'm concerned, movies are about scenes. Here, you'll only be able to remember certain sequences, because it's all just one big a montage of sequences. It's the montage of the master-plan from Oceans 11 for 150 minutes and it's exaggerating.The score is non-stop blaring, all the darn time, even when people are just talking to each other, music is building up constantly to give you the perception, that there are serious things going on. It's just annoying, painful for the ears and pointless. Generally important scenes are in no contrast to basic scenes. It's one big video clip.Characters. I don't remember a single name, as there is no kind of character development going on here. It's just some well dressed people. All the dialog is used up, for basic explaining like ""for dummies"", rather then building character, relationships, or just being generally cool dialog. Occasional tries sounds like tag-lines or slogans while being just plain unintelligent. Also, this is leaving the actors no space to - well - act... which is a waste of the great cast.Now all these things are very amateur scriptwriting mistakes, or if you prefer: it's a stupid movie. But no one seems to notice as Nolan does everything to convince you that you are watching something meaningful.The blaring music and the hectic editing, the fact that there are permanently 3 scenes of action cut together into one sequence underlined by an incredibly severe score, it's just there to distract. Because in fact the movie has nothing new to show us. Separate the sequences and you have the most basic and outdated action b-movie there is. Car chase. Fire fight. Explosion. Present it confusing enough so it seems complex. Same goes for the plot. The rules of the dream world are not complicated at all, you are absolutely able to sum it up in two sentences, just try. The Matrix set up it's world with a 10 minute sequence and we all got it where the whole theme is about equally, or more complex. Now Nolan is either deliberately confusing people for effect or simply because he doesn't have the skills as a scriptwriter to set up a movie. Neither of the versions seems too noble, but I guess it's a combination of those.Now the fact, that no one really seems to have noticed ALL THIS this is just a total riddle to me. Even famous film critics praise this movie as ground breaking and brilliant and I just can't see, where I am totally stupid, or why I'd construe all these mistakes into the movie, when in reality, they just weren't there.It's just malpractice, as what you have here is basic movie making rules ignored in the most inelegant fashion possible and then compensating for it with - well - money. Don't get me wrong, it's not knowing the rules and then breaking them, it just looks like not knowing the rules. It's what you could expect a first year student at a mediocre film school to do where his teacher then asks him to start all over again, with the first book. And it's just so ""in your face"". For most of the time, there is really nothing more then cutaways, the characters describing what is happening and Hans Zimmer smashing while you see expensive CGI and explosions.But everything just seems so damn serious and exclusive and the music is really dramatic. How could this movie not be good, right? But it's a trick. It's the concept of visceral over-stimulation brought to a new level and I'm shocked that it works to the point where after almost a century of film making THIS is regarded as one of the best movies of all time.IMDb TOT 250 #8. With The Godfather. Pulp Fiction. Schindler's List. The Shawshank Redemption. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. 12 Angry Men. Inception.4/10"
23381,False,"Contrary to the opinions of the deluded army of comic reading Nolan fanboy geeks who have descended on IMDb, Christopher Nolan has entirely and irrevocably disappeared up his own self inflated backside with this movie. I say The Emperors New Clothes because the director will sneer at anyone who doesn't understand the film and he has thus created a perfect defence mechanism. I'm sure Di Caprio et al had in depth briefings about the narrative and can explain it verbatim but us viewers are left to work it out for ourselves. And it's so full of holes, so full of irrelevant tripe and so full of itself that it isn't easy. It's incredible that its been voted the 3rd best film of all time by IMDb users. I mean seriously, that's a joke. The fanboys all want to laud Nolan as the new Kubrick (another joke) but in doing so they have voted this tosh above ALL of Kubricks work. It's such a smug self congratulatory film from the get go and it just gets smugger as time drags on.Now of course I appreciate that you can go too far in explaining every detail to the viewer with unnecessary script mechanics that insult the viewers intelligence. However, although you can go too far in explaining, you can also go too far in NOT explaining and expect the viewer to grasp in a single viewing what is a massively complex concept film - and one that's so badly flawed in so many areas for it to undermine the whole 'intellectual' nature of it. The idea of the film is OK and the film does have its moments but there are so many scenes that don't make sense that it spoils it entirely. I appreciate that 'heist' movies are usually procedural and that Nolan wanted to avoid that but in doing so he's created the most self-indulgent picture ever.I could go on about the snow scene, the thoroughly implausible way these people not only do what they do but 'assemble' as a team, the oh-I'm-Christoper-so-considerably-cleverer-than-you-are-Nolan backstory with Di Caprio's wife but I'm not going to pick apart the scenes because I'd be here for hours and I haven't got the energy left after enduring this nonsense. Besides; everything could be spun that he meant this or that (he isn't as deep as he likes you to think). Inception is all fur coat and no knickers. It explains so little of what is going on that I left feeling angry. And I generally get these films so it's not a case of me being some moronic fool who struggles to follow the weather. And billed as a completely original idea? Nah. There's obvious similarities with The Matrix, Dreamscape, Total Recall, Flatliners, Vanilla Sky, Pan's Labyrinth, Dream Demon and even one of the Star Trek Next Generation Episodes centred around the holodeck, all of which I've 'gotten' - the good ones, the bad ones, the ones you ponder for days afterwards. The fact is with this abomination I simply can't be bothered to think about it because I really don't care. I don't care about the characters, I don't care about the ending (which was excruciatingly predictable) and I don't care about how clever Nolan thinks he is. You're not mate. You've pulled a massive con with this film by creating a movie where you can call people stupid if they don't get it / like it. You get to sneer and snigger at the stupid little people. You've taken your previous successes to the movie execs and they've foolishly allowed themselves to fund your rampant self indulgence. That's what irritates me the most about this utter piffle. I understood what was understandable about this film and there are of course films where the intention is to purposely let the viewer fill in the gaps with their own imagination (generally a nice touch) but that simply isn't the case here. The story script and indeed most of the awful acting (outside of Di Caprio, Juno girl and Cillian Murphy) neither holds it together nor papers over the cracks of a weak script that's trying to be oh so deep... and badly failing.This is over 120 minutes of my life that I will never ever get back and I simply couldn't wait for the film to end. I had lost all interest in any of the characters, their backstorys or indeed the 'mission' after an hour once I woke up to the fact that he was clearly unable to pull the film together into something coherent and genuinely contemplative. And judging by the rest of the audience and the people I was with, I wasn't the only person who left feeling bitterly cheated. I congratulate Nolan on creating hysteria, mass hypnosis and hype because he's clearly managed to brainwash a lot of the audience into making them think they've seen a clever film. That's the only inception.Go and see this insidious fluff for a visual experience perhaps (even then; visually it's pretty overrated). But don't be surprised if you feel a strange peer group pressure to tell whoever you go to see it with that you understood it all when you probably didn't (or if you did; that you actually care and did so in spite of a dumb script).Nolan is not nor ever will be Kubrick. Kubrick would have done this film justice - after he had rewritten the script, changed half the cast, removed 45 minutes of length and replaced it with sensible content that made the film engaging and cohesive. I fear the next set of people to be duped will be those who vote for this trite idiocy come the Oscars.BTW I wager that Nolan watched Guy Ritchies Revolver and liked it. Congratulations Christopher, you have just descended to his level of filmmaking.Meh."
23382,False,"I'm afraid I'm a bit confused. I saw ""Inception"" last night. I had high expectations based on miles of positive ink from reviewers and professional critics, all tripping over themselves to bestow demigod status upon Christopher Nolan. These expectations were dashed to bits within the first thirty minutes of the film, and turned to a kind of dread as I realized what folks these days will accept as ""depth"" in their entertainment. I wish I'd never seen those gushing reviews, I would've enjoyed the film much more. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Christopher Nolan's Batman reboots ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight."" For my money, those were without a doubt the second and third most effective superhero movies to date (sorry, Raimi wins.) The man certainly knows how to keep a story moving along, and he knows how to film action. In the case of The Dark Knight, Heath Ledger provided an emotional lynchpin non-pareil in his Joker portrait, and Nolan milked it for all it was worth. There was real pathos and genuine mortal horror built into the foundation of the film's impressive structure. Also, the fact that it was based on a comic book lowered the bar and allowed the audience to suspend just enough disbelief to allow most of the dorky plot elements to slip through and do their work. Now let's discuss obvious comparisons to an earlier effort in this veinthat is, an action movie dolled up to the nines as philosophical treatise. I'll admit that I was never a fan of The Matrix. I thought it was asinine in conception and brutish in execution, even as I admired some of the visual effects and spectacular stunt work. Comparing The Matrix's ridiculous endless ""stream-of-consciousness"" gibberish about free will with, say, Roy Batty's laconic final soliloquy in Blade Runner, is like comparing the Twilight series' moronic teen romantic angst with David Foster Wallace. Unfortunately, Inception had precisely the same effect on me, which is to say very little. Here we find the great and terrible Nolan exploring the tired territory already plundered in countless films of yore, including Hitchcock's Spellbound and 1980's genre pics such as Brain Storm, The Dead Zone, and Dreamscape. The basic premise reads like a dime store sci-fi novel's back cover: ""In the future, we can enter into each other's dreams! Feel the magic of dreams, within dreams, within dreams! Experience the thrill and wonder of miraculous ""Dream Time."" Oh Boy!"" Within twenty minutes of the film's somewhat intriguing intro, I knew not only how it would endI also pretty much knew how we were getting there. Nolan plays primarily to the back row, andno offense, Americabut we've been slightly dumbed down over the past few decades, and we're much easier as a whole to entertain than we used to be. Look back at a few films of the past with vast, labyrinthine plot structures like Hawk and Faulkner's ""The Big Sleep"", or practically anything by the Coen Brothers. What's defines their deep-impact gravitas, as opposed to the flat and diffuse emotional landscape of Inception? It's character development, pure and simple. In this case, Nolan didn't have a single character especially the one played with typically earnest gusto by Leo Dicapriowith a plausibly human fatal flaw, foible, or reason for doing uh, whatever it was he was doing. We're simply dropped into an alternate universe with rules seemingly invented to favor nerds of any stripe almost impossibly similar to the one in The Matrixand told to hold onto our hats, because here we go! Except we're not actually GOING anywhere, or at least not anywhere we haven't been a thousand times before. Sorry to rain on the parade of everyone that's ready to lionize C. Nolan as the great white hope of modern blockbuster cinema, but from my vantage, there is no there there. If you want a lesson in basic existential philosophy, take a class at your local community college. You'll get more out of it, and you can keep your textbook as a souvenir. If it's great car chases you're after, rent ""The French Connection,"" or ""Ronin."" In other words, keep your high-octane action movie out of my high-concept art film. These are two tastes that do not go great together. Meanwhile, if Inception somehow does ""become a religion"" in another five years, than I'm reconsidering my continued faith in Hollywood as some kind of egalitarian oracle, where the huddled masses can go to get their myths, and feel the true power of redemption. If this is the kind of movie that will be worshipped from now on, than the god of blockbuster cinema may truly be dead."
23383,False,"My high expectations of this movie based on its no. 3 position in the Top 250 lasted for about 2 seconds into the movie. What a disgrace! And so childish. And Tiring! How can it be that everyone likes this movie. It's absolutely overloaded with bizarre and completely arbitrary turns of plot that have to be explained for about 75% of the movie. No character! No excitement, I could not even tell who were the bad guys. And yet again a few seconds of Michael Caine to camouflage the complete cardboard appearance of the entire cast! What is the meaning of this movie? What is it about? Uhhh???? Its internal logic is utter bullshit. Its emotional significance is zero, empty, frightening.Can please somebody agree with me, I feel so sad.Kurosawa come alive!"
23384,False,"This is a concept film, with a great deal of cgi. I love concept films, and feel cgi can make a movie much more powerful. However, this was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.First, there is zero character development. The lead role is a waste of DiCaprio's sizable talent.Second, the concept is not actually that interesting. There are many, many movies with much lower budgets that actually present the concept in a much more powerful and important way - such as _Scanners_.Third, the cgi is pathetically overdone. The cinematographers seem to expect the viewer to be overwhelmed by sheer scale, rather than use cgi to enhance a well-shot, well-scripted, well-conceived film. For an example of cgi used well, see _Pan's Labyrinth_ or _Attack the Block._ Most people will respond to sheer scale, but for viewers who love great films, this movie is bound to disappoint.I walked out of the movie and thought, ""so what?"" Then I thought, ""I just wasted $8.50, that's what."""
23385,False,"While it seems ingenious to invent a cunning conceit such as the one deployed in this film it is like a novel that uses neologisms and errant grammar and punctuation: it's effects tire and it seems less than it wishes it to be.The dramaturgy and logic of Inception is very simple and relies on a 'reductio' argument which is quite clear within 10 minutes,(and is absurd because of the logical impossibility of the argument itself like Wittgenstein's proof against skepticism) but it's true failing is not that: it is in fact the use of change and sudden effects as plot devices because once employed they heighten awe but kill any suspense or connection with the characters in the film. There is no reason or emotion in caring about characters that are chaff in a rather ordinary logician's game.Years ago Thomas Pynchon was considered an important writer, and the author and critic (and sometime film critic) Peter Ackroyd wrote an astute review of his major work, ""Gravity's Rainbow"", in which he ridiculed the ease of such writing; it's deceptive cleverness; it's egoism, and its immaturity because it is so overtly obvious, and like anything childish, of no real lasting interest artistically. Inception is that too. Instantly forgettable."
23386,False,"I cannot phrase it better, so I will quote Rex Reed who called Inception's storyline ""prattling drivel."" A friend claimed Inception is a ""thinking person's movie"", but a thinking person will realize that it is only masquerading as a thinking person's movie. At bottom, intellectually, ""there is no there there."" Add to this that someone clearly believed the film needed to be pumped up with overwrought drama to qualify it as a ""summer blockbuster."" I couldn't wait for it to end, and when it did, the intrusiveness of the loud, schlocky music over the closing credits seemed to crystallize all the incipient negative feelings I had been having throughout the movie. I hope that this director will go back to doing smaller films that do not stretch his concepts beyond what they can support."
23387,False,"This movie is a disaster on many levels, but where it fails most miserably is at attempting to put dreams on screen. This movie is the most un-dreamy movie ever made, and as critics have said since the beginning of moving pictures, watching a movie is like dreaming with your eyes open. Colin McGinn covers this in great depth in his book ""The Power of Movies"", in which he discusses the spatio-temporal discontinuity in films: the camera can record a given scene and then leap to another place and time entirely. This is what movies do! Nolan treats this heavy-handed hopping about as if he's discovered something. What he's lost is the mysterious, moody, enigmatic quality of dreams, the tremendous emotional wallop. ""Inception"" is so detailed, so measured, with constant explication, that nothing is left to the imagination. How ironic is that? And to fill a movie about dreams with carefully designed car chases, gun battles, and mayhem of all kind...it's anti-dreaming. I've never watched a film so awake, so aware of itself, so full of itself. A hundred years from now when cultural historians look at this era of Runaway Bigism - Big Government, Big Corporations, Big Bodies! - they can use over-blown and spiritually empty films like this (and ""Dark Knight"") as good examples of what ruined the country. Wretched excess."
23388,False,"I shook my head in disbelief and disappointment while groaning thru the last 30 minutes .should have walked out on it70% of the movie is spent with the characters trying to explain, and then re-explain the ""overly far-fetched"" parameters and boundaries of the plot TO EACH OTHER! - I am pretty sure the actors couldn't keep pace with what was happening. I bet there are equally like-minded scripts circulating at this very moment thru mental hospitals across the country.The makers of this film expect you to buy into an awful lot (and that's just within the first 3 minutes) - leading you around and around not knowing if you can even believe anything that happened only moments before and then, you get the nice overly used ""OR IS IT??????"" totally smarmy and puzzling ending!!! (I saw that turd coming a mile away too)I guarantee you this an evening rental of the movie and you will not be able to stay awake far too many changes in direction, each one more annoying than the previous and yet still somewhat predictable.I'll sum it up like this and see if you are still interested..""It's a dream within a dream, within a dream, within a dream (that's right 4 annoying levels sleep) and possibly. Within yet another dream when it finally ends. COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL.N O T ! ! ! ! ! ! !I say, ""If you must go bring something to throw at the screen NO STARS.EVER. This film solidly establishes the new ""basement"" in film making """
23389,False,"We went to see this movie at an IMAX theater. After reading the initial reviews about the special effects and the cinematography, and seeing all of the trailers and special shorts on the film, this seemed like a sound choice. What an absolute waste of money! After reading the other user reviews, I can't help but wonder if we didn't watch a completely different film. All science fiction films require a suspense of reality as they are based on a future time, feature incredible technology which is currently beyond our reach, etc. Given that, most films try to put this aspect into some kind of context which makes the central premise believable or possible. Not in this case. This film's plot vehicle is something called is 'shared dreaming,' through which a third-party can access your dreams and unlock information you are keeping secret. It is somehow done by connecting the dreamers up to a devices contained in stylish briefcases and then - POW - they are in an apparent instant REM state, all connected together and journeying off in their dream world. Huh? It's just thrown out there and the audience is expected to just absorb the concept, accept it and move on to be wowed by all the special effects. A murmur of 'I don't get it' was heard throughout the theater I was in.Early in the film Dicaprio approaches a student played by Ellen Page, who is a student of his old professor and asks her to be an 'architect' and design his dream environments for him. The environments must have mazes and paradoxes. Now, most folks when presented with such a concept would be calling the nut house on a guy like Dicaprio, but Page's character just accepts the whole thing and dives in, having a whee of a time with the environment she creates, bending it and reforming it in visually impressive ways. There is no attempt, however, to sell this whole thing to the audience and it just doesn't work in any sort of context. As the team descends through layers of 'levels' of dreams, the whole thing just becomes more moronic and boring. Great visuals, lots of action, but it all just seems pointless.I would put this down as one of the worst movies I've ever seem. Beautifully shot, but with an empty, stupid plot."
23390,False,"Everyone knows no matter how absurd it is, a dream is as real as (sometimes more so than) reality. Instead of taking advantage of this (lack of creativity? too scared?), the film confines itself to mirroring reality in every way - be it time, space, surroundings, physicality, ideas, or behaviours. Under the incoherent, made-up-as-we-go logic, the film is but a low-grade action film in a sci-fi disguise. The story line is laughably childish, the music is over dramatic and there's zero character development. It's a shame to see Ellen Page and Michael Caine's talent abused in this dribble. It's such a pity, really. In the right hand the same material could flourish and treat us to mind-blowing wonders and imaginations. Christopher Nolan has missed the point completely: dreams can be absolutely anything. Anything! We want to see rules bent and physics defied. But instead we were given the action sequence and plot from a 70s B movie. Entertainment-wise it's not that bad a film (admittedly there are far worse action films around), probably 2.5 stars if you leave your brain outside the theatre. But given the current unjustified high rating, I have to give it a super low one to tip the balance."
23391,False,"The title pretty much sums the movie up. An absolutely amazing cast and incredible premise was almost wholly pushed to the margin by special effects and ""action"". My hopes were too high. Nolan was clearly out of his depth as far as intellect goes and totally blew the chance to pull off an epic, unprecedented dream heist flick.Dear Nolan, if you're reading this: You can give guns, grenade launchers and C4 to a cast of unknown actors, place them virtually anywhere and have them destroy everything in sight for two hours, and it would have been just as good as this movie.Thanks for ripping me off by luring me in with an allure that promised slick corporate spies engaged in mind games in surreal settings and instead taking it from a promising half-way point into a senseless visceral joyride that was quite literally the cinematic equivalent of van Gogh painting Starry Night then taking a bowie to it and slashing it to ribbons before the paint has a chance to dry.It's painfully clear that you wrote the script to allow you to stroke your ego with the most over-the-top action flick you could cook up. With the money you spent on all the great actors you employed for this, you could have hired a dozen great writers to develop a script that would have actually been worthy of their talent. You sir, simply WASTED it. I actually feel embarrassed for Michael Caine. That such a fine actor was dragged into this crap is sad. You could have just flashed a still photograph of his face for a few frames and it would have sufficed since you don't pause for even a second to develop ANY of the characters except for Cobb and anyone with half a brain was probably wondering WHY character development was so scant in a film that deals so heavily with the subconscious mind. No, I guess a car chase was more important. It's entirely beyond me why you tainted your ego-stroking action flick with a genuinely thought-provoking premise when all the ""smart parts"" flew over the heads of your target audience by a wide berth.tl;dr version: shallow, pseudointellectualist excuse for making an obscene, self-gratifying action flick. I hope to god you get your money's worth if you actually pay to see this garbage."
23392,False,"I could explain the devices that drive the action, but that would take away the jobs of all the archetypes in the film who's job it is to endlessly spout exposition that will explain the nonsensical and unaffecting action you see on the screen.If you think one level of action clichés is enough to rot your brain to a sub-100 IQ level, imagine SEVERAL levels of action clichés, all explained for you in a ""hey this isn't very interesting but we've created a world and have to explain it so we can get back to the gunfights in a dreamworld"".I'd probably put this down as one of the most empty viewing experiences I've ever had in my 40 years of movie-going. I want my money and 120 minutes (I left early) back."
23393,False,"It is unbelievable that this film has received such accolades by reviewers. It is as if the film itself is trying to practise in real life its own concept: planting in the viewer's mind from the inception that it has extraordinary merit. This must be the ultimate film business gambit and possibly the most daring ever tried in film promotion history. Surrounded by mind-numbing images and eleven-dimensional sound you are told a hundred times every minute what a great film you are viewing. Just look at the audience when you go to see it (as I am sure you will): they looked bored and perplexed but have arranged their faces in expressions of seeming appreciation in fear of being thought of as square, to use and old beatnik term. This would be the dullest film I have ever seen, almost anyway, and everyone I spoke to - even strangers - after the showing said that from its INCEPTION they could hardly wait for it to finish. Money has scaled new heights of desperation to be made. Shame on all the actors who contributed to this disgraceful exercise in megalomaniacal money-making!"
23394,False,"Apart from being a boring and absolutely stupid movie, there are some other points that bother me. 1) Both this movie and TDK got up to the top 5 of IMDb without any evident reason, which makes me suspect there is a ring of ""paid"" contributors bringing the movie up. Once it is off the cinema, it will start dropping, as ""real"" people give the votes and not the dream-reviewers. 2) I actually believe in the perspective of the dead wife; the whole reality is ultimately a dream and a creation of our own consciousness. What bothers me is how my subconsciousness could create such a crappy and meaningless movie."
23395,False,"No, seriously. It's not as good as people say. It did win four Oscars, but those were all in areas where the film truly does excel: visuals and sound.As for the plot, it's as full of holes as a Swiss cheese and about as smelly. A great cast can do little to make up for that.Don't believe me?http://bit.ly/1mk1xvyhttp://bit.ly/1p5u23wI really can't add much to that.The plot holes and the major inconsistencies, paired with the philosophical depth of a 14-year- old (is really ANYTHING real???) means there's little going for this film beyond the amazing visual effects and sound. Now, that would go a long way, if not for the fact that it's so ridiculously loooong! What we have here is a sensory tour de force dragged down by an atrociously poor story played out by amazing actors trying desperately to bring life to ridiculously shallow and one-dimensional characters.I've tried. I've seen it twice by now. That's five hours of my life I'm not getting back."
23396,False,"Siigh...okay, it took me a whole week to decide to put my thoughts about this disappointing crapfest down in writing, so here goes...I do not agree with those reviews that state this is an ""original"" idea of Nolan's. Haven't you people seen the anime film, ""Paprika?"" And what about ""The Matrix""? Those movies, to me, did a MUCH BETTER job in dealing with the concept of dreams and the distortion between them as far as what exactly ARE dreams and what exactly IS reality? IMHO, ""INCEPTION"" was a mess. To me, and to a lot of other people, it was ambiguous just for the sake of being ambiguous.Just one of my many beefs about this movie was that dreams should be amorphic. People's faces, backgrounds, should've been somewhat distorted or at least a little blurry. Things should not have been so artfully contrived. Most if not ALL dreams, are not so well crafted or constructed down to the last detail. All we got with ""INCEPTION"" was falling buildings??! Really? There was NOTHING dream-like about ANY of those scenes. Even when Ellen Page ""oh-so-perfectly"" designed, maneuvered and constructed bridges and mirrors and other crap. Gimme a break! Everything was just WAAAYY too convenient and perfectly timed down to the minute. And what the hell is ""LIMBO""??? What, we're all just supposed to accept this kind of blatantly crappy inexplicable science-fiction?And even though some things don't always HAVE to be explained, the mystery surrounding the dream ""device"" and that dream ""drug"" wasn't all that interesting. I was able to suspend my disbelief in movies like ""Paprika"" and ""The Matrix"" because not only were those story lines just way more cohesive(as far as story arcs are concerned), I was also given enough exposition to actually CARE about some of the characters. I didn't get to that point with ""INCEPTION"". Even though I really liked Tom Hardy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's characters, I didn't really give a crap if they got sent towait for it.the limbo of no return. God. It actually made me wince to type that.Like many reviews so aptly and succinctly stated, this movie simply hobbled along due to a seriously weak exposition and atrocious plot pacing. It was VERY self-indulgent. And the ending was not only predictable, it insulted my intelligence. Nolan is one of the most overrated directors out there, and this movie is just another vehicle for his enormous ego to perpetuate the notion that he's a genius when he's really a hack. He may have some really good ideas and concepts, but he SUCKS on his follow through. He knows how to generate the hype machine, which makes people feel like, if they didn't ""get"" or ""like"" one of his movies, then they're not part of the really ""cool"" and ""in"" sub-culture of our times. Just like with TDK, which I think was and still is THE most overrated movie of our time.Don't buy into the hype. Stop letting ol' Nolan boy pull the strings. If one of his movies sucks, then it sucks. There's nothing at all wrong, uncool or apocryphal about that. It just IS. And this DID.And come on, people! This movie in NO WAY deserves a rating above a 9 or an 8! Try about a 6.5. No higher."
23397,False,"Well, it's of course not 1 out of 10, more like 4, but in the light of current rating 9 out of 10 and climbing I'd give it a negative number. Please, please, please ignore its IMDb rating - it's becoming more and more meaningless. The idea for the plot is actually pretty interesting and some scenes are original but that's pretty much it. Each and every character is one-dimensional and shallow, the political setting is such a cliché and ending is easily predictable. There is a lot of stupid and unneeded chasing and shooting, punching and kicking, very much like in cheap Chinese movies. Which is fine in itself if all that you expect is an action movie, but if you expect something more memorable, then just skip it in theatres and rent a DVD in a few months. While watching such movies there is feeling that it's made like a puzzle from predefined pieces. Each piece was seen million of times before and the whole does not add anything on its own. I wholeheartedly agree that shooting a movie is not easy, and nobody can probably generate enough fresh ideas to produce a masterpiece each time. This time Nolan produced a mediocre result, let's wish him next time to make less primitive and more interesting show."
23398,False,"I am rating this film 1/10 to try to lower the kind of insane 8.8 rating.I picked up this movie expecting something that would bend my mind. A good sci-fi story open to interpretation and contemplation on the fabric of dreams and reality and how you are to distinguish one from the other. A sense of wonder. I'm gonna keep this short and say that Inception did not give me that sense of wonder. Inception is an average Hollywood action sci-fi with nicely rendered CGI and famous actors who neither amaze nor disappoint. If this is what you are looking for in a movie, inception might be right up your alley. If not, I can suggest a couple of good films that are specifically about dreams. Go watch ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and the anime ""Paprika"".My definitive score for inception is a 5/10. It's just average in every aspect, and will probably not leave any sort of mark on film history for being either particularly good or bad, from an objective point of view. From a more personal point of view though, I thought this movie sucked big time.Have a nice day!"
23399,False,"I don't know what I was watching and I didn't care. This Matrix rip-off is very implausible and the science behind it will never be invented. In the old times this plot would be made into a B-movie. Nowadays big money is allocated because we all want to see some impossible thing that is cool to look at.In my dreams I run fast but don't go anywhere; or I shoot a guy 20 times and he laughs in my face. My cousin repeatedly appears in my dreams and if I ever find him sleeping in the next room inserting himself in my dreams I'll kick his ass.2/10 for the Germans for their sharp Carl Zeiss lenses. I better go have a real dream, that's 8 hours of my life that feels like 5 minutes. Good night folks and please rate my dream 9/10, for its* more real.*I deliberately typed ""its"" instead of ""it's,"" because this is the vogue on the net."
23400,False,"I am astonished by the reviews posted. My only explanation is that this deadly dull movie put everyone else to sleep and they thought they saw a better movie. The performances were very lackluster and the actors all (except for Tom Hardy) looked like they were performing in their sleep.There was no reason for any of the characters to be involved in this plan from a personal motivation reason, and their behaviours were completely arbitrary. Did they get paid for their time or was there some other reason to what they were doing in this scheme with the main character? I felt no connection or empathy for the main character or his motivation. There was no sense of unreality or mystery one would expect in a dream. The action sequences were dull and seemed to be just shooting people because there was a perceived need to have some gun fire. I struggled to stay in the theatre and see it through let alone stay awake."
23401,False,"Boring. Overlong. Stupefying. Cheap.It's easy to fool a sheep. Take an idea with great potential and then throw it in a barrel and burn it. Then throw a banal senseless story that barely looks complex, mix it with cheap action and waste over 2 hours of everyones lives. And the sheep rejoice because they think it is intelligent, daring, original and emotional. The truth is sad; it's just another generic Hollywood blockbuster action set in a ,,fantastic'' setting. It insults intelligence and anyone with an IQ > 70 gets it, and the majority praises it for it's emptiness because only that can they understand. These types of movies make me wonder if we really deserved a comet in 2012."
23402,False,"Brilliant technical wizardry. Heady, at least apparently so. A ride more than a movie but a movie none the less. Chris Nolan is rapidly becoming the director of his generation and I'm longing to find out what is he trying to say. He has established his technical power again and again but if I think of ""Memento"" for instance I remember the gimmick but not what the story was really about. I suspect the same will be said of ""Inception"". I'm not putting down, I'm just wondering. I left the theater full of questions and nobody could actually give me any answers. I'm not talking about the plot but at the way Christopher Nolan chose to tell the story. Leonardo Di Caprio is acquiring some extra gravitas as an adult presence on the screen.Loved Cillian Murphy, I always do. Riveted by Tom Hardy. Enchanted by Marion Cotillard. Amused by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and delighted by Ellen Page. I wonder what Mr Nolan will do for an encore."
23403,False,"The reviews that call this ""genius"" are just ridiculous. The plot was so overwhelmingly incredulous that even the most open minded movie goer would find this plain brain dead.I love the long mundane reviews of this ""work of art""/""masterpiece"". How much were you fools paid to write such garbage.Half through my son summed it up best when he asked ""dad, is it almost done yet?"" Enough said.3 thumbs down from our group and 8 thumbs down from co-workers.Odd, my own little cross section severely diverges from the reviews in IMDb......hmmmm.."
23404,False,"This is ,unfortunately, a cinematic catastrophe, and all my expectations that I might have had before like this being the most original film of the year that might open a new page in the sci-fi genre, proved completely and utterly misconceived, to say the least. This is simply the most overrated film after Nolan's Dark Knight, supposedly intended to represent a pinnacle of intellectualism, originality, and ideas never before even hinted at. But, all in all, this is nothing but two and a half hours of utter and sheer nonsense, a real viewing terror, a debasement of a genre! It is in the limitless realm of quasi-Freudian, or is it Yungian ?, philosophy, e.g., a dream fixing, and the main actors are faced with a difficult task of deciphering the way to create the dream within the dream within the dream, and when you expect to see some true scary Freudian elements or dream symbolisms of destruction and, God Forbid, sex, no, you are left in the cold with your feet dangling in the aforementioned 'within loops', as sexuality, as we all know, is the source of all the modern evils, and as this film is intended for all and sundry, e.g. like a pleasant, 'wellness ' relaxation after a really exhausting 3-hour shopping spree, the family must let some steam off in the nearby cinema, and ,voila, Inception is here with a correctly calibrated dose of illogical shooting and explosions ( at least I got to see the technology and weapons the Alpine units today use ), and ,yes, not only DiCaprio survives , everybody else fares the same, so have no fear, Nolan is here! But, the damn time, it just won't follow the film's logic, 140 minutes is a heck of a time to kill the boiling fury over this total waste of money, time and personal dignity. Thank God for Star Wars, Star Trek, Alien series and a million other films. Crisis in the screenplay department has really surpassed the worst personal expectations, now even the illiterate are writing  Just horrible "
23405,False,"People must have gone insane!!! I usually don't give my opinion in blogs, forums etc. because it makes me feel like a dog barking in the dark at unknown strangers. And I don't like this registration forms and surveys and other marketing bullshit tools that sites like this are using. But... this film and its absurd rating provoked me so much that I had to brake my principles. I have seen A LOT of movies. Thousands of movies. And I(please forgive my lack of modesty)consider my self an intelligent person. At least a little bit over the average level. And I am mad at this movie and at the 99% of all these people that with their votes made me believe that this movie deserves 148 minutes of my life. No it doesn't deserve even these 50 which I generously gave it... Despite of all its ""layers"", special effects, computer graphics and multimillion dollar budget, this movie is simply a flat, pointless, boring and not even entertaining bullshit. It insults me, because it's made for elementary school kids, uses their language, verbally explains every step like in the mute films of the twenties, and pretends to be a high class entertainment for smart people. Yesterday I watched 4 or 5 European and South American movies. None of them had budget higher than 15 million dollars. Inception doesn't worth even a tenth of the worst of them with its 160 million dollar budget. Apart from the special effects I don't see anything good in it. Acting is bad, dialogue is worse, and entertainment is zero. I was actually forcing myself watching and waiting to see the point of all this... Couldn't bear anymore when my watch showed that 50 minutes have passed. And I love Science Fiction movies. I even from time to time enjoy watching a B rate movies, which make you relax and give you 2 hours of entertainment away from everyday stress. This one just made me checking my watch every 2 minutes to see when it would finally end... Basta!!!Don't waste your time and money!"
23406,False,"Guys, don't waste your money. This is just a lousy remake of Tarkovsky ""Solaris"" with modern entourage made in Hollywood, camouflaged with some new lines without a philosophical background with some extra bang-bang for the young generation. It's impossible for a youth to understand serious movie and this action-decorated replica probably helps them to see the original masterpiece. Actually, actors' performances are not very strong either, only Marion Cotillard tried to set an equality with her Academy Award prize. FX are interesting, but probably it's the only strong point in the whole film. It's very sad, that Hollywood completely run out of good scripts and this is their last idea how to attract people to a cinema."
23407,False,"Where to begin? Well,the soundtrack is unnecessarily loud, noisy and repetitious and consequently extremely irritating!!!!!!!!! How many times can you crank the big violin sound up? hOW MANY EXCLAMATION POINTS DO YOU NEED? hIT ME OVER THE HEAD SOME MORE!!! pLEASE!!!! I felt it didn't sync with the film at all. God help those folks whose neighbors have surround sound and play this at even normal volume. After 30 minutes of this I'm ready to #*&%#$%%.With regard to the film itself, it's the same 15 minutes of plot over and over and over until you want to throw up! I ""got it"" after the first 30 minutes but apparently this director believes his audience is comprised of morons who enjoy spending 2 1/2 hours watching pointless gun battles and cars crashing. And it appears that his conclusion may be true based on the gushing praise for this over-hyped grade ""C"" movie. Little of this ""special effects"" activity advances the film in a significant way. How boorish! By far one of the worst acclaimed films I've ever seen. I'd rather go to the dentist than sit through this. My biggest regret is I can never regain the time I spent on this utterly silly piece of #$@&*^%*."
23408,False,"At the end of the movie I was really surprised that someone actually stole the whole plot from ""Paprika"", an anime released in 2006.Nolan shamelessly took story, characters and even scenes from Paprika - which goes way beyond ""inspiration"". Go search for Paprika on the net for yourself.For the dialogues and directing: The first hour was just awful. That old shoe Leonardo and some other soulless characters talking and talking and talking. I just wanted to stand up and shout: SHUT UP AND GIMME A REASON TO WATCH!And after noticing the whole idea was stolen, I really had a hard time not to leave. But I gave it a shot.Nothing changed, three scenes switching all the time: falling car, dude fighting in hotel, a group of Chuck Norrisses fighting in snow. And that for an hour. Whee whee special effects! OK, but special effects should be the cherry on the delicious ice cream, not the ice cream itself.Do yourself a favor and save your time and money. Unless you are into quickly changing scenes and super-mystical-pseudo-deepness with a bullshit ending (which are a lot of people)."
23409,False,"I don't get all the positive reviews for this movie. I found it overlong and I could not find a reason to care about any of the characters. Technically speaking, there was no true heroic character, as it was a bunch of technologically-advanced criminals and their victims. At several points during the movie I was pleading ""Go home! Go home!"" It had a decent idea but I have to think that Rod Serling (RIP) probably could have done a much better job with this and he would have done it in a shorter time. I really think the writers and producers could have made a tighter film with better and more interesting characters. Christopher Nolan did terrific, terrific work with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but this film is unworthy of its success."
23410,False,"I watched it with five friends last night and other then one girl, no one liked the movie. The potential is there but it was missed somehow... There were more bullets flying in this movie, then six season of the A-team combined! It didn't really matter what was going on, all of a sudden you had people shooting all over the place, then they would stop and then the would shoot again.. shooting, shooting and shooting.. Hey, if I wanted to see a war movie I would have rented Rambo instead!I don't understand what's the big fuss about this movie. The plot is weak, the ending is Meh and the movie is way too long. The idea is very nice but the writers tried to turn it into a big Action/Drama/Thriller and they failed three times!A few cool effects but that's about it.. two thumbs down!"
23411,False,"Why are people going mental over this Matrix/Paprika wannabe? It's undeservingly credited for way to many things. Maybe I'm being too harsh since it's the best blockbuster in the last two years, but lets be honest. The first half of the movie is drowning in clichés and the rule 'show, don't tell' is not being utilized at all. Am I the only one who finds those tedious dialogues when they explain the whole plot (as if we were ten year olds) - really annoying? The real people in those situations would talk and react completely differently. That makes the character interactions and conversations barely believable and just empty.Also, actors who play Saito and Mal are really destroying any credibility of the drama and tension movie has. Saito (besides being a Morpheus wannabe) always talks as if he was simply happy he remembered the lines. And why, oh why do they have such unnatural, bad and forced accents? Ellen Page was a bad choice too (another cliché - younger student learns everything sensei has to say in 2 min and then teaches HIM a lesson). DiCaprio wasted his talent here, his powerful acting was ruined by the forced tension of the movie and a lousy soundtrack (which apparently never stops).The second half of the movie was better and combined with the end gave a certain satisfaction in terms of mental food. Nolan really is a master of plot and king of moments - unfortunately this is obviously becoming his biggest weakness. The overall impression is: it could have been a LOT better. It's not awful, but giving it a 10 and calling it a benchmark is just ridiculous."
23412,False,"Nolan has made some of the dreariest films in recent memory, but this incomprehensible nonsense takes the cake. While keeping a straight face, actors deliver lines such as ""dreams within dreams is too unstable"" and ""if we get killed we'll be lost in limbo till our brains turn into scrambled egg."" DiCaprio and company supply the ham. This movie tells us that ten hours of real time is equivalent to one week of dream time. That explains why this nightmare of a movie feels like it goes on for two days despite the running time of two and a half hours. And if one falls asleep while watching, the only way to resume one's normal life is to limbo under a totem pole."
23413,False,"i cant believe this movie has this great rating!! it was down right ridiculous!! the idea of several people being in the same dream. this is what happens throughout the movie. its impossible, and its just not even made to be believable, even by the movie. nothing in this movie would ever happen in real life, nor would anyone want it to.the whole movie objective is spent trying to plant an idea in someones head(through a dream) in order to get him to destroy/sell off his company in real life. if you wanted to plant an idea in someones head to influence him to do something, why the hell would you use a dream to do it??? who ever acts on stuff that happens to them in their dreams?? i mean i dream every week i can fly like superman, but i don't wake up and go diving off buildings!! cause its just a dream, the events that happen in dreams didn't really happen!!! so why would i take real life action on them..man this movie was such a blunder, i cant believe so many people bought into it. there were a few cool visuals, but nothing spectacular. the plot is very poor and the movie is trying to tell too much in too little time, and it all ends up in a mess of a movie"
23414,False,"When i see any upcoming NOLAN films, i cannot hold my nerves together...Starting from the sheer brilliance of MEMENTO,THE PRESTIGE,THE DARK KNIGHT n all perhaps he is the most talented and thought innovative director in Hollywood..In other words, unless u see a NOLAN film till the climax , u cant't predict it's ending n that's what i like about him...He simply keeps puzzling the past and the present in perhaps the most thoughtful way... Coming 2 the film, its another gem of a work by Di Caprio after SHUTTER ISLAND...N wen u have casting like MICHAEL CAINE,ELLEN PAGE,Joseph GORDON- LEVITT etc its surely a must watch..I can assure u that u cant't even leave a single second while watching the film..It's a sci-fi,thriller directed by NOLAN..That says it all... Afterall ""YOUR MIND IS THE SCENE OF THE CRIME""... Frankly speaking a must watch movie without any doubt...."
23415,False,"I am fascinated by the range of opinions people have about this film and I am astonished that people have rated it highly. Some people have even suggested this is one of the top 5 films of all time. Bizarre.What Inception really reminded me of was the Emporer's New Clothes. If enough people say something is great a lot of others are likely to be swept along by the idea, frightened to go against popular opinion. Well I'm glad that a lot of people have been honest enough to say that this film is not half as good as the marketing department would have us believe.The latest I heard from the pluggers was the film has to be seen more than once to appreciate it. Ha! Good try guys but I can't imagine anyone being prepared to give this another try.The script made no sense and the characters were unbelievable. Worst of all, I felt no attachment for any of the characters and did not care what happened to them.In my opinion, this is a meaningless, uninspired waste of time. Unoriginal idea, weak script, insipid acting, plot and logic holes galore do not add up to a blockbuster. The film gets 4 marks for the impressive CGI but loses 2 of those for the derivative James Bond sequence.The lady to my left spent the last two hours sound asleep. I was very jealous of her."
23416,False,"I know its meant to be about dreams....is that why i found it so hard to stay awake to watch it? This is a typical American shoot'em up/blow'em up crapola with ugly characters woodenly reading out a script so bad it's embarrassing. Right from the start, an amateurish gun shot/smash-up everything you can find scene I realised this was going to be another Hollywood failed attempt at making a thriller. If only the guy who made the ads for it had also directed the movie, sighhh Perhaps they hoped to mix Medium with Bourne Identity, but failed so badly i kept dozing off. Think eyes wide shut, or mothman 2 for dragging script and plot, and imagine the team at sesame street being tasked to think up Matrixlike effects and you have it, utterly utterly disappointing."
23417,False,"I sat through the whole thing without the least idea of what was going on. It seemed like an endless string of herky-jerky, two second scenes with next to nothing to connect them. Lots of guns and explosions for those who like fireworks, but the plot was invisible. None of the characters provoked even the mildest of interest from me. Clearly, a lot of money was spent on special effects, but because something can be done doesn't mean it should be. While I am not a writer, I seem to remember that a story should have an arc. There was nothing like that here - only a bunch of random dots. Overall, a total mess. Don't waste your money. Minus 5 stars."
23418,False,"I had huge expectations for this film reading all its glowing reviews. And yet even before it started and the menu fired up, alarm bells were going off. Explosions left right and centre, great CGI.....all suggested a lack of substance. For the first 20 minutes, I couldn't believe just how bad this film was. Drop the viewer into a complete state of confusion to look good?.....except that this is always a risky strategy, one which a only few films have eloquently pulled off, the nearest comparable being The Matrix, which this most certainly isn't- although it tries so hard to be in terms of style and delivery. Yes the CGI and special effects are at times breathtaking. It's just such a shame that the storyline was utterly ridiculous, disjointed, confusing dispassionate and so very, very boring. Great effects DO NOT make for a great film necessarily. A note on casting. Like the film, this is truly awful....what on earth was Leonardo Di Caprio thinking?! My wife totally embraced the subject matter- she fell asleep and the only thing stopping me from dozing off was the desperate hope that that this film would improve. It didn't. Inception completely encapsulates all the worst in Hollywood. Utter rubbish."
23419,False,"Well, I didn't think it lived up to all the hype, but nonetheless it was still a pretty good film. I don't think the story came out quite the way Nolan had hoped, after working on it for over a decade. In my view the story is basically a combination of Vanilla Sky meets The Matrix, but really it ends up being less meaningful than both (A combination of the mystical waking dream and the matrix of consciousness). This is Nolan's version of Edgar Allan Poe's A Dream Within A Dream, or the like. However I don't think the film really comes across this way as well as it should, or especially, the way it was meant to.Take this kiss upon the brow! And, in parting from you now, Thus much let me avow- You are not wrong, who deem that my days have been a dream; Yet if hope has flown away in a night, or in a day, In a vision, or in none, Is it therefore the less gone? All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream.I stand amid the roar Of a surf-tormented shore, And I hold within my hand Grains of the golden sand- How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep- while I weep! O God! Can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp? O God! Can I not save One from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream? The film overall feels forced and clunky, it lacks any kind of good rhythm. For me to see this film ranked in the top 15 films ever made according to the IMDb voters only goes to prove one thing; The IMDb top 250 list is good for nothing at all but a laugh. I thought Inception was pretty good. However pretty good is stretching it as far as I would ever go. This film is a long long way from great.7/10"
23420,False,"A shame that this movie is rated so highly on IMDb. Let me tell you this, this movie is NOT a masterpiece and doesn't even deserved to be among the top 250 of the best movie of all time. A true masterpiece has to be flawless and this movie is worth at most 5.8, no more. The neuro-nonsense that follow suit from a scientific and a philosophical point of view, Inception doesn't make any sense at all...Inception must start with a self-consistent theory of how the human brain works. What is a memory? What is a dream? Because most of us human beings walk around with only very fuzzy answers to these questions, filmmakers are able to take rather outlandish positions on them without arousing any hackles.In the case of Inception, the unstated premise of dreaming is that one one is asleep, one is inhabiting what essentially amounts to a parallel reality external to the mental state of the dreamer. This premise makes for an admittedly entertaining film, but it is preposterous. Dreaming is an entirely subjective experience; everything is an illusion generated and perceived by the brain itself. You can no more ""enter"" someone else's dream than you can enter into a movie that's playing on the multiplex screen.If you ""wake up"" from a dream and realize that you're still dreaming, you haven't entered a different level of some dream-reality continuum -- you've just experienced another illusory sensation. Contrary to the premise of the film, there is no ""architecture"" of a dream. We may feel like we're inhabiting an elaborate, detailed and consistent landscape, but that's just part of the illusion. There are some ideas about dreaming in the film that are actually accurate. For instance, it's true that they are powerfully influenced by emotion and subconscious cognition. And we often do wake ourselves with a powerful muscle spasm, which sleep researchers call a ""hypnic jerk."" But the movie also trades in ideas that amount to little more than folklore. It toys with the old idea that if you die in your dream, you will also die in real life.In the movie, if you die in your dream, you will enter a kind of coma. For obvious reasons, there is no evidence for bangungut-like phenomena, or rather any evidence has gone with the dreamers to their graves.What about the idea that time slows down within a dream, that an elaborate sequence of events in dream-space can take place in a few seconds of real time? As it happens, this claim has been investigated by researchers exploring lucid dreaming, and the results indicate that if there is any such effect, it is fairly small. Okay, but does any of this matter? Scientific error is rife in popular entertainment.I'm prepared to argue that Inception's misconceptions are both symptomatic and enabling of a damaging confusion that is rife in American society: namely, that between the internal subjective reality within our minds and the external, universally accessible reality of the ""real world."" It is this confusion that give rise to magical thinking and its myriad manifestations, from prayer-healing to ""The Gift"" and mystical notions about near-death experiences.Confusion about the boundary between dream and reality is particularly endemic among the religiously inclined, who often perceive dreams as the source of real-world information. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Israel, for instance, is located on a spot identified in a dream by the Emperor Constantine's mother, Helena.The perfect metaphor of this movie would be like this:""I liked it,""""I didn't really understand what was going on, but I liked it.""A tad overrated movie that need to be drop out of the top 250 movies list of all time. I'll give him 2 stars for the CGI effects who were indeed well done. That is all."
23421,False,"Di Caprio plays Cobb, an expert in extracting information from people's minds by infiltrating a target's dream. In return for a new identity, which will allow him again to go to the States to be with his kids, Cobb is challenged to now plant an idea in someone's mind in stead of retrieving it.The premise of the film is rather silly but it's the execution that truly ruins the film. The major issue is without a doubt the exposition ridden dialog which didn't progress the overall plot or added anything in terms of character development. In stead we get the most expensive cast doing little else than yammer on and on about the totally uninteresting and far-fetched technical methods that are involved in dream infiltration as Nolan's showcases his unimaginative and clueless take on the Sci-Fi genre. In between these witless and thoroughly boring expositions, we get treated to the action clichés from every Bond movie that has ever graced the silver screen in the past 3 or 4 decades while the pounding soundtrack gets louder and louder simply with every subsequent scene.Where was the conflict in this story needed to create viewer involvement? Who exactly were we expected to root for? Why was everything happening in this film without exception utterly implausible? Why do people find this movie to be complex when the film spends about 95% of the script explaining what is going on. And why wasn't this hapless script nominated for a couple of Razzies?The fans are right, I don't get it."
23422,False,"Inception: pointless mix . Nolan: absolutely _overrated_. DiCaprio: same chewed gum. Conclusion: I want my money back.This is just utter bullshit really. And for sure nothing to be 9.2 ... people should go back and see again real movies..please. Want a real inception? Fightclub, Matrix 1, and many others. But this one? I can hear DiCaprio crying on the phone ' I want to be like Keanu, pleaseeeee', so they put together this script in like what, couple of weekends? and they get Nolan... the most overrated director ever... the result speaks for itself... a pointless mix...at 3/4 of the movie ppl where leaving the theater... dullness empire... bah."
23423,False,"A mess about ""mind pirates""...or something. They enter peoples minds, bend reality and are hired to help a man to change his dying fathers mind to get control of his estate...but there are OTHER people who are trying to stop them.Wow! What a total disaster! This is one of those movies that make so little sense that people just assume they're not intelligent enough to ""get it"" and fall all over themselves praising it. This movie is not some revolutionary trend setter--does anyone remember ""The Matrix"" from 20 year ago? Also it sets up the rules of what's going on at the beginning. That's fine but they're thrown at you so fast and furious (with NO explanation) that I was totally lost. Then, after establishing the rules, they CHANGE them for no other reason than to confuse the plot and throw viewers off. THEN they introduce new rules when we're well into the movie! That's not clever or intriguing--it's playing with the viewers mind and deliberately making them lost and confused. To make it worse the acting pretty much sucks. Ellen Page is horrendous (and her character is never fully introduced or explained) and Joseph Godron-Levitt sleepwalks through his role. DiCaprio (who I THOUGHT was a good actor) is terrible. He gives yet another performance of a man who's tortured by some dark past and trying to get through it. He's done this many times before (""Revolutionary Road"", ""Shutter Island""). Can't he do anything else? Also when he breaks loose and start yelling I didn't believe it for one second and I couldn't take it seriously. I've seen that before! The admittedly great special effects can't help. I walked out after 90 minutes. The movie is constantly pulling the rug out from under the viewers and I got this smug attitude that the filmmakers were having a fun time playing with the viewers and thinking they were smarter than they actually were. Dull, annoying and very full of itself. Don't bother."
23424,False,"I don't know what it is about this movie that people get so carried away with. I guess being under 20 helps, although I talked to some younger friends who thought the movie to be just as insipid, lame and boring as I did.I read that people find this movie's complexity to be one of its strong points. This is quite sad since it's about as complex as the basis of your average video game. I guess that same thing has set the standard to determine what is complex today in films and what is not. Complexity in my book has something to do with multiple layers, each with its own intrinsic appreciation, and is recognized rather easily. The effect namely being that when you miss a significant part of the story, like when watching a good detective, you no longer understand what is going on. I must have at least dozed off 3 times during Inception but wasn't even remotely challenged to work something out that wasn't already all too clear about 15 or 20 minutes in.The characters were unlikable and uninteresting across the board and the same rather goes for the whole of what the movie considers to be its plot. A James Bond type of story arc which doesn't really make the viewer care for it's outcome since such is already pretty clear because Nolan uses the same frigging formula. We got the secret agent, a pretty damsel, a world threat and a plethora of nameless villains with guns, some even on skimobiles! At any given point during ThaT particular scene, I expected a venerable Roger Moore to rush out from behind a snow covered spruce, cunningly herding his chasers into a trap of what appears to be 007's stretchable tie conjoined to and in between two trees.Inception is nothing more than the next action/chase time-waster laced with the compulsory CGI and endless fake-explanatory dialog as if it was breaking down a match between two chess masters. I found it all way too silly and turned it off 15 minutes before the credits rolled. Another cell phone company commercial stretched into feature film length with some big names attached for a complementary audience who can't tell, and couldn't care less to be able to tell, shït from Shinola. 5/10 for the otherwise competent direction, editing and sublime sound editing."
23425,False,"First the good news. The movie contains decent action sequences. The acting is OK, some exceptions left aside.Apart from that, this movie is overrated.The characters are one-dimensional. The story is predictable. About acting, Di Caprio can you make believe everything, except that this is a good movie. The actors try to perform and get something out of the script, but sometimes you can see them struggle and that can not be the purpose.Score is about 9 at the moment of writing, that's higher rated than all movies of Hitchcock... Are you kidding me ?"
23426,False,"stolen from the anime PAPRIKA ,watch paprika and you'll know what i mean. almost every single detail is stolen from it , you call Nolan a genius i call him a thief ,he is a genius in the art of stealing the hall damn thing was a stolen nightmare that am happy that i woke up from ,or did i? too bad i don't have that little stupid thing that DiCaprio uses to know if he woke up from such a nightmare or not cause i see its still ranked high in this site (not that this sites rankings are important any how , i Prefer rotten tomatoes),so that means am still stuck in this nightmare. enough is said cant afford to waste more letters reviewing this piece of overrated trash."
23427,False,"What a let down. Due to the hype and exuberant reviews I had expected something akin to Eternal Sunshine or at least something not totally unlike The Matrix. Instead we get something like 'the Cell' without the lush imagery, but with plot holes so big that even Jorge Garcia would drop through them. So what is it that makes this film so mediocre. 1. The shoot outs and action scenes. Seriously, I've seen better in James Bond films from the early eighties, even if you deem this to be impossible. But what makes those scenes so utterly annoying is that there is no purpose to them whatsoever other than to appeal to people who like to see things go 'bang' and no doubt play first-person shooters in their bedrooms. Those guns don't propel the story forward a single inch.2. The cast. Nothing happens between Leonardo and Marion. There is no spark, no chemistry, thus you can't really understand why Leonardo would consider staying in a dreamworld just to be together with his old flame that he doesn't seem to have any affection for when she was alive.3. The Alibi cutie. If you eliminate Allen Page from the script, no-one would spot the difference. Honestly folks, if the architect of a dream landscape is so important and the wrong fabric of a bathmat can thwart the success of a mission, why don't we get any insight of how this whizz kid designs those dreamscapes and what makes her so indispensable. If we had any inkling what exactly she was doing there apart from looking pretty she would have been far less annoying.4. The aforementioned holes in the plot. Too numerous to mention here, just think about this: if someone who has a dream in a dream and in the first dream he sits in a van that drops down a bridge, there is no logical way he would be weightless in the second dream cause physically he doesn't sit in the van and mentally he doesn't know about the moments without gravity. Dreams just don't work like that and it is an insult to peoples intelligence to suggest that they do.But if all that was not enough, there is so much more inconsistency here, like for instance, why would a tycoon who has the money to buy up entire airlines and the power to overrule the judicial system in America be so utterly afraid of some healthy competition that he risks being lost in his dreamworld for more than thirty years? I think 'good clean fun-loving popcorn movie' is just an euphemism for brainless mainstream crap from America but what is even worse is brainless mainstream crap that claims to be sophisticated. This film certainly is not."
23428,False,"What a disappointment. The idea of thought and dreams and the subconscious being manipulated was so interesting and they took it and made it into one of the most boring films I've ever seen! That I guess was clever. Watching it (and listening to the overblown soundtrack trying to make up for the utter lack of anything actually happening on the screen) was almost as annoying as reading the overblown reviews. Is somebody's mother getting people to log in and say ""wow"".It really is mind boggling that this movie was so well received. It is long, loud, confusing, and devoid of story. Talk about a paradox."
23429,False,"""The mind is like an iceberg, it floats with one-seventh of its bulk above water."" -Sigmund Freud Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" plays very much like its subject matter described so aptly above by Freud. On your first viewing, you will quite possibly only grasp just a fraction of its complexity, but the brilliance of what this reviewer proclaims as Nolan's masterpiece lies in how engaging it is- even though you cannot quite fully comprehend what Nolan is trying to say. Indeed, it may take multiple viewings for one to absorb completely his audacious new creation that dares to tackle as dense and intricate a subject as that of dreams.It isn't easy to understand the nature of dreams, particularly because they seem to defy logic. The same can probably be said of some of the elements in ""Inception"", but in order for one to understand what dreams really are, one has to first accept that they are not part of the conscious mind, and therefore cannot be understood by rationality. Freud proposed that the rational mind is just that one-seventh of the iceberg that we see, and the rest of the mind is made up of the preconscious and the unconscious. Freud also believed that dreams were the road to the unconscious and existed in the preconscious, a state between the conscious and the unconscious mind.It is in this context that Nolan invites his audience to approach ""Inception"". Here, Nolan imagines a world of corporate espionage where a thief enters a person's mind during his dreams to steal ideas. This process he terms ""extraction"", done by a team of people who design the architecture of the dreams, plant several people including the subject into the dream, forge identities within the dream and then proceed to steal the idea from the subject. Leonardo DiCaprio is the master thief of them all, Dom Cobb, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt his long-time right-hand man Arthur.But this latest mission is different- a tycoon Saito (Ken Watanabe) wants him to plant an idea (so termed inception) within a rival's (Cillian Murphy) mind in order that he will break up his ailing father's business empire after he takes over. Cobb agrees to this dangerous mission- a fugitive wanted for the murder of his wife, Saito promises that if Cobb succeeds, he will wipe Cobb's slate clean so he is allowed to return to the United States to see his children. So Cobb begins assembling his team- the architect Ariadne (Ellen Page), the forger Earnes (Tom Hardy) and the chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao)- think of it like a heist, only much more complicated.As Cobb explains the rules of the game to his team while preparing for their mission, Nolan is too establishing the rules of his game to his audience- what it means to die in a dream, why one can feel pain even when you're in a dream, the significance of the people you see in your dream, the difference between dream time and real time. Not to spoil the experience to you- but suffice to say that there are many many such rules that Nolan plays by in his movie. Those who have had some experience in the study of dreams will likely grasp this more quickly, but those who have not may take more time to accept the logic and regulations behind Nolan's world- hence the multiple viewings.Regardless, there is no doubt that it is engrossingly intriguing. All this takes place in the first half of the movie, which sets the stage for the inception itself in the latter half, an ingenious conceit set within a world of layered dreams that defies any description. Nolan uses the interconnectedness of these elaborate dream layers to intercut several breathtaking action spectacles - the storming of a vault within the Arctic within a zero-gravity fight along a hotel corridor within a high-speed vehicular freeway chase. Each of these would be thrilling in their own right, but with Nolan's vision, Wally Pfister's expansive photography and Lee Smith's fine editing, the simultaneous unfolding of these set-pieces is utterly riveting.Besides grand action, Nolan also delivers heart-wringing moments courtesy of Cobb's troubled past with his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who threatens to wreak havoc on his missions by surfacing from his unconscious in the most inopportune manner. We're kept in the dark most of the time, believing that Mal is an insidious presence Cobb is unable to eradicate, but Nolan's reveal towards the end of the film that puts into perspective Cobb's unresolved guilt delivers an emotional finish that will leave you floored.As with his previous movies, Nolan displays a knack for choosing actors who can best embody the characters in his films. While DiCaprio's role here may be reminiscent of that in his earlier Shutter Island, there's no question that he anchors the movie with a perfectly calibrated performance that is equal parts intense and heartfelt. The rest of the supporting characters fill out their roles just as vividly- Joseph Gordon-Levitt radiates confidence and suavity, Ellen Page displays suitable wit and grit, and in particular Marion Cotillard exudes both sultriness and danger in an edgy yet eventually heartbreaking performance.But ""Inception"" is Nolan's vision through and through- and in fact, a visionary director and a master filmmaker at that. Many years Nolan spent refining his screenplay, and it shows in the great detail and complexity that makes ""Inception"" both an intellectual and visceral enjoyment- just take the names of the various characters, each of which have a special significance. With ""Inception"", Nolan invites you to open your mind to possibilities- possibilities of alternate realities, of complexities beyond the conscious mind to grasp and most importantly, of the power of imagination. It is that rare gem of a film that is so multi-layered, so profound and so fascinating that you'll want to experience it again immediately after you've seen it- just so you can fully appreciate its genius."
23430,False,"It's a heist movie with a banal twist, placement rather than extraction. Forget Sigmund Freud and Lewis Carroll. Dreams are misconceived as just a version of reality with some CGI tricks and so we move through conceptual layers rather than anything that might reasonably be passed off as subconscious states. Any ambiguity about what is real and what is dream merely has us guessing about whether any of Nolan's crafted layers of so called consciousness actually matter at all beyond supplying opportunity for clever-clever editing sleight of hand gimmickry.To See Cobb (Di Caprio) and Mal (Cotillard)poncing about in their mental construct with a hand wave that its ordinariness is due to their fondness for modernist architecture (serial reiterations of skyscrapers worthy of a Hanna-Barbera loop)puts paid to any claim that we are witnessing the like of surreality we visit in our sleep. Dreams in this film are nothing but different locations arrived at by means of taking a pill. We sure don't get to see Wonderland.All this leads us to wonder about the entire premise which turns out to be nothing more than a bunch of corporate malarkey. Absorption into the plot rather depends on the audience buying into the elaborately technical internal logic about who has to be where and doing what in various levels of a subject's mind to perform the exercise at hand. That's your mission should you accept it.So if you happen to swallow the director's pill at the outset then Nolan's fake world will draw you in -James Bond's Impossible Oceans Infinity. Take the pill that powers your critical judgment and for a couple of ours you'll find yourself staring at some overblown money drain that invites you to consider the deception that marketing and production gloss can pull off."
23431,False,"I should warn you that the material you're going to see is of commercial nature, especially the way those shiny computerized tricks make you wonder about the inherent nature of your being, your life( probably same as characters) and in this weird piece of crap, dreams which are the very thought-provoking world of unknown elements. I have read a lot on dreams and will tell this with certainty that their efforts to humanize the screenplay are all in vein however taking advantage of pseudo-isochromatic charts. Are we really expected to take shots like this seriously? I can no longer ignore my feeling that we are close to the end of rich cinematic era. As a matter of fact in many situations, being monotone is better than having bad intonation. The worst is when someone goes up and down too much on every word or idea, examples of which can easily be seen in Nolan's Inception which is no longer a commencement, I dare say. I remember a quote cited by a friend in IMDb which goes like: True art is not domineering, It woos you. 1 for bothering reminding me of the likelihood of words meaning not exactly what they are supposed to. Those who rate above 1 ain't seen anything yet."
23432,False,"I didn't like anything about this movie and I don't understand why people rate it high. Why do people lately anyway like movies that are inarticulate? The dreams were stupid and the characters too. Who cares anyway what happens in this film? Usually I can appreciate sci fi movies like Solaris. They are great to me and I enjoy the mystery and the futuristic scenery. But sadly Inception is pretentious and empty. I have to admit, I could only watch it for 1 hour, then I had to leave because it was a waste of my time, I rather do nothing actually. All along the movie the actors kept explaining things, and that killed the integral. I don't know why a wonderful actor like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who has done some very artistic independent movies, wants to play this cardboard man? Leonardo diCaprio in Shutter Island will always be one of my favorite parts ever. You know what? It's that ""Look at me I'm very important"" style of acting that I dislike with Inception. It takes itself way too serious while the plot is no more than a thumbed B comic."
23433,False,"Another phenomenally over-hyped blockbuster from Nolan, which - like all his movies - is nothing else but a pseudo-clever, emotionally cold and pompous high gloss product that's masquerading as intelligent mainstream entertainment.It's such fun to watch all the movie geeks and oh-so literate critics (and almost everyone in between) fall for well-packaged, but thoroughly trivial nonsense like this with such aplomb. It's as if all the stupid action movies and (romantic) comedies Hollywood is churning out regularly have led to a yearning for something more profound... though the big guns and larger-than-life stars are still not to be missed, of course.This one's in the same league as ""Matrix"", though much more elaborate in its twisted ways. (Just listen to the constantly exchanged plot explanations between the characters, which get unintentionally funny after a while.) One watches pics like these applauding the makers, without investing deeper thoughts or emotions. One's much too puzzled to feel anything.By the way, this must've been the longest showdown I've ever seen in any movie. Afterwards, I felt like that ancient Asian guy.5 out of 10 ever-whirling roundabouts"
23434,False,So you can enter somebody's dream and plant an idea and then watch it develop into some big world changing decision/event. Well honestly I'd rather have telepathy to enter somebody's thoughts where I could do a whole lot more but that's not exactly what Inception is about. If I follow the story it was about planting the seed of doubt in a competitor's mind so he would sell him company or something like that. I found a lot of things in this movie pointless and how exactly can u have a dream within a dream within a dream? Isn't that like saying I'm eating a meal within a meal within a meal? Seriously if this was all the studio could come up with I'd rather watch Superman stop a bullet with his invulnerable eye again and again and again.
23435,False,"My wife and I sat down to watch this on Sky HD in eager anticipation given the rave reviews it has been receiving from the critics and on IMDb. How disappointed we were. In our opinion, and the one star review given is an average of our two scores, rounded up to the minimum allowed of one, this has to be one of the worst films ever made. We cannot see any merit in it, on any level, from any aspect. I am not going to give away any of the film other than to say that it is nonsense from beginning to end, and when we say nonsense, that is not because we did not understand it. We understood what was happening, but all the time there was an air of absolute disbelief that anyone could consider this tripe to be entertaining. We watched it all the way to the end just to see what would would happen. We should have given up after five minutes as we considered and watched some snow melt in our garden!"
23436,False,"worst film I saw in a very long time I would have given it a 6 if it wasn't for trying to bring down the hype. It is boring & slow no story Some people told me it is a good and complicated movie. They belong to the group of dumb people who like feel as though they're intelligent This thing is in the top 3 of best movies ever ??? then I do not need to see any movie ever again they are a waste of money and time and yes I did get the plot - it is missing and for those who still want to see this movie don't worry it is not complicated A very personal idea, if I do not look at my watch during the movie it was entertaining (does not have to be good but it caught you) but during this waste of time I have seen the seconds on my watch crawl forward."
23437,False,"This overly-hyped movie tried to be too clever by half and didn't even manage to pull off a Matrix-type pretentiousness. It's just bad, substituting elementary (and wrong) psychobabble for plot. It's science fiction and fantasy, it doesn't have to conform to real life but it should conform to its own rules. The acting was wooden, which is due to the bad script because each of these actors can hold their own elsewhere. The pacing is glacial. We are continually being preached at about the subconscious, but it's all like an Agatha Christie novel, with a surprise, unforeseen and unannounced deus ex machina just popping up here and there to wrap things up. Like, it's really complicated because there are these things called ""levels"" to dreaming and the subconscious. If the director spent ten years writing this script, he should get another job. It looks like it was pasted together in a couple of days over a few too many mai-tais. Some interesting visuals, but that's all there is."
23438,False,"I am beating myself up because I fell for the hype. Unfortunately I spend money on that nightmare, next time I go to a movie which has been so hyped I make sure it is a free screening. It is a nightmare. If you have these kinds of dreams you are a deeply disturbed person. Shooting, car crashes, explosions, shootings, car crashes, explosions that is all that troubled soul dreams about. I usually do not go to movies consisting of shootings, explosions, car crashes and crumbling buildings. Only when I really feel that a movie gives a realistic rendering of war will I go and see such a movie because I am trying to understand that part of human nature. But I went. It was hot and I thought it would be nice to sit in a cool movie theater. Well first the movie theater was warm and I had to fight to stay awake , then they switched the air-conditioning on high and we all got frozen. I was hanging in checking my watch every three minutes and hoping that eventually I would see that great movie people were raving about. Nothing. After 148 painful and boring minutes I tried to getup and leave but was frozen stiff and it took me a few seconds to get moving. The credits had just started rolling but the movie theater was already empty, obviously everybody could not wait to leave. There were only a few people anyway in the afternoon show. This was my first movie in eight months because there was absolutely nothing worthwhile seeing in the theaters nearby. I love to go to the movies and I love the big screen so when the ticket lady asked me if I wanted XP I said yes. I was disappointed by that too. Not worth the money. Hopefully there will some movie I want to see in the coming months, otherwise I will stick to books."
23439,False,"I have never felt more against the critical and commercial spotlight than I did in Inception. I felt it was okay, not bad, but certainly not good. The plot is weighted down by brainless action scenes added by Director Nolan just to keep people watching amidst the confusion. I prefer action that has more relevance when I am watching a film. The film's main focus is dreams, but I did not feel like I was in a dream, only a web of destruction at the hands of computer generated explosions! I think there is a certain creativity in Inception, however it was lost amidst the lack of comprehensive filmmaking and intelligent screen writing."
23440,False,"Based on reviews I was hoping this was a ""different"" American film in the sense that it will have substance, subtlety and that it will make me think. It did not, it did not and it did not again. It is your typical Hollywood flick with car chases, shooting galore, explosions, fistfights, pretty boys and girls - the whole nine yards to sell tickets to the ADHD generation of teenagers. I gave it 3 stars - instead of just 2 - because the special effects are absolutely astonishing. This film wishes to be clever but really is not and does not make a lot of sense either. It reminded me of the teachers/professors who were confusing on purpose in order to make us believe they are smarter than we were."
23441,False,"The only way to describe this movie in one paragraph is it was like the first time a person has sex, it's hyped for about 2 or three years of your life till finally it's prom and you got the parents station wagon and you got a hotel in the country all set up for your first big night of love. Then you go to pick your date up and she's gotten braces over the weekend. OK, not the worst thing in the world. Then you slip and fall while shaking the dads hand and karate chop his balls and grab her mothers blouse and rip it off on the way down. Then on the way to the prom you get a flat and you go and change it and you get oil all over your tux. Then you go to the prom and you think it'll be so cool now that more people are being added to the mix. But it's not, and it sucks because there's now so much sexual tension built at this time the dudes don't wanna dance for fear of boners and the girls don't want to for the same reason... Then you finally leave and get out to the hotel and you think ah well, this whole night was crap but this will redeem it. This will make it all better... Then you realize she's got braces... And her hymen's still intact... And what ensues is 20 minutes of nothing but blood, pain, and screams of agony coming from both parties till eventually you can't even look at her anymore and you wont be able to jerk it for a month now because your scabbed penis needs time to heal.... Yeah thats what inception was like to me....Stick with Momento...esk stuff dude"
23442,False,"Disappointed, Oh yes I am Disappointed. Why, Because I had high expectations. Why I had High Expectations? Because Nolan's History of Film making was what I was confident about. Memento, The Dark Knight are the two Movies which got a 10/10 and 9/10 rating from me respectively. But Inception, It was neither Memento, Nor The Dark Knight. It was more of a screenplay forcing you to believe it and to make it look genuine BUT with flawed ways and formulaic techniques which didn't work for me.Other than that it was fine. Visuals, Performances, Editing were all fine and the Camera Used for the movie was not the perfect choice. Direction as usual was POWERFUL but it was the story that didn't really appealed me.It is a movie with fine content but a forcing (in a wrong way) story. 6/10. And I am not crying its over-rated since most of people have really liked it."
23443,False,"I was keen to see this film given the high IMDb rating, as I agree with nearly all ratings I've seen on the site, but I appear to be one of the minority who think it is overrated. I couldn't emotionally engage with the characters for some reason, and so was not too concerned on the outcome for them.Whilst there were some complexities to the plot, it is reasonably easy to understand. I agree with some other comments I've seen that many characters accepted the quite fantastical premise very readily, and were prepared to place themselves at considerable risk for no real reason. So some reactions were not what you would expect for the situation.Having had time to reflect I would watch the film again, but do not think I will keep coming back to this unlike the Matrix which has a similar feel but is a much better film."
23444,False,"Inception is a lie and like all legitmate hollywoods irregardless of who is doing what to whom there is only the technology that allows this hysterical calculator(that is all this film represents) in this motion picture to perhaps make money.There seems not much more to suggest and that would be if this film made money,? Well did it ? This is what is a most unusual point to all this,and that would be if this particular film did not make money what else is this film doing if in fact it did not make money? What is required to know better or perhaps to truly know well what the viewer is looking at when as a viewer,the viewer as it were watches the motion picture ""Inception"".There is as well another consideration and that is if in fact the very participation in the watching of any motion picture is such an experience as to be a unwholesome experience. I believe it is that(unwholesome) and even more so provides for a disguise so to mislead any who might be drawn for what ever reason to watch such a film or for that matter to watch such are the films of Hollywood,California.There is no degree of involvement in the making of this film that is in fact authentic and as illegitimate that that might sound like it is an illegal search and seizure which allows a thief to be masqueraded as the man with the candy.This film is not new nor is this film what it appears as is as well.The result when viewing such a film is that there is no time that is real nor is there a place as to any particular event is concerned and if that isn't enough there is no definition as to not if there is a capacity to dream but how do we provide the ability to interject another ability that could pass as a dream.This is the handiwork of a masquerade with any here who believe believe not in this motion picture as there is no dreaming there is only the ability to transmit the stimulus with the image that is what masquerades as a ""dream"".It is as well imposed upon the body of the human race so to provide a unmistakable influence.The influence as the film provides such a witness has a goal of influence pure and simple this film is merely more of the same as the same has meant since as it were its inception.It is its invention that is at the source of this worlds ability to influence anything with merely more of the same being all that the viewer will ever be looking at.The inventor as well as the inventors many inventions are all patented and do it is believed remain so.There were some 700 separate inventions with which this unwholesome day in this world occurred when one Nicola Tesla discovered how to bind energy across wide open space many many miles from nowhere including even deepest darkest space.This is the field of regard it is as well the ability to network with many disparaging elements so to influence even say Adolf Hitler(I kid you not).Though 1920 is the year of radio's invention and 1921 the year Berlin radio started to broadcast it was a good time before this point in time that Tesla's inventions and subsequent patents were in place.The better premise would be to know through Tesla's own words as to what capacity does what he invented provide and without to much trouble Tesla's's own misgivings provide for the very problem of being under the influence of a lie.Though this lie was not meant to interfere with the human race that is exactly what has occurred.The money men of Teslas's own day are at the root cause as to the necessity to influence anything outside of an antenna.They remain as perhaps a cog in the wheel that very nearly saw to its conclusion not to long ago.This wasn't Tesla's design this was there influence on his attempt to bind energy that it was not to be unless of course they could extract a measure if you will of revenge upon humanity.This is the masquerade that there is a profit motive in this foreign power as well as an aggression not to be deterred in its inability to be regulated properly.This is an imperfect science which has meted out suffering through this field of regard.(network field)It is this thief in the night and it is as well the exploiter of human flesh that this film is providing the viewer with.This is what this film is up to and it has been such since it inception."
23445,False,"This had a lot of talented actors and some nice visual effects. Sadly I could not get into the story this movie was trying to convey. Just didn't make sense to me.Leonardo has been in two flops that I just saw within a year and the other is Shutter Island.. I wouldn't waste your time trying to watch either of these movies. In closing I always like to see Ken Watanabe.Some movies that were similar to this that I really liked were the Matrix and The Fountain. This movie is nowhere near the caliber of those movies and I find it hard to compare this movie to anything, but way - WAY over rated. I really liked the movies Knight and Day with Tom Cruise and recommend that and also Resident Evil : Afterlife with Milla Jovovich."
23446,False,"I thought this movie was going to very good and had to wait a few days for it to show up available at the Red Box kiosk. I rented a second movie as well and put that one on first in anticipation that Inception would be my ""special"" movie of the evening.Well, it was not special at all. I quit about halfway through. I kept thinking to myself that everything you saw must be a dream and maybe it was but I could not sit through the whole thing. All of the criticisms have been levelled at this movie already and I won't repeat them and just add that I endorse those that happened before half of the movie was done. I did enjoy Momento but not this load of tripe."
23447,False,"Very, very overrated film. Worth seeing in the cinema for the visual effects but would never buy the DVD. The acting is good but the content lacks a truly engaging story line. It lures you in but never manages to hook you. They shouldve explored other characters rather than Cobb. It seems to me as though the film could've been pulled off with a less talented supporting cast. Also it is slightly confusing in some parts. Other parts are way too predictable. This is NOT the MIND BLOWING film people talk it up to be. Those people out there who say this is a GREAT film are mistaken. Although in saying that it stills scores a solid 5/10. Cam"
23448,False,"Look I am a fan of Chris Nolan or at least I used to be. His movies are always different and I liked them. Prestige was the first movie that I watched of him and I loved it. The Dark Knight was the movie that I had the highest expectations and it did not let me down. I know there are 10 things not to like The Dark Knight but for me there were 1000 things to like. But this time I AM disappointed. Inception is like the cutest car that can't run very fast. It has its good looking but no good plot and a million questions about the concept.There are a few simple rules about a science fiction movie or story. When you watch one there are things you feel right or not. You can use your wildest imaginations but at some point they have to make sense. This film certainly did not feel right. This was like a low budget science fiction which starts well but loses it after a while except for this was a big budget movie! Well there ARE a few things to like about this movie. It has a good concept, good graphics and good acting. If the plat was better and a few more things made more sense this could have been the masterpiece everyone thinks it to be."
23449,False,"Is it just me, or was this unintelligible? Not just 'hacking' into someone's dreams but manipulating their thoughts inside Dreamworld. And then, to add to the confusion, we had dreams within dreams within dreams! If the complex plot had an internal logic which appeared not to defeat Leonardo DiCaprio - it certainly defeated me. There is considerable homage to the MATRIX films, with aerial fights and frozen motion sequences: kid's stuff, but what do kids make of the anarchic storyline? If you die in someone else's dream, you can either wake up alive or go to a place called Limbo (not the same as the one Dante envisaged) which looked like the flooded New York of The Day After Tomorrow a few decades on. The plus side of Limbo for Leo was that it reunited him with his dead wife (Marion Cotillard), but was this his limbo or hers? Best not to ask.If MEMENTO, with time running backwards, was Christopher Nolan's ""set text"" for Filmgoing GCSE, I guess INCEPTION represents A-Level movie comprehension.And I seem to have failed."
23450,False,"*** This review may contain spoilers *** May be I expected too much from this movie, which was supposed to ""change the way I see things"". Well, it did not change anything, and certainly not the way I look at things. May be it changed the way I look at people who think this is the best movie ever made.It's long, tedious, they go through layers after layers, why, we do not really know. The characters are numerous, flat, (some may argue that this is a dream so they are supposed to be flat), but strangely enough they are quite consistent, they never change, which is not consistent at least with my dreams.And if you ask people why this movie is so fascinating and ""complex"", you might end up with the following conversation: ""it can not be explained with words, it's a story about a guy who gather a team to go through different layer of dreams to alter, blah."" ""Yes, I got that and?""""But I can't tell you the whole plot, I might spoil it"" ""I saw it, try me."" ""Euh, his wife blah blah... about the dream thing, life, death, redemption, there are so many themes in this movie"" ""And?"" ""Euh, I don't know, you need to think."" ""Ah...""I guess many people confuse complexity and redundancy. These guys just go through layers and layers of dreams, wrapped non-sense pseudo-scientific verbiage. Than he sees his wife again and again, and ""kicks"" back again and again, fights again bad guys again and again. And what? This is not complex, this is redundant and boring!Many people mentioned to me that there was a trick at the end of the movie... Actually, the end is a kind of pale copy of Orange Clockwork ending, and you can expect the trick from the beginning. Orange clockwork, the hurt locker, usual suspect, this is how you end a movie, and I did not see it coming from the first 15 minutes of the movie.In the category ""the director tries to drive you crazy"", Donnie Darko, Mulholland drive and, if we stick to Nolan universe, Memento gets my vote, not Inception. Or go watch Matrix again, or Dark city, or whatever movie you want to, that lasts less than 2 hours.Bottom line, I was bored during the projection, and that's one of the worst movie I've ever seen. 2 points because I did not leave (which makes it a better movie than Titanic to me)."
23451,False,"I truly cannot understand why anyone would call this a good film. Fancy special effects, yeah, plenty many lots... but special effects do not make a film. It also needs a storyline that doesn't shoot in every direction, left, right, backwards and forwards throughout the entire film for lack of substance.OK, so the dude wants to plant an idea in someone's brain. Got that after a minute or so of viewing. And then what? It feels too much like a storm in a teacup.Frederic Dard (french novelist) used to describe futuristic gadgets by means of expressions like ""he's pointing a gloombobber with spiral condensing palchromium in my direction"" but, being a talented writer, he had the good taste of limiting such eccentric nonsense to a single sentence per book, whereas Inception is made up of nothing but that from beginning to end. Each time the dream-team runs into a potential nag, there comes a gloombobber out of a hat. Too predictable after a while. ""This can't be done in a three-dimensional space... no problem, we'll do it in seven!"" would be an adequate tag-line for Inception.I couldn't follow the storyline and am not convinced there actually was one. It reminded me of the Brownian movement observed at the surface of a pot of boiling water. It was so confusing that switching actors every two minutes for the part of the main character would have gone unnoticed in this maelstrom of nonsensical garbage.In conclusion I don't see any point in watching Inception unless you're extremely high on speed or a fan of special effects who doesn't give a whoopdeedo about well-constructed stories in the first place."
23452,False,"I'll be the first one to admit that INCEPTION is the kind of thinking man's thriller that has something going on every second of its two-hour and 28 minute running time. But only director Chris Nolan knows what it's all about and I don't believe I'll find out all the explanations until I get the DVD commentary.It's a heady mixture of sci-fi, comic book stuff and fantasy and all of it is focused on the mastery of dream invasion in order to gather secrets held in the human mind. Foremost among the players is LEONARDO DiCAPRIO, playing his role in a very authoritative manner with no shortage of barking orders and furrowed brow, all highly intense, as he gathers a team around him to investigate the dreamscape.There's plenty of action along the way, interspersed with quieter moments of explanatory dialog so the audience has at least some semblance of what's going on. But the whole concept of the story lacks the kind of credibility that would have made the film more engaging than it really is.Credit the actors with doing their best despite the fact that none of them have roles that are fully fleshed out. And this includes Joseph GORDON-LEVITT, ELLEN PAGE, TOM HARDY, CILLIAN MURPHY, KEN WATANABE and TOM BERENGER.If you're a MATRIX fan, you'll love this one. If not, you may wonder what all the fuss was about.Frankly, I had more fun exploring dream invasion in NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, less intellectual but a lot more fun."
23453,False,"Visually interesting and innovative, yet pretentious. It has an excellent cast with great performances. The complexity of its story works perfectly in the way of confusing us. It's easy to think that something that we don't fully understand is great. It's easy to see how so many people liked the film so much. There are plenty of alleged subtleties and symbols which the fans are so eager to comment. Everyone can write a script that is complex. It only needs not be completely logic.I prefer a narrative that is simple but at the same time thick. This is harder to do.Far from being a masterpiece, extremely overrated."
23454,False,"In the future, the industrial spy Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) has the ability to steal secrets from the dreams of executives. When his beloved wife committed suicide in the past, he was falsely accused of murder and now he is an international fugitive that can not return to USA to be with his children. When Cobb meets the powerful Saito (Ken Watanabe), the executive offers a unique chance to him to clear his records. In return, Cobb shall plant an inception in the mind of the heir Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) to avoid that the company he had inherited from his father becomes a monopoly in energy in the future. Cobb lost the capability to build dreams and together with his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), they team up with the trainee in architecture Ariadne (Ellen Page); with the expert Eames (Tom Hardy); and with the chemistry Yusuf (Dileep Rao) to enter in different levels of Robert's dream and plant the inception.""Inception"" is an overrated mess and my greatest deception in 2011. I do not understand the hype surrounding this film, probably the fruit of the market campaign of smart producers that lure naive viewers that seem that does not think and understand how flawed and stupid this story is. The plot is developed in fast pace to force the viewer to not think, with incoherent rules that do no make sense and that change in each layer of the dream in accordance with the intention of the writer. The best part of this film is the hilarious IMDb User Rating that reflects how brainless the Hollywood cinema has become in the contemporary days. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""A Origem"" (""The Inception"")"
23455,False,"Over the top special effects movie that overshadow the plot and interesting concept. Actually a very very simple plot. Visually excellent, if you are impressed with studio effects that you see in so many action movies. I guess.Simple plot line but complicated presentation that left me lost twice lost until about 10 minutes later. Then, ""I got it."" After one or two of those you get the hang of it. This is how the movie is structured  they tell you and then reinforce. Kindergarten for adults. It is all very clear but you have to pay attention The problem is the action scenes are over the top. How many snow chases have you seen? There are bad guys that can't shoot and good guys who seem to be wimps that beat the heck out of the soldiers and thugs. This isn't real life. How many times do we need to watch the fight scene in the hotel hallway? Why do they go on and on? Boy is this tedious! There is a lot of time and special effects used for a simple plot line.It's a ying and yang movie. I guess I would call it a cognition or attribution movie coupled with overly done, seen it before shoot it up scenes used to present what were interesting concepts. It is simple action movie and I think it could have been a thinker's movie."
23456,False,"I'm rather happy so many people like this film. It confirms my opinion of mankind. Other reviewers have pointed out the stupidity of this film and I advise everybody to go to the 'hated it' section of the reviews at IMDb and read up a bit about the true nature of this movie. It stinks. It is a corpse that has been underwater too long. It is terrible. It's just another Hollywood production with people running from bullets and never getting hit while too loud droning music tries to add tension where it is simply not there. Sure, there's things exploding and amazing visuals and allegations to human themes (without of course ever becoming real human emotions; allegations are much safer and more popular, because you don't have to actually feel, you can just sit back and go 'oooooh, aren't we amaaaaazing' - well, no, not really), there are characters that are never ever real people - I choose life over the dream here, really, and I hope my dreams never become as lousy as what I see here. In my dreams I feel, I touch, I smell. I dream music and books, I dream people, despair, tears. I dream violence, pain, sex, even death. I have stupid dreams in which I simply work, like I do all day. I sometimes run marathons and wake up exhausted. All these dreams are dear to me, because they are me. This film is not me, or anyone. Even my worst nightmare is preferable over this. At least I feel something there. My tiniest memory of someone I have loved is worth more than this film. A fragment of my capacity to hurt has more energy than this. I could go on, but you get the drift. I rarely give up on films, but this one I did. I quit after 45 minutes. And no, I'm not going to give it another go. As Hemingway said: 'I don't have to eat a whole bucket of snot, to know that it's snot.' One star for me trying to watch this."
23457,False,"Christopher Nolan's sci-fi thriller might well have been called 'Deception', or better still, 'Multiple Deception', such is the effect the film has. The concept is original, no question. However, it does borrow from classic American films such as 'Citizen Kane' and 'The Matrix'.Many film geeks  and ordinary punters  have described this film as 'very complicated'. The truth is it's just tremendously detailed. For his job, Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), while in a dream state, steals ideas from people ('Extraction'); however, the film concerns itself with him implanting an idea into a person's mind, i.e. 'Inception'. That's the plot in one crude line.However, to reduce the plot, which took a modern master nearly eight years to flesh out, to one purely about mental thievery would be unfair. It is the minutiae which are meant to dazzle.Business tycoon, Saito (Ken Watanabe) needs Cobb to perform the inchoate process of Inception on another businessman's son, Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), to prevent his father's energy company from becoming a monopoly. After Fischer Snr passes, it is believed that he will betroth the business to his son, so the idea Cobb and his team must implant is for him to repudiate his father's will.The technology used to carry out the subconscious subterfuge is never explained. When we catch glimpses of it, it looks like a child's primitive science-kit thrown into a briefcase. But this is not meant to be the focus.For all its cerebral conceit, at the film's core are two emotional stories. One is of Cobb's wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who spends her time stalking Cobb's subconscious mind and thereby sabotaging his missions. The other is between Fischer and his father, whose relationship is strained.We saw DiCaprio mature in Martin Scorsese's 'The Departed'. Here he permanently loses the schoolboy image and becomes a man. The ensemble acting is good, however, most of the main characters seem far too young to do anything let alone steal and implant ideas, and Michael Caine's turn as yet another sage is fast becoming trite.The computer-generated imagery is, as expected, top-notch, though the action scenes would be clichéd if they were not embellished by Hans Zimmer's superbly suspenseful music.Ultimately, Nolan asks us to absorb too much gobbledegook too quickly. Perhaps he was being pretentious, perhaps not. Either way, I lost interest somewhere in the second half.Within days of the film's release, thousands of cinema-goers cast their votes on this venerated website, ensuring that the film became, at least in their minds, one of the top five greatest films of all time. So much for polls.www.scottishreview.net"
23458,False,"Not much more to add really. I managed to watch this farce for about half an hour, I desperately wanted to give it a chance, but every passing minute is such an insult to my intelligence that I cannot carry on. Then I tried again to continue, because I thought it's not fair to rate a movie without watching it to the end. But then again, I'm not a masochist.This film is the perfect example of how movie success depends hardly on movie quality, but almost solely on marketing. The same happened with the Matrix a few years back. Farcical setting, totally unrealistic story, but great marketing: Box office success.You probably already know the deal, unfortunately I was unsuspecting before I tried to watch it: Getting into other people's dreams, creating a believable world in the dream where multiple dreamers can interact with each other, and in this way, collect important information from the mark. Of course the dreams also have dreams within, and it's hard to know what is real and when your're dreaming.Whatever. No idea why anyone would WANT to watch this, other than because of the hype. But the hype has very little to do with the quality of the film.This film's whole focus is on the farcical notion of creating dreams for people, and especially, interacting with other characters in the dream who are dreaming the exact same dream. If the film were not so consumed by this outragous technicality, and it had some character and heart, some sort of purpose, I could probably let slip the ridiculousness of the whole theme. I have been known to enjoy the odd sci-fi. But it lacks any heart, all it does is try to look smart.I find it grossly unfair that this junk rates above 9 on IMDb. However, my rating of 2 is not because I want to bring the total down, it is rather what I think the realistic rating is. And that 2 is a very generous score."
23459,False,"For a film of this kind to work there are (at the very least) three script-writing requirements: a) internal logic, b) characters with depth, and c) the complete omission of wise-a*s gimmickry.The film fails on all three counts.I liked the avalanche; I liked the freight train. I laughed at the Kubrick tributes. Beyond that, the thing was too simple for words - but dressed up to be a deep and meaningful experience. You know you are watching a loser when an elevator takes you up and down the guy's consciousness. An elevator? Now who dreamed that up?World domination? A Japanese accent that is unintelligible? Cartoonish characters of all shades (to sell tickets?) Two female leads, one of whom is frighteningly out of whack with the film's storyline (she doesn't understand anything, but is designing the project!), and the other wandering through scenes meant to be scary but - hey, you need to be able to act first, and it would help to then act scary.This film is a mess - except for the avalanche and freight train."
23460,False,"I have just read some of the bad reviews on Inception ,and I have to say that I totally agree with them.This movie is absolutely overrated,it's humorless,pretentious,overlong,underacted,repetitive....But for me,the worst thing is that it's a strange case of a boring heist movie (strange because heist movies are generally entertaining ones).Considering that,apparently in dreams,everything is so much complicated hadn't it been much easier doing it for real ? I think the real INCEPTION the movie is referring to,is the idea that this movie is actually good. May be I was not dreaming that day !!!"
23461,False,"Watch out - the amount of intelligent scriptwriting you accredit this funny movie with may be surprisingly linear to the lack of simple scientific knowledge and common sense you might possess!I simply CAN NOT believe that this movie has a 9.1 rating on IMDb. It makes me question a) the people or b) people who take time to write reviews. This is actually my first comment here and its catalyzed by the imposing will to set one thing straight: It is an absolutely average Hollywood flick and the first that made me question Leo's decision. I became a fan of this excellent acting in the recent years but it was actually painful to listen to the randomly pulled together pseudo-scientific plot. If you know anything about what they try to make up you will start laughing or continue to watch and hope for the good stuff to start. The action was good and the movie definitely has it's moments but I couldn't ""enjoy"" it until the last hour.Watch it if you can be easily pursued into a poorly presented idea, believe it and be drawn into it. And there seems to be nothing else worth watching right now - unless you check some aspiring independent movies.Don't watch it if you like sci-fi that is believable and passionate. This one is one lame attempt -or just a blown up money grab. As overrated as Batman."
23462,False,"Inception rated 12 of all films,above for instance of ALL OF HITCHCOCK'S FILMS.The problem and it isn't about rating movies only ,but let's say ,discussing who is the best footballer of all time ,or which is the best musician etc,IS that young people ,who are the majority of those who are familiar to the internet and go and write reviews ,haven't seen great people in their lifetime and can't comprehend what their real value was.It's different to listen from other people about Pele or Maradona than actually watch them ,when they were in their prime.It's different to listen from other people about the Beatles ,than actually understand what was going on, when they performed in the 60's.So OK,i won't be surprised if Justin Bieber on an online survey is higher than the Beatles ,because the teenagers are 70-90% of all internet users.So that leads to unbelievable PERVERSED results,like this above.In 10 years time the DVD version of this ""masterpiece"" might be selling 20-30 copies all over the world(not thousands).I think it's the only film ,that IMDb shouldn't care about spoilers,because you can't spoil a storyline that doesn't exist. Ridiculous ,shockingly bad,laughable but clever(clever in that they succeeded, in taking money from my pocket, for watching it).When i have watched over maybe 5000 films ,i used to gloat that i can smell from kilometers away the ""potatoes""(a phrase that means really really bad films).Not any more.Maybe when i reach 10000 films, i will have the power to save my self from the next Inception."
23463,False,"Alright folks, I saw the same movie you saw. My wife and I both went into this with great expectations. Visually, the movie was interesting. Beyond that, it was ho-hum for us. I felt myself fidgeting in the seat several times wondering when they were going to get to the point. The film was about 45 minutes too long. The concept is very interesting, but there are so many loopholes and unanswered questions and illogical contrivances that we both just shook our heads and enjoyed the scenery. I have to wonder where all of the high ratings for this flick are coming from. I am not buying that as many people loved this thing on the same par as Lord of the Rings and Godfather. This movie was so pumped up that I was hoping for something brilliant like The Matrix. I feel like I got something more similar to ""The Happening""."
23464,False,"The special effects were great but the science was so flawed in this movie that it was incredible. The storyline made absolutely no sense at all. It also appears to be a bad ripoff of the Matrix (can you say the Architect). Even more illogical is the fact that if the ""Architect"" can create stairs, doors, or even an entire dream environment at will, why can't they fly, destroy anything they want any way they want, or make themselves invisible. At least in the Matrix Neo could fly.The movie just contradicts all of its own rules. People were falling all over the place throughout different dream states but no one woke up, even though a sense of falling wakes you up. Even worse was the supposed technology used to put everyone in the same dream. I don't even want to get started with that one but a pair of ear-buds just will not do it. I really think we need to stress science a little more in our schools.It was pretty cool looking though."
23465,False,"""Inception"" might have been a better movie -- and would certainly have been more entertaining -- had writer/director Christopher Nolan not made his premise so complicated that the film had to spend its entire 2:25 running time explaining itself to its audience.Seriously, the exposition Never. Stops. There were literally moments during action sequences where one character would pause and explain what was going on to another character, which of course was a ham-fisted way of explaining it to us. But even with all of that aggressive exposition, the movie never does make a lot of sense. The result is a lot of busyness -- oh, there's always plenty of stuff going on -- that's nevertheless pretty boring because it's never clear what all of the busyness is for.Nolan has done this to us before. Who the hell came out of ""The Prestige"" with any clue what that movie was about? And even his more narratively coherent films (like ""The Dark Knight"") suffer from a lack of humor and a burden of philosophical pondering that the premises can't support. ""Inception"" is no exception (ha!). The movie is junk trying to disguise itself as something important and significant. How much more fun it would have been if it had just been content to be junk.Grade: C-"
23466,False,"From the suggestion of this film and numerous ads on TV during the films release I had the idea it might follow through with some of DiCaprio's better choices of scripts in recent years.Unfortunately after a long wait for the DVD release in my local rental kiosk, the rental became available a month after the commercial release.Sadly Inception was barely worth the dollar rental.Alluring special effects don't help the fact a confusing intellectual premise eventually degrades into a standard machine gun shoot em up.Very disappointing."
23467,False,"Damn this film rates high on IMDb, but I am not one for ratings. I think a great film is like food, we have all different taste, and this did not taste well for me. Sure it's glossy, great special effects, great cast. But this film is all over the place, just to many angle's with in an angle. Leonardo has made some great films, but after Shutter Island I became less of a fan. I rate Shutter Island only slightly better, but both are a let down for me. I am sure lots of people will dislike my take on this over hyped film, what kills the story for me, it has all these different layers inside layers, sure the idea is O.K but it is not very well done in this film, just one big mess of special effects, that leaves me just feeling very flat. I gave it a 3 out of 10, as visually it is pleasing."
23468,False,"For a film that deals in the world of dreams this film lacks a lot of imagination. I think that in being a Hollywood blockbuster it had to tick a certain amount of boxes that are necessary for the monumental amounts of money that are thrown at it.The first 30 minutes I was interested by the concept and the pacing of the film. The concept of espionage within a dream is an interesting enough concept. I was very open and excited by the idea of going into the world of dreams with the characters. I wish they could have perhaps explored a little more and pushed the boundaries of the dreams. It seemed that time and space flowed a little too seamlessly. Perhaps Kafka's 'The Trial' or a more Cronenberg style would have helped.After the first 30 minutes it sunk into the normal plodding of a Hollywood blockbuster. Are we watching Mission Impossible or a film about dreams? Unfortunately the last two thirds of the film were more Mission Impossible. I couldn't help thinking of the could have beens. All I remember is a van falling for two hours, some irrelevant action scenes in the tundra, and an in-durable no gravity scene which had me yawning.Oh and am I the only one who cannot stand Marion Coutillard?"
23469,False,"There is no doubt that Nolan is a very talented director, and I like a lot of his films, but sadly I think like a number of other hugely successful directors before him (Peter Jackson springs to mind) his success has led to a detrimental degree of freedom for him to churn out his own poorly-written scripts unchecked, and make films that are about an hour longer than they need to be. I know I'm swimming against the tide of public opinion here, but while I was hugely excited about seeing Inception back when it came out, I was absolutely crushed on first viewing. I found it terribly written (the film begins with enough exposition scenes to fill a normal film's running time!), incomprehensible (editing was all over the place, action dull and repetitive), visually disappointing (all the best bits were revealed in the trailer and were all contained in the exposition scenes rather than having anything to do with the story) and with a concept that just didn't hold water (the dream sequences seemed to always resemble Matrix out-takes and were held together by a logic that just wasn't very dream-like)!Perhaps if Nolan had a studio breathing down his neck and someone to revise his shaky script this could have turned out well, but after the success of TDK he can effectively write his own ticket and is (sadly) free to churn out this kind of lazy and self-indulgent snooze-fest. The same thing happened with Peter Jackson after LOTR with King Kong (an hour too long, too much freedom etc.)Hans Zimmer's incredible score was about the only positive I took out of Inception (Zimmer's brilliant scores are increasingly the glue that holds Nolan's films together and makes them seem better than they are). Despite his obvious talents and love of film (I love him for shooting Batman stuff in IMAX 70mm!) Nolan has some very bad habits (mainly relying on his and his brother's writing) which I think really hamper his films these days. I loved TDK, but it frustrates me in almost equal measure, and though I haven't seen The Dark Knight Rises yet, I will go in with very low expectations based on his apparently dwindling form."
23470,False,"Inception makes the average moviegoer feel smart and I would have zero problem with that,unless fans weren't so extremely elitist and condescending. I DO get it...and neither love or hate it. Limited vocabulary but maybe a good read?DiCaprio has reached such super-stardom that can only be compared with Stallone,Schwarzenegger and Will Smith. Meaning:No matter who stars alongside him,he's the only one who sells the film.Just like in Shutter Island,Inceptions trailer only mentions LEONARDO.DICAPRIO.If Watanabe,Cotilliard,Murphy and the rest(Oscarwinners and Oscarnominees,come on) co-star,I might want to know. Studios,respect actors...and ON PAPER,the mix of actors intrigues. Plotwise though,it's all about Mal.Nolan had all the time he wanted to create a caper that was provocative or involved fates of main characters,danger! Morally ambiguous maybe! Yet,planting the seed in a business-mans head that selling his fathers company is his own idea is the result. HOW PG and unpersonal can we get? No room for both a new concept,a bold plot and developed characters...? Nope. Understand it could've been to get a mail-man to call in sick the next day,heist irrelevant. 80% of Inception evolves around the caper,still it merely becomes window dressing,a distraction from the core,the human heart that occasionally beats,being the relationship between Dom and his bad conscience in the shape of Cotilliards Mal.All scenes involving her are superb,it's a nuanced performance worthy of an Oscarnomination. Mal is dangerous,sad,disturbed, beautiful and Very dead. One scene especially involving a ledge is great,heartbreaking cinema. That the person who's most alive and complex is deceased..Paradox...but a good hint at the misuse of actors.Several actors could just've switched names,their characters don't have personalities. What did you do here,Christopher? They describe rules for the dreamworld,dream-extraction,describe what's happening at the moment, that's it.When Swick casted Watanabe in The last samurai,he knew the screenplay matched the mans potential. Nolan has with Batman begins and Inception twice wasted his talent...Murphy? Think I rather see him type-casted as sophisticated sociopaths alá Red Eye then see him as a blank page.Inception's the star and while a detailed construction, intentionally confusing and complex,you DO have to pay attention,complex does not equal intelligent. As you take the ride,things move fast and you're not allowed to break and examine. It's only when it's over you realize you were standing still all along. You are cleverly manipulated into believing the story makes you think(Cause you understand what you saw.Not the same..)or that your mind discovers philosophical metaphors. That you are witnessing something deep is shoved down your throat but depth is mostly absent.Sure,the film deserves the Oscars. Things sound great,look great. Buildings become bridges. An orgasm for the eyes. Pfisters camera-work here is great,very colorful,crisp,clean. Imaginative art direction. I dig Zimmers less-is-more score. In general the whole film's eye candy,perfect surface. The inside...?1.Alright,WAY too much shooting and ""violence"" going on here, considering everyone's sound asleep on a plane and thoughts are murdered. Would've been more intriguing with psychological tension instead of train-crashes and explosions but lack of a REAL physical threat only manages to turn suspense into a dream as well. Sleeping boy vs. thought in zero gravity is so pointless,the impressive CGI just confirms Nolans smug self-awareness of his competent,VISUAL execution and just cements the surface statement. 2. Limbo. Wouldn't a dream-extractors worst nightmare be LIMBO,wouldn't it come up in a conversation between professionals at some point probably? No...not even mentioned until drama occurs. 3.For the 5th time,a womans accidental death consumes a wealthy,white man between 30 and 35 with guilt that will define him and her role is again pivotal. It's getting old and predictable,I hope the issues are worked out by now.4.Last scene. It defines and sums up Inceptions feeling of surface reaching for depth and jaw breaking response,artistic pretensions,strained complexity for the sake of complexity rather then genuinely clever. Nolan in desperation wants to wrap it up so it leaves us scratching our heads... I was banging my head against the seat in front of me when the end credits rolled.He leaves you with two options,no scenarios or reasons that make or should make you come up with an own conclusion. Far from a thinking mans thriller. One of the two is a joke used when referring to funny,lousy twists in B-thrillers. So... No why or how,just IF...IF films were people,Nolans own Memento,The usual suspects or Fight Club would blush,look at 8.8 and put a pistol in their mouth when the words""Smart,thought-provoking thriller"" puts Inception next door to them. The ending insults us,a cop out. Definition of a writer not knowing neither how to quit while ahead or how a journey is gonna reach a classic destination worthy of the plots seemingly intricate layers and ambitions. Sooo...he passes the ball to you and washes his hands with 15 seconds to go,smart lad. A picture this celebrated for being smart should hold up under a magnifying glass. It burns up without you even turning it towards the sun,man. This is an experiment and Nolans monster looks good,but at times,it comes close to the IQ of Dr.Frankensteins creation. DiCaprio gives a solid and mature performance,Hardy makes the most of what little the script offers and gives Eames mannerisms,charisma and a sense of humor. Cotilliard is amazing like stated.The rest could've been portrayed by Gary Busey,Eric Roberts and Lindsay Lohan...Nolans 1st failure is a mix of beauty,superficial intelligence and posturing. Caught between a flawed,pretty entertaining film and a bad one. Mediocre becomes bad when it comes to this director....so shallow."
23471,False,"This is not a bad film per se, had it been about 30-40 minutes shorter I would not have been too offended. But I am genuinely perplexed as to how people can rave over it - #13 on all time list at time of writing!! There is virtually no character development, the plot is overly complicated and riddled with holes and contradictions. Frankly you don't need to suspend disbelief so much has have it surgically removed and flushed down the toilet. By the end I was wishing I was in a dream within a dream policed by a completely arbitrary set of nonsense rules - anything to get me out of that chair.Is this really the same man who gave us Memento??"
23472,False,"Boring movie with no meaning and only a few fancy special effects. Special effects were not even all that good. Just a few slow motion anti-gravity scenes. Even the Matrix would have been boring without some kind of ""meaning of life"" stuff. You need more than star power to make a good movie. I kept thinking the movie would have intriguing thought provoking idea, but it was so predictable. It turned into a real snooze. The premise of the movie is not enough to carry the entire movie. Using dreams to influence behavior is a concept that has been used many times effectively. Such as SG-1 when the Harcesus teaches Daniel that power would corrupt him through a dream. But this movie has no uplifting message."
23473,False,"If you are about ten years old and like ridiculous far fetched plots this movie is for you. I read the first glowing review and I am wondering what planet the reviewer is from. The plot is a mess, the special effects are lame and the whole think stinks. Don't waste you money..it is worth $1 when it comes out on Red Box but even this assumes you are desperate for a distraction. I was thoroughly disappointed in Decaprio's acting and the story line screams a desperate attempt at trying to do something different rather than crafting a good movie. The child actress female lead...looks to be about 15 years old is totally miscast. She does not do herself justice when compared to her role and acting Juno. Finally the plot seems to have been padded to make the movie fill time. At the end they seem to have run out of budget and simply don't explain how Decaprio is saved or saves himself or something. Stupid stupid stupid."
23474,False,"Long, BORING, never-ending! In 15 minutes you do not care who and why in this or that reality...You cannot even sleep there- too noisy... TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!! Tasteless chewing-gum... Almost as disappointing as Shutter Island (that was at least shorter)... DiCaprio is protecting wild nature or not eating meat - it's OK...But to take part in those incredible boring to death movies - it's really a failure... You come to see something really extraordinary - but - again and again - kinda art-house with visual effects - AND DISGUSTINGLY LONG AND BORING!!!"
23475,False,"For the amount of effort that went into this production, I found the result to be ultimately pretty dull. Like nearly 99% of what has come out of Hollywood in the past 15 years or so, this film has loads of technique but little heart. It offers little to care for, and therefore little to remember.Yes, there's some fancy graphics, but that's about it. The internal logic of the nested dreams is routinely disrupted, the action sequences don't make much sense (why all the shooting, really?) and none of the characters are emotionally involving. Di Caprio's character has a nominal story arc at best, and the angst he's supposed to feel is not grounded because we don't know neither his nor his wife's history, or how they got together.Yes, Inception is a fun mind game. But like most mind games, it ultimately doesn't make for a worthwhile experience. And at 2.5 hours this mind game is far too overblown. Its lack of proportion (too much talk, too many levels, too much trivial action, complicated for the sake of complicated) unfortunately makes things worse. The incessant music, typical of Zimmer, is trivially repetitive, as are much of the action sequences. Ultimately these become much more intrusive and annoying as the film progressives.When I compare this film to older ones, like The Woman in the Window, which achieves so much more of a memorable experience and story, yet with so little, one has to wonder if technology and truckloads of cash are getting in the way of memorable storytelling.This film would have fared much better as a comedy, or maybe as round-table discussion about dreams, or maybe as a survey of a Facebook clique of friends sharing dreams. But the film needed to have far more fantasy to really evoke the sensation of dreamscapes. And most importantly, it needed a far more soulful and compelling story with characters we are allowed to learn about and therefore care about."
23476,False,"OK here goes. I'll prepare myself for an ass kicking.I finish watching this film thinking are you guys really watching the same film as me!!?? Does this film really deserve 9.1 out of 10??? (1st sept 2010).I found this film incredibly frustrating. So I guess at the start you learn what a cool concept the film is based on. Nice idea. Very interesting. So why take over 2hrs to get to the point!!?? I fell asleep twice whilst watching it and still managed to catch the end - not feeling that i'd missed anything important.I didn't really like the characters. In these films you tend to connect with as least ONE character but I didn't feel it here at all.So some of you like the FX?? Yeah that ONE scene they used in the trailer. The one they sold the film on.Oh yeah. The last rant....i cant stand films where they introduce rules and details that only apply in the next few scenes. It so annoying and predictable. They do that a lot in this film.So anyway. I left asking myself and the other people I saw this with why this film is so overrated and there are a lack of bad reviews about it. We concluded its one of these trendy films that are meant to be clever and intelligent. I think people will be afraid of saying bad points about this just in case it suggests that they don't understand the concept. I for one did understand it, I just didn't like it. I certainly don't think it deserves 9.1 out of 10.My suggestion....just go and rent Matrix or Minority Report or something like that. Clever, visually brilliant AND enjoyable."
23477,False,"Let me start by saying that this movie would have been good had I not seen Shutter Island or read ""I am the Cheese"". Inception is nothing more then Shutter Island meets the Matrix. The motive and the plot are the same in both Shutter Island and Inception. SPOILER DO NOT READ IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE.Both of DiCaprio's characters in these films both blame them selves for the death of their wives, they spend the movie creating a world where they do not have to live with the guilt of their loss. I know you are reading this and thinking ""But a lot of movies have wives as the root of the characters problems"" and your right so let me go further. In both movies DiCaprio also has issues with his children, in one they are dead and in the other he is unable to see them.Now if that isn't enough here is the mini cherry on top of the regular cherry on top of the Sunday of recycled garbage that is this film. In both movies he blames a single selfish action of his own doing for the reason of his wife's death. This is why he creates these worlds to live in to hide the truth from him self.On a positive note the effects of this movie were awesome. Some of the best I have seen in a long time I enjoy seeing Hollywood try something new rather then overload their films with CGI. Other than that I have nothing positive to say about this film.I end this by saying watch either Shutter Island or Inception, either film on their own was OK but when you watch one after the other all you can do is think ""Man why is Leo playing the same roll again, he has depth he is much better then this"". Also Nolan go out and find a good script and stop piggy backing off of other films."
23478,False,"The Not-Too-Revealing-Summary: Inception is a thought-provoking action movie that is best tagged with keywords like ""con-men,"" ""corporate espionage,"" ""psychological thriller"" or even ""philosophy.""The-Not-Too-Revealing-Review: Inception takes a very simple - and very traditional - genre and fashions it around a complicated idea. The movie is truly a work of art - in a positive sense as much as in a pejorative sense. Director Christopher Nolan takes a fairly complicated notion and unravels it for the audience in such a way as to entertain visually and provoke thoughtfully. The movie was, however, art for art's sake. It was a demonstration: the goal was not to amaze, thrill, or surprise but to bewilder. It was a presentation of a mental knot and then the step-by-step exhibition of how one would disentangle it. In this regard the movie was a success. Some of my many grievances (and they were many) against the film: The action scenes were quite obviously padding for the core of the film. Most of the scenes were shot in indoor, extremely confined situations - and though stylish - they were not the strikingly visual scenes I had hoped for. The big, outdoor, scenes where this big budget film had a chance to truly impress failed completely. The fight scenes where the movie had the opportunity to provide some iconic segment - looked like men hoisted in the air with wires. Between two of Nolan's other works - Memento and the Dark Knight - Inception was more Memento. The attention to detail present in the Dark Knight made it into Inception - but only into the unraveling of Nolan's idea. The many filler scenes lacked this consideration and left the film with a duality of wonderfully thought-through details interspersed with inanity.Some other odds and ends: Tip of the hat to Nolan for leaving some things unexplained. It is unclear if this is truly present day or some time in the future and the director rightly leaves that for the audience to decide for themselves. Explanations for the mechanisms of the technology are left alone - and for the better. I could not have told you who Tom Hardy was before this film but after this performance I look forward to whatever it is he may do next. I hope Nolan credits a certain 1999 film (whose title I shall not mention so I do not spoil this movie for anyone else). The relationship goes far beyond similarity or inspiration. Nolan took it further (with a budget of over $130 million more) but it is bothersome to see Inception heralded for ""originality."" Overall I cannot recommend this film. It was neither enjoyable nor entertaining to watch. I can respect the skill it takes for someone to make a house of cards but in the end I have no real desire to stare at a house of cards."
23479,False,"NOTE: Nolan fanboys are going to hate my review, don't even bother to send me PM's saying ""U SUCK, YOUR TASTE SUX"". Don't even bother to report this review hoping that someone will delete it, it will prove that fanboys are a bunch of keyboard warriors trying to ""deffend"" everything in the most ridiculous way.Everyone is saying that this is the best movie of the year and saying that ""it looks like an Alfred Hitchcok movie""....it doesn't even come close from the masterpieces of Hitchcok ! Everyone gave this movie a 10 star rating even if they didn't saw it, because it was from the director of The Dark Knight (another disappointment, but less painful than this piece of crap), the audience are a bunch of sheeps.The story is predictable, the twists are predictable, the action scenes sucks, they sucked so much that i almost missed the ""action"" sequence of the Transformers movies (the live action ones).Why i give this movie a 2 stars ? one star for the cast and another one for the musical score.UPDATE: i had the misfortune to rewatch this piece of crap and my vote is 1, truly awful."
23480,False,"There is no way ""Inception"" will be a bad movie because it was directed by Christopher Nolan. There are many words to describe this movie and those are: mind-bending, imaginative, exciting, overwhelming, entertaining, and awesome. ""Inception"" might be the only movie this summer that has an original concept.""Inception"" is very unique and it is fresh to everybody. The visuals were overwhelming. The action scenes are awesome. The CGI effects were realistic and eye candy. The story is interesting and mind-bending.The performances were great. Leonardo DiCaprio is still a great actor. Tom Hardy and Ken Watanabe are one of the best parts of the movie. Cillian Murphy is disappointing though. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance is flawless.""Inception"" is mind-bending and non-stop entertaining. Once again Christopher Nolan made another successful blockbuster. ""Inception"" might be the best movie of the year."
23481,False,"This film should have been awarded a Razzie for having the worst plot, that is if such an award exists. The plot was immensely difficult to follow. I remember reading one of a free cinema magazines while watching it at the cinema. The plot is in a dream, that is in another dream that is in a dream while he is dreaming, or something along those lines. For the first half an hour or so I was engaged with the film's plot. Who wouldn't be interested in the idea that Nolan was playing with? But he took his ideas too far in the case of 'Inception.' The whole thing just became ridiculous. The bizarre plot had an effect on the other aspects of the film. The otherwise brilliant action scenes became surprisingly dull. As I often had little idea of what was going on, to me the action scenes just seemed pointless as I did not know what the characters motives were.Despite this, the action scenes and the cinematography did offer a real spectacle.Again, one of the positives was that the acting was, admittedly of a good quality. DiCaprio, Page, Caine and Postlewaite all had good performances. But is was such a shame that I was not able to follow the development of the characters because of the plot.Overall, if you enjoy a mind-boggling plot then 'Inception' will be for you. If you want a film that you will enjoy from start to finish without having to get into it, 'Inception' will not be for you."
23482,False,"I just can't believe this movie made it to number 13 on the IMDb top 250! I've watched it twice. I didn't get the whole concept and the plot in general. Yes, the special effects are what you would expect from a movie of this caliber. The acting isn't superb. I have never liked Leonardo Dicaprio, he didn't impress me in this movie as well. No matter how old he is to me he always have that teenage look that doesn't convince me especially in serious movies like this one.The movie takes us in way too many ""dreams"" that at one point you wonder what's the reality, are the characters in a dream, or they are in present?! For the most part i was forcing my brain to figure out what's going on instead of enjoying the entertaining parts of the film. I would only give this movie 2 stars for the modernistic, high-end special effects. Definitely doesn't deserve a top spot. Not on my list!"
23483,False,"""Inception"" seems to be taking the premises of such films as ""Peter Ibbetson,"" ""Altered States,"" ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" to more elaborate lengths. Throughout this action flick  and that is what it truly is, despite its pretenses  I couldn't help thinking of the most recent James Bond thriller in which I lost track of who was who among the secondary characters because the identities they started with were revealed as false, but then the revelation itself was proved equally false (or at least dubious), to the point where you couldn't believe a word they were saying and ultimately you ceased to care. With ""Inception"" we get a lot of technical jabbering from the mouths of Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page about what everything means or might mean as they ""share"" and ""engineer"" other people's dreams in order to infiltrate their subconscious to achieve their corporate goals. These dream states are filled with the usual action staples of racing and crashing vehicles, explosions and the liberal use of automatic weapons, accompanied here by huge crumbling cityscapes (less effective than the more modest melting away of various smaller environments in ""Eternal Sunshine""). There is nothing particularly dreamy about writer-director Christopher Nolan's dream world; aside from a few interesting computer-generated images like a whole city appearing to fold over upon itself, none of the effects stick in the mind or affect the viewer's juices. Marion Cotillard contributes her trademark broken heartedness. Page gives the same performance we are familiar with from her telesystems commercials. Cillian Murphy emotes richly as the kidnapped son of an energy industry magnate. The heaving score by Hans Zimmer sounds like hundreds of others."
23484,False,"If you like action movies and are short of gray matter, you'll love this one. But if you have a brain, or even half of one, you'll want your money back.This dreadful piece of trash is the biggest wast of money, both mine and the producers', that I believe I've ever seen. Intellectually incoherent, VERY bad acting, mediocre special effects. needlessly convoluted plot and worst of all, completely pointless. All the actors are talented (except Marion Cotillard, who couldn't act her way out of a paper bag, in English anyway), but they were all just phoning it in.All the positive reviews, of which there areunfortunatelymany, never mention how great the ""Story""or ""plot"" is. The mental midgets who like it rave and rave and rave about the special effects. Well, my dear thinking, tasteful friends, that should tell you something. Do not go see this movie unless you are escaping open-air radiation."
23485,False,"This movie starts off really interesting, but fails to go any deeper than lots of standard Hollywood crap like a really forced back story for the main character. Characters lack depth, and the most interesting part of the movie is its visual effects, which are nowhere short of amazing, Avatar level production. However, in a few couple of years, these CGI effects will not be that impressive anymore, and then people will (hopefully) see how lacking this movie is for a good story and characters. The average moviegoer will love this movie, but if you like good movies in the sci-fi genre, you kind of expect at least some plot twists. Still, the movie is good, and well made, but not great, It will most probably be forgotten in a couple of yearsIf you enjoy movies with action and CGI and want a movie to watch with friends, go see this movie. If you are looking for something truly original(storywise), then avoid this movie at all costs"
23486,False,"Rex Reed's review, which can be viewed on Rotten Tomatoes, says it all. I don't always agree with Rex, but the man is a movie critic of long-standing repute, and he's secure enough to call worthless dreck what it is. I read the blurbs of many other professional movie critics, and in one sentence, you can tell they're disingenuous, people writing what they've been told or paid to write. Spinners. Posers.Inception rating > 9 on IMDb is what Michael Moore was referring to when he said at the Oscars several years ago (he was referring to our national politics, foreign policy and political leadership at the time, but it applies to the mainstream media and all mass-marketing as well): We live in fictitious times."
23487,False,"At what point does a film become too complicated for its own good? In the case of Inception, almost immediately: in a bid to make the ultimate 'mind-f**k' movie, writer/director Christopher Nolan starts his film at 'bloody confusing' and, over the course of 148 excruciatingly drawn-out minutes, works his way up to 'completely and utterly unfathomable' before leaving the film on a predictably ambiguous note (thus allowing endless discussion on movie forums).Along the way, Nolan introduces many an intriguing idea, but the ones that haven't been nicked from far better movies (eXistenZ, Vanilla Sky, The Matrix, Dark City, Cypher) are so half-baked that the film inevitably becomes a frustrating mess of contradiction and contrivance which conjures up an endless stream of questions (see IMDb's FAQs), none of which seem to have any satisfying answers (despite the best efforts of Nolan's rabid fan-boys).Lost in Inception's labyrinthine plot, all I could do was sit back and marvel at the special effectswhich are undeniably impressivewhilst asking myself repeatedly how Ariadne (Ellen Page) became such a great architect despite no actual work experience, and whether such a pretty young woman would really be happy to be sedated in a grubby warehouse by a group of suspicious looking strangers. Somehow, I doubt it.5 out of 10 for its jaw-dropping effects (in particular, the awesome gravity-defying fight scene), and I reckon that's being generous."
23488,False,"I am not the first to claim this, I read that on a Prestige or Batman Begins board. But now I am in complete agreement with the one who said it. Inception can arguably be Nolan's best work yet, improving upon the juggernaut which was The Dark Knight. But before I comment on Inception, I want to review Nolan's work first, shedding light on the true genius he is. It all started with a short called Doodlebug. I won't spoil anything, because the film is about three minutes long, but Nolan starts one of his trademarks: the twist. I don't have a link but I know it is online and a few searches should yield a result of the short. If you like Nolan and his work, check it out. The next was Following, an ultra low budget film (around $6000), about a young man who follows people just to see what they do and where they are going. He also meets a character named Cobb... interesting name. It features Nolan's next genius trademark--the use of non-linear storytelling. Overall a nice low budget film worth spending an hour and ten minutes on. I recommend it. Now on to the complete mind f**k that was Memento. It is this film that Nolan perfects his non-linear storytelling. Shown in almost complete reverse, Memento follows a man named Leonard with a rare condition in which he cannot form new memories. We learn early on he only lives for revenge. HIGHLY recommend if you have not seen it yet. It really sets the standard for non-linear storytelling. Insomnia was Nolan's third full length film, and yet manages to add something else: an all-star cast. It features Academy Award winners Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, and finally, one of the best actors of his generation (maybe ever), Al Pacino. Pacino plays Detective Will Dormer sent to Alaska to investigate a murder. Again, plot twists and non-linear structure are used in this film. It is my least favorite of Nolan's films, but that doesn't take away anything from it. It is still very good.Now to the film that put Nolan on the map: Batman Begins. The Batman franchise was all but dead in the water until Nolan got his hands on it. Now it sets the standards for super-hero movies. Non-linear storytelling, a great cast, and plot twists are all perfectly placed in this. I personally view it as the second best super-hero movie ever made, and is, in my opinion, a great movie altogether. To break up the Batman films, Nolan did a little movie called The Prestige. Telling the story of two magicians, they are first friends, then become rivals, then end up as enemies. Starring Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine, another all-star cast is present. The non-linear structure in this movie is genius, so be prepared to think a little bit. Overall a great film and one of my favorites. Now for the one everyone knows. I cannot say enough about The Dark Knight. One thing I can say is it was the first movie to exceed my expectations when they were that high. Heath Ledger's joker is my favorite character ever portrayed on screen, and will be for some time. His Academy Award is well deserved. His passing is such a shame. And although The Dark Knight did not get the Best Picture nomination, or win, it certainly had effects on the Academy. By public outrage, the 2009 Academy Awards featured ten Best Picture Nominations instead of the usual five. Without The Dark Knight, movies like Inglourious Basterds, District 9, and yes, Avatar would have never come close to being nominated. It was definitely the best film of 2008, the best superhero movie ever made, and my favorite movie ever. Until about forty-five minutes ago. That's when Inception ended and I sat staring at the credits to what I had just witnessed. I am still thinking about how the movie ended and it's safe to say I will be watching it at least two more times on the big screen. It surpasses The Dark Knight in terms of how big it is by a long shot. The acting was stellar by everyone, especially Leonardo DiCaprio. It's a bit early, but I think a Best Actor Nomination should be in order. Also another trademark of Nolan, the casting of Michael Caine. It's the fourth consecutive film to feature him. Now on to the best aspect of this film, the storytelling. Again, the non-linear structure is used, and is as perfect as it gets. Every shot has meaning. All the dialog by the characters is relevant. Some may complain it is lengthy, but if anything was cut, things would start to be confusing. I could write page after page about how good the story was, but you have to see it to truly experience it. The tag line 'Your mind is the scene of the crime' is all you should really know going into this movie. I personally avoided (painfully, i might add) every trailer, synopsis, and review i could of Inception before I saw it.This movie is not for everyone however. It is not a late night, brainless action movie like Crank or 2012. It requires the audience to have smart brain-think. So on a scale of 1-10, Inception is about a 12. This, without question, the best movie of the year. If The Academy snubs Nolan out of this Oscar, I think I might kill someone. He should have the Best Director award in the bag. However, to truly enjoy it, you have to pay attention. It's complex, but never confusing. If you enjoy a great thriller that is anything but straightforward, this is the movie for you. And be prepared to use your mind. =] And that's all I got. 10/10"
23489,False,"As an American Indian i was raised, unlike modern people, with a deep ceremonial experience with dreaming. Every idea in modern society seems to diminish the natural ability of people to dream and to remember what they dream. A film like this exploits the natural interest people have in dreams to tell an impossible story. As entertainment it is passable, even interesting...as information on dreaming it is not only worthless, it takes the mind away from any hope of effective dreaming. This is the toxic nature of the film-making experience, where we see reality in such a skewed and unreliable way that we no longer understand reality. Human society has surrendered its powers to dream to the church, to the university, to the corporate paymaster and so modern life is for most people dreamless. Given an opportunity to bring some great idea about dreaming to the screen, the filmmakers instead make a fantasy that is complicated, over-acted and so unrealistic I am just amazed that so many dreamless people have given it such a high rating. Dreaming takes place inside the human spirit, real dreaming takes place among groups of people. But people no longer know this. Dreaming evolved in the human mind from the many thousands of generations people spent living and sleeping together...which they no longer do. As an experienced dreamer I think this film is useless. As one who likes a good film, I think it is useless. Modern people just don't get it, and this sadness is the major component in the new world order."
23490,False,"I'll try to make this as short and painless as possible.Lately there have been a run of films exploring the nature of reality. But compared to THE MATRIX series, or say DARK CITY, this film can't hold a mental candle. Maybe it's because of the Christopher Nolan-DiCaprio combo, maybe because of a few very cool visual effects (like a city turned sideways or upside-down), but for the life of me I can' understand why this film is rated a 9 on IMDb. I guess this is what happens when everyone gets to rate, and ""everyone"" means...well, average film knowledge...and prejudice. Where is the OBJECTIVITY, people? The problems, you ask, as if you don't want to take my word for it? Well it put my son to sleep and darned near got me, for one. It's too long and moves too slowly, then suddenly heaps plot setups and twists on you in desperate attempt to try and make the convoluted thing make sense. Where I come from we call this bad timing. And in a film LIKE this, well, that's not a good thing. The script is terrible. Even Leonardo's acting is not up to his usual par, the little girl cast as the architect was too wrong, and on the whole this film is just not believable. That some actually say this is Leonardo's best work is troubling to me on so many levels.Just because you make a bus fall off a bridge in slow motion shouldn't give you Oscar mentionings, you would think.Terrible waste of millions, I gotta say, I being an admirer of both the genre and Leonardo. But, again, don't take my word for it; watch it for free somehow (don't spend hard-earned money on this dog, for sure), then let me know where I have gone wrong. I give it a 5 only because of the effects I mentioned (not unique in film, but well-done) and the A-1 supporting performance by Joe Levitt. HE did what he could, after all."
23491,False,"I cannot believe people have voted this movie 9.0. I never critique a movie just because it does not make sense, I love quite a few extremely stupid b-movies which are far from making any sense. In my opinion, a movie can make no sense all right, provided it is still entertaining. However, this one does happen to make so little sense that it should be classified as fantasy, not sci-fi, as explained in detail in many ""Hated It"" comments here. And as for entertainment, Inception, a movie about dreams, ironically made me so sleepy I barely made it to the end.Basically most ""Loved It"" comments here posit this movie to be pure ""genius"" because it is so ""complex"" and ""multi-layered"". If you don't like it, you must be too stupid to understand all the supposedly mesmerizing, breathtaking and complex ""layers"" or ""levels"". In short, an idea that one can dream within a dream either ""blows your mind"" or you are stupid. Well, okay, maybe it's just me. I happen to have been reading sci-fi since my early childhood, plus virtually all the software code I write actually represent a complex and multi-layered virtual reality, so I'm personally not that impressed. Looks like the ""Loved It"" guys were truly ""mesmerized"" by the dream-within-a-dream idea though, must have been quite an intellectual shock for them. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with it, only that it's not necessarily a ""genius"" in 2010. I would probably be ""mesmerized"" if I watched Nolan's movie in, say, 1910 (or to be on the safe side, in 1810).The worst was the casting, Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Page are good actors, but their cute & cuddly faces in a supposedly dark and moody sci-fi movie? No credibility at all, that completely threw me off. That choice would be perfect if Nolan was at least shooting for so-bad-it's-good movie. As a result, Inception is so-average-it-makes-you-sleepy movie."
23492,False,"INCEPTION The dialogue in this film is preoccupied with explaining what is happening, rather than being natural. This is very possibly due to the director feeling the concept of the film was too complicated for mere cinema goers to comprehend and instead of enhancing the film as a good flowing natural dialogue might it in fact has a tendency to spoil the film. It is also very repetitive, continually repeating the rules of inception, the inner workings of the dream construction. It becomes very annoying and I'm sure Inception holds the world record for saying the word 'dream' more times than any other.There is a concept in teaching, developed by the Americans which goes like this, tell the people what you are going to teach them, then teach it to them, then tell them what is was you just taught them. It seems the director has adopted this method of explaining to the audience, just in case they are too stupid to get it for themselves, what the film is about and what is happening.Di Caprio who in my opinion is a talented actor that often picks challenging roles was neither commanding nor outstanding. Partly due to the lack of any real structure to the film as the whole thing seemed too fluid and poured out in a tsunami of CGI. Additionally there is no kind of character development, something Di Caprio is generally masterful at, leaving the film feeling hollow and a waste of an otherwise talented cast. Something Hollywood studios will often do when trying to portray highly intelligent criminals (or evil masterminds) is cast British actors, and it is noticeable in Inception that director Christopher Nolan has not broken away from the stereotype.A previous reviewer wrote ""The stupid dialog is there, because Nolan did not know, how to push the plot forward in an integrated way"" and i totally agree.I've heard a lot about how Inception is the new Matrix and I must confess I have never watched Matrix, I did sit down and try, on three occasions to do so, but all three times i fell asleep out of sheer boredom. That is not sarcasm it is real. I know the Matrix story as it's so well known, whether or not Inception is the new Matrix i cannot say but I can confess it's a fairly redundant mediocre film with an over contrived plot strung together by cliché action scenes. The plot concept is not so difficult to comprehend and seems to be hyped up for what it really is. The only real thought needed is that of the closing shot, (this is not a spoiler ).. does it tip or does it keep spinning? I smell a sequel.3/10"
23493,False,"~MY REVIEW CONTAINS SEVERAL REFERENCES TO TARKOVSKY, A QUOTATION FROM ROGER EBERT AND ANOTHER FROM CHRISTOPHER NOLAN'S INCEPTION SCRIPT (for detailed info check below the end of this article)~ Ideas need to be enriched while the roots are kept loyal, especially in Sci-Fi. Above everything else, aware of the fact that while the story is taking place in several dimensions of dreams, there is no link to the real-life. My first point is about this huge story development deficiency. The only link to our universal earth dimension is Michael Caine character and the children, and they're frozen, they're playing out there in the garden, we see from behind. This is the first thing why the whole movie is para-psychologically inappropriate. I said para-psychologically inappropriate, 'cos today psychology is in the point that dreams expose supernatural(or meta-physical) skills of human mind. If you are implanting an idea through a dream into someone's mind, it's not that easy, THE BALANCE OF NATURE WOULDN'T EASILY LET YOU DO THAT. As an example I want to compare the Inception with ""The Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind"". There, Jim Carrey was going back time in his dream trying to identify the person who is dating with his fiancée; but he ends up with facing a supernatural vitality covering the person's face. The way Nolan explains is this: *(1)* ""Never recreate places from your memory. Always imagine new places."" When the time comes where Saito explains why he hired Cobb for the implantation, this is all we get: *(2)* ""You remind me of someone... a man I met in a half-remembered dream. He was possessed of some radical notions"" So the most important question one ever needs to ask ""How did they all start to dream implantation?"". There is no answer nor explanation to it. Whereas in its ancestor, ""The Minority Report"" was quite brilliant at explaining the technological advance. Compare with Matrix, the dreams are your guides to the reality, you're not a guide to someone's dream. Matrix gives you a clue of understanding how some people's lives may change with their dreams and visions. It had this inspiration that Neo became a hero out of a loser. Dreams are able to do that, as Wachowski Brothers taught us. Another comparison can be done with the good and evil side. Nolan never divides people into good vs. evil as Batman or as Memento or any films he's done. But for someone's favor, Cobb is hired by business man to implant an idea into another business man, which doesn't do any thing with the good. *(3)* ""The only condition of fighting for the right to create is faith in your own vocation, readiness to serve, and refusal to compromise"" Sci-Fi loves impossible, but it also denies the practical errors. Inception's plot is theoretically fine but practically slow off the mark. Just like Roger Ebert said at Chicago Sun, Inception's story can either be told in a few sentences or not told at all. Ebert's approach to criticize Nolan's earlier work was even more harsh. *(4)* ""How does a man with short-term memory loss, remember he has short-term memory loss?"" (for Memento). Some injuries can go engraved someone's sub-conscious, so he didn't even need to remember it, he was just living it. Though Ebert was right on one thing, that if Ellen Page hasn't been enrolled in the movie as a new chosen one to this confidential job, the whole movie was almost meaning nonsense. The things that are likable is Marion Cotillard participating as a independent virus in dreams, going in and killing whoever and whenever she likes. Ellen Page is being used to create spaces in dreams, so that the missionaries will be able to create totems that tell a person whether they're dreaming or living the reality. The only totem without Ellen Page was the spinning of the whipping top in the sleep house. Also the last dream which Di Caprio is having on the airplane was cut in the half as if it was meant for to be continued. It was the only dream that made me believe that someone is dreaming, whether it's Cobb or Arthur or any of the missionaries. 'CAUSE DREAMS NEVER LAST. *(1)*(2)*: from Quotes for Inception at IMDb / *(3)* : from Andrei Tarkovsky quotes at thinkexist.com / *(4)* : from Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times, July.14.2010"
23494,False,"i really do not understand that how people say it is a masterpiece it is a piece of faeces... plagiarism from matrix.. the high rates are just about some fans of mr Leonardo dicaprio? yes of course the wet girls who like him vote 10 always..they don't watch the film, they watch their potential dream boy..the film is really very boring and i couldn't wait until it finished and i think the points will be in a decreasing line in future..worthless film waste of time..and it is an insult to the films really deserve high points..the perception of reality is the same in matrix and this must be discussed by the people who watched this film.this is about money and advertisement of such Hollywood films they have the ability to show a bad film as a good one.."
23495,False,"I was trying my best to keep from falling asleep. What purports to be a breakthrough film about dreams, turned out to be a first-rate, high-budget snooze fest. The writer couldn't decide, I suppose, whether he wanted to do a James Bond movie or the Matrix or the Thirteen Floor. Leo Dicapprio's character is insipid. Ellen Page's character is two sentences short of a paragraph. Everyone else was unmemorable. I couldn't care less if anyone lived or died. Nothing really made much sense. And don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved the Thirteenth Floor and the Matrix (though the sequels were blech!). Christopher Nolan did a great job with Memento and Batman Begins and the Dark Knight, but OMG, what was everyone thinking? Apparently, I, too, am in a nightmare, looking at the great reviews. And while the special effects were eye-catching, they were not mind boggling. Two clenched fists for this one. Methinks now, I'll just go and watch Green Lantern and do myself in."
23496,False,"I went into this movie expecting something profound in every aspect that a movie can potentially portray; this was due to the fact that I trusted the intellectual integrity of the people who had told me that it was one of the best movies that they had ever seen. During the movie, I was falling asleep in the beginning (where the plot is really being described), but still was able to understand the movie fully. The people rating this movie with 10 stars are so infatuated with the fact that they had to think in order to understand the movie fully, they're looking past 2 things; a) they probably need to think to do a lot of things if understanding this movie required an immense amount of thought, b) this actually just isn't the one of the best movies ever created. The plot had loop holes and parts that didn't make sense, and sometimes the ""rules"" (per say) of the dream world weren't really put into use, and often broken.The reason I'm giving this movie 6 stars is because it is still nevertheless a good movie, but intelligent? No. Should it be the #3 highest rated movie on IMDb? No. Should the stupid people who think they're smart stop clogging the reviews and allow people who could think straight throughout the entire movie to review it? Absolutely, and this movie being considered as one of the best movies of all time is a premature bi-product of the latter. Final Note: Good movie, unbelievable visuals, completely unworthy."
23497,False,"This movie has several dazzling special effects. But other than that, what is there to say. Well, mainly....YAWN. Many comedy movies are just sketches strung together with the barest of threads to hold the plot together. Inception does the same thing for action movies, the action sequences are held together with a plot that pretends to be complicated, but in reality is wafer thin and yet full of holes that you could put Incepton's entire budget for special effects into each one of them. Inceptions virtual world does not impress because it is a work of beauty without any connection with dreams at all. Take away the special effects and you are left with substandard, uninspired acting and a boring movie."
23498,False,"Visually stunning but with a little bit on the inside this movie will give you exactly the same experience as The Shutter Island - previous DiCaprio's work. Tom Hardy & Cillian Murphy are the only actors who actually fit the movie. The rest of quite amazing line-up is all over the place and doesn't really suit their roles. Movie seems to focus on DiCaprio without even trying to give away any information about other characters. Now to the art work: the dreams that were created suppose to be convincing to the subject but they didn't even look that real on the screen. Artificial acting with backgrounds looks really plastic and gives away the ending right in middle of the movie. I would consider 2 hour 30 minutes is a big fail from editors and director for the amount you get from the flick. Christopher Nolan spent almost 10 years writing the screen play, but originality that he had in Memento is well overpowered by Hollywood glitter with no substance that new Batman movies are so full of. Overall, watch it if you like eye-candy movies. I bet there would be plenty fans and a lot of talk but movie just doesn't cut it for me when you know what is going to happen and there is more than an hour to go until the end."
23499,False,"I have given this one star because the high rating this movie had is out of all proportion. There are myriads of far better films with lower scores. Let's get this score down.I have the impression that this movie started with a script which had a couple of scenes in the middle, and it was then written further to extend it to a beginning and an end. The mystery is why anyone bothered to try to have a coherent script in the first place. Plot? we don't need no stinkin plot. The basic idea of such movies is to show stunning visual and auditory effects, have characters hurtling along, mouthing dialog not meant to be coherent or even perceptible. Show em the technology, wind the characters up and get them moving-fast! Have Whoosh, whoosh, bam, bang sound effects and music to match, get a name star, and advertise the predictable and unchallenging goop as a transcendental experience.This one was interesting in places because of the visual tricks. Otherwise, I had trouble following it at times, as much because I couldn't care less about what was a dream or reality, whose dream we were in, or why this or that was happening. Explanations of the arbitrary dream rules (excuses to do various things) were the most transparent gobble-de-gook imaginable.Nothing in here had a dream like quality. The dream excuse was a gimmick to do things like play with gravity, time, etc.It is just another mindless action movie, just longer and with fancy justification. As such it is not bad-but not good."
23500,False,"I think you are all DREAMING. I tried to watch this film FIVE, YES FIVE times and just didn't get it. Too convoluted, no character development, bizarre jumping from one scene to the next without a common thread or context. I have an exceptionally high IQ, and frankly, felt I was watching ""special effects gone wild"". Please, bring back the art of true film making with great scripts, outstanding acting, real characters and a plausible storyline.I felt this film was pointless, without direction and a total waste of talent! Nolan did an excellent job with The Dark Knight; this film is a disaster."
23501,False,"The essential problem with this movie is that it has no logic rules to abide by. And, mind you, even dreams have rules, as Freud started to hint. A rule is not ""I do what pleases me"", which is what we see throughout this movie. That's arbitrariness. Mr. Nolan should learn from hard working writers to build seriously an imaginary universe, like Tolkien, Borges, Frank Herbert, etc. Worlds with RULES. Because without rules, the writer can do whatever pleases him any moment. And as anything is possible,... who cares? And as one stops caring, one starts to get booooooored. Specially if in a supposedly imaginative story you get punished endlessly with the oh-so-hackneyed pursuits and shoot-out of faceless bad guys... Yah, yeah, yeah, original, new and unseen as an Edwin S. Porter film. Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawnie!"
23502,False,"Ten years ago, Christopher Nolan wrote and directed the brilliant 'Momento', a stunning thriller that pushed the boundaries of storytelling convention. It was great, but still, one couldn't help wondering, where would Nolan go from here? How could he trump this achievement? In fact, although his subsequent films have been praised, they've been less distinctive, but with 'Inception', he returns to his adventurous roots, producing a story that is even more audacious than 'Momento'; and unfortunately, the result is dreadful. And worse than the fact that it doesn't really work is the fact that while it is distinctive, it is distinctive in a very conventional way. Since his early success, Nolan has taken work from big studios, and 'Inception' is no exception; and the result is a Hollywood movie straining desperately to stand out, instead of something more truly independent. in spirit.To make the point in more detail, 'Inception' features a starry cast (I'm, afraid for me, the casting of Leonardo diCaprio has become a clear sign of a poor film with pretensions); an implausibly attractive geeky female assistant; loads of expository dialogue (at one point, it is explained that someone is the most powerful media baron in the world  i.e. they appear to be so powerful that no-one had heard of them); fast pace and Jason Bourne style camera work; sub-'Matrix' style ideas about the nature of reality, superficially intriguing and certainly confusing, but of little philosophical depth; extraordinary special effects; and above all else, a plot comprising an incoherent sequence of random set-piece scenes that seems constructed to showcase said special effects rather than because it makes sense as a story. It may sound like an intriguing idea to have the cast simultaneously fighting for their lives in seven different nested dream-spaces, but in fact, it isn't; multiplying the threat to the heroes only reduces the dramatic impact of each one.To give Nolan credit, he has made a wholly cinematic film; you certainly couldn't imagine this in book form. Sadly it's very hard to imagine it as a screenplay either, or as any sort of story. And it was story, not special effects, that made 'Momento' great; and while that story was highly unusual, it made internal sense. But less is never more in Hollywood; and sadly, more is often just a mess."
23503,False,"Read the films ranked below Inception in the top 250...and weep. Have people lost their critical faculties? Yes, Inception is clever, multi-layered, complex and intellectually challenging. It is also heartless. It struggles to stimulate emotion. Cleverness replaces impact. Di Caprio's one-dimensional acting reinforces this sterility. From the first shot of a grim face we get the whole range of grim faces in a grim performance. He is grim about his kids, grim about the folding graphics, grim about his team, grim about the task in hand. Of the Matrix- plus effect I did like the folding city, but the ending was portentous to the point of tedium. One very good litmus test of the quality of a film is to analyse how many times the main protagonists have to explain the plot and at what length they have to explain it. Several characters explain the rules of the dream within a dream within a dream construct at the heart of the movie, with increasing loquaciousness and qualifications. This isn't plotting and it fails to create a genuine narrative drive. Compare it to so many of the films that come below this one in the rankings, Twelve Angry Men, Seven Samurai, Goodfellas, Casablanca, Once upon a time in America, Citizen Kane for goodness' sake. Don't even mention films like Shawshank and the Godfather which rank above it. This is a good film, possibly one of the better films of the year. It is a very long way from a great one."
23504,False,"The movie is about manipulation of dreams and how it can impact a person's psyche. Caprio, in this movie is a kind of dream terrorist, who as a profession extracts information from people's mind. This is espionage of new times and he has become notoriously popular for this. However, for the last time when he undertakes a job of planting an idea into the mind of an heir to a giant business empire (Cillian Murphy ); things go wrong. I am disappointed by the script. The movie is conceptually flawed. First of all, how can you dream inside a dream, I mean how one transitions into next level of 'sleepiness'. Even if one could, why the machine used to coordinate the dreams also appears the same in the dream and works also. Why one would age in a dream; I thought in a dream the appearance of oneself is the mental projection of the memory of oneself. Same genre has been portrayed by ""Paprika"" beautifully and is much more consistent and meaningful than this version of a dream-control fantasy.First act was a bit interesting, but the plot goes haywire towards the end; lost in an attempt to incorporate useless actions scenes. Ending was as terrible as one would expect after watching the trifling second act. Trying to give an inconclusive end was a bit pathetic after what has been done to original 'idea'. There was no 'original inspiration' in this movie. By the end of it, I was in level 5.Certainly a bad one from Nolan. This not nearly as good as ""Following"" or ""Prestige"". No surreal element; twisting the city was a fleeting attempt though.Watchable once and that too would be worthwhile only on a big screen."
23505,False,"I went into this movie expecting one of the best movies of all time. However, that is not what I saw. The runtime is extremely long and I found myself checking the time several times throughout the film. It was an interesting film to see, but it definitely does not belong on a list with the likes of ""Shawshank"" or ""Godfather"". The story was very confusing.There seemed to be plot holes and loose story lines that were never really tied up. The concept of the film is very intriguing and you will leave the theater wondering what it was all about. However, the atmosphere of some of the scenes felt very similar to Shutter Island for me. I almost felt like Leonardo DiCaprio did not really have to act much as he was basically playing a character similar to that of Teddy Daniels. Hope he isn't going to spend the rest of his career playing that same character. It was also nice to see Ellen Page in something besides Juno. She can be more than a snarky, pregnant teenager. Also, The visual effects are extremely well-done.I am not a fan of Nolan's work. The Dark Knight was a film that I could never understand why there was so much hype. It was average to me, at best. Inception, however, is much better than Memento.It is a film that you must see just because the concept is very interesting, but it is not something that you can watch over and over again."
23506,False,"Visually the cinematography was excellent. The story was weak and I am shocked how many people are giving this 10 stars. 8 people I worked with saw this and only 1 liked it. This is two weird movies in a row made by Leonardo DiCaprio.I feel like Nolan is just revamping parts of Memento, Batman, Dark Knight etc to his movies. The ending credits are the same for every movie. He put in a fortress in the snow like the fortress in the beginning of Batman Returns. And what about that snow? It's like he just wanted to say let's film in the snow! He is actually stealing a lot of this from other movies and getting the credit for this being an original movie. This movie is Ocean's Eleven meets The Island. I was very disappointed."
23507,False,"I rarely post but felt the need after seeing the rave reviews on this film that I clearly disagree with. I felt obligated to vote to bring this score down to reality. I've read the terms benchmark, intelligent, masterpiece and greatest ever. After seeing the movie I find those terms and the current rating of 9.2 insulting. Yes for some reason I feel personally insulted by this. Is this because I was expecting the world after the great reviews and was truly disappointed? Was it the fact that I believe most feel the movie wasn't that great but are jumping on the bandwagon? I'm not the most intelligent individual in the world and can't understand how anyone intelligent could actually enjoy the story line with so many obvious holes. All I know is these layers upon layers of poor plots left a sour feeling in my mouth. I've read the comment and agree this is 'a smart movie for ignorant people'. They do say ignorance is bliss. Keep rating this ten you smart folk.Overrated, unengaging and far too long (let me scream that from the roof tops) are my thoughts. I paid top dollar to view this in my lovely electric reclining leather chair being waited on hand a foot in a 'gold class' cinema and I wanted to escape the comfort of my chair after 30 minutes. Long and painful movie experience. I urge you to filter through the positive reviews and read some well articulated negative responses. I have chose to keep this post short and sweet and leave the well articulated responses to the well articulated (lord knows every second person here thinks they are a literary genius). I really did want to post a 1 out of 10. I am a realist though and I have seen worse films. On a positive note Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were great. They boosted my score from a one to a three. Leo and Joseph finally went through went through puberty and were believable as adults. Give me back the 148 minutes of my life wasted watching this film."
23508,False,"Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved.Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossibleinception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming Inception 10/10"
23509,False,"The film is 2.5 hours long, yet feels like 5.2, and there are a few reasons for this. One of which is the fact that a preponderance of the first act is amateurish, conflict-free exposition, which does not bode well for repeat viewings. It's an empty shell of a film. There is no tension; you couldn't care less about any of the characters, why were they even motivated to do what they did. Helping a corporation get ""one over"" on another corporation is hardly saving the human race. The only thing I got from watching this horrible overrated bloated cinematic experiment was a wish to kill myself. Maybe I'm dreaming, too?"
23510,False,"I had the honor of seeing a pre-screening of this film tonight in Dallas. Now, I have seen lots of movies in my time, but this movie is by far...excellent. I am simply amazed at Christopher Nolan for blessing us with this film...i truly am.The trailers can only give you so much and I'm so glad they don't go too much in depth with the plot. You are literally drawn into the movie.Acting=10, Cinematography=10, Story/Plot=10, Mind Stimulation=10+ I cannot wait to read more reviews on this film. It was well worth 2+ hours and I am positive that I will be seeing it AGAIN later this week when it opens in theaters.GO SEE IT."
23511,False,"I only arrived at the 35 minutes mark on this one and I had to turn it off. I never do this, commenting on a movie I haven't seen in its entirety, but I will make an exception in this case because it reeked of pretentious and ""interesting"" from the very start. Christopher Nolan must be so full of it by now, with the success of the Batman series, that he thinks he can discard some platitude on to the screen, by relying on big stars and some teenage fantasy...and by the way, other than Watanabe,Caine and Berenger, what's with all the teenage looking actors (I have to admit, good ones)? For a second there, I thought they are turning Beverly Hills 90210 into a movie. I admire Leonardo di Caprio as an actor, but if I ever see him in an action man-hero sequence again, I'll call Kate Winslet to squash him like a bug (in Titanic, she looked huge compared to him),he's just not believable in those roles (and I thought Charlie Sheen looked ridiculous in the 80' s and '90's) no matter how much he tries, sometimes it works sufficiently, sometimes it doesn't but the fact that he seems to look for those roles all the time, and what a shame, compared to his earlier roles.I'll just stop here, I've rarely received such a bad vibe from a movie. The incredible special effects (which i acknowledge with 1 point) only made it worse, since they were supporting crap."
23512,False,"I just can't believe that this movie gets a 9!!! It's pretentious, boring and 'much ado about nothing'. I thought it would be a movie as good as 'The Matrix' (the first one!), but that movie is so much better. If you like movies with a twist, try 'Blade runner', 'Moon', 'Minority report' or even 'Triangle', but skip this one. What a waste of time and talent. With that money you could make 20 or so great, personal movies. Or feed a small African country... Watching this failure really made me angry. It's an empty shell. O.k., there are some pluses: the actors do their best and some scenes look great, especially the crumbling cliffs and the 'ceiling' of buildings, but that's just not enough for a movie that lasts for 2 1/2 hours..."
23513,False,"I got the opportunity to see this movie a week in advance :). Let me just say it is no disappointment in every witch way! As most of Leonardo's movies are good this one is even better! it will blow your mind, so yes i recommend everyone should see it even if you like Leo's work you will still enjoy this movie. Moments in the film keep you at the edge of your seat waiting to find out what happens next. I fell in love with this movie because of its originality and the imagination that took in to realizing this movie, Christopher Nolan has yet again made another great movie. All the cast members did an amazing job with Inception. Thank you for making this movie, I'm sure i will see it plenty more times!"
23514,False,"Inception has been my most anticipated film of the year ever since that first teaser leaked telling us that our mind is the scene of a crime. Christopher Nolan has quite a reputation for making spectacular films and already has an impressive filmography under his belt, but everyone was wondering if there was any way he could top The Dark Knight. Well my friend, put those fantastical thoughts of wonderment to rest because Mr. Nolan has outdone himself.As soon as the film began, a chill went up my spine; a string of goosebumps. This doesn't happen very often and immediately I knew that this was going to be something special. Other than the extraordinary special effects, the most impressive aspect of the film is that every person in the main cast is important to the storyline. Even though this clearly revolves around Cobb, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Eames (Tom Hardy), Ariadne (Ellen Page), and Yusuf (Dileep Rao) are all given an appropriate amount of screen time and take full advantage of the time they're given. Every character has at least one moment where they have their time to shine, which is quite an accomplishment given how many people are in the cast. Even Saito (Ken Watanabe) and Robert Fischer, Jr. (Cillian Murphy) have their moments.The film is fabulously complex and there are so many things going on at once in the ladder half of the film that it results in the sci-fi actioner being incredibly difficult to spoil entirely without a longwinded explanation. I could tell you the last scene in the film right now and while it would make sense, things wouldn't fall into place or be entirely appreciated unless you knew everything leading up to that point.The film is superbly written. I'm a huge fan of films that make you think or are able to create something that at least feels like it's completely original and Inception accomplishes both of those things. On one hand, stealing anything you hold valuable from your dreams seems pretty far fetched. On the other, everyone dreams and everybody has secrets or at least something they keep locked away from most people. Imagining that those things are easily accessible to certain people because they've cracked the code on how to maneuver through your mental defenses is pretty intriguing and makes it seem easier to relate to since it's something everyone experiences.While everyone is waiting for the follow-up to The Dark Knight, Inception isn't the type of film that should be swept under the rug in the meantime. It's fantastically original, contains a spectacular cast where everyone involved delivers a strong performance, is wonderfully engrossing, and is definitely up to the high standard Christopher Nolan has set for himself with the other marvelous films on his resume. In typical Chris Nolan fashion, the ending is a huge tease but it's goosebump-worthy, completely fitting, and difficult to imagine the film ending any other way. Inception is Nolan's magnum opus and will be near impossible to beat as the movie of the year for 2010."
23515,False,"Only a small handful of directors have the ability to make an audience wait on pins and needles for their next NON sequel release. For me, i cannot remember the last time i was this excited for a movie i know virtually nothing about. Now i know i may be speaking on my own here, but director Christopher Nolan very well may be the best director of our generation. Because the guy has not missed so far. ""Memento"", ""The Prestige"", The Batman Series......the guy is a loose cannon who fires nothing but cinematic gold. As time goes on, he only seems to get better and better. Hopefully he can continue the re-occurring trend.Okay, let me get this off my chest, because it feels like an alien ready to burst out of my chest........this is easily one of the 10 best movies i have ever seen in my entire life. And that is not because i built this up in my mind or bought into the hype generated around this film, because everything i thought this movie was going to be, fell short of what it actually was about 20 minutes into it. This movie is cinematic genius at it's best, plain and simple. We have been due for a movie like this for a loooonnngggg time. And i don't mean this year, or the recent string of poor movies that have been released......i mean we are due for a movie that actually changes the way we look at movies. Now i know one would be quick to say ""Well wait a minute, Avatar already did that."". But that is where you would be wrong. James Cameron gave us a feast with ""Avatar"". This movie cooks you an entire Thanksgiving dinner.I could honestly sit here and try as hard as i could to try and describe the movie to you, and it wouldn't make a lick of sense because the movie is beyond in-depth. Case in point.....you remember the first time you saw the first ""Matrix"", and how complex and deep the plot was. Well, in words, this movie makes that idea look like ""Kindergarden Cop"". No disrespect to ""The Matrix"" at all, but this movie is probably the most in-depth, detailed, complex, and entertaining movie ever created by man.And that's all Nolan seems to do. He creates these scripts that almost take a life of their own. You get a glimpse of it in ""Memento"", and you certainly see it in action with ""The Prestige""......how the actual plot outline and story, is the actual trick. In this movie, it deals with mazes, and in turn, the whole movie is like a giant maze that you try and figure out.But that's where Nolan's true genius comes in. Through out the entire picture, he gives you these little clues as to whats going on, like a puzzle, and he shows you how they all get put together, rather than putting it together for you. He leaves it up to the audience to do so. And that's what makes this movie great, because he challenges the audience like no other movie i have ever seen.And speaking of things i have never seen. In order for a movie written this well to work, it must be shot in the same fashion. And Nolan, once again, out does himself. If you are a fan of cinematography, as i am as well, then this movie, literally, is your wet dream. Talking about these elaborate dream sequences is one thing, but seeing them in action is beyond anything you have ever seen on the silver screen. Throughout the entire film, i kept taking a napkin to my face to wipe the clumps of drool that were collecting at the bottom of my jaw.Bottom Line, this is a movie i could write a novel about, and it certainly deserves that attention. To pretty much sum it up, if you want to see the movie that is going to win best picture of the year, go and see this movie. If you want to see one of the best movies in the past 10 years, go and see this movie. If you want to see a movie that will pretty much change your method of thinking, then go and see this movie. God only knows how many movies i have seen in my lifetime, but i can say with complete just, that this is certainly one of the 10 best i have EVER seen."
23516,False,"The plot was unnecessarily drawn out and complex. My theory is that everyone that sees it just says it is great because they want people to think that they are intelligent. You may be intelligent, but if you fall for it you are not. The director obviously figured out the human psyche, knowing that people would say they liked it just because it is complex and they want others to think they are smart. Well it is not complex, they just made it ridiculous. It did not need to be so complex to get the one point the whole 3 hours made. It was not suspenseful at all. It might deserve a 3 or 4 but I give it a 1 for wasting my time and to help drag down the undeserving 9/10 that it has. I just now saw it because I didn't fall for the previews, I just saw it was in the top 250 so I decided to give it a chance. This just reinforces how dumb people are. The 10/10 ratings must have come from children and cognitively deficient individuals. Don't waste your time, and please don't buy or rent it. Download it off the internet, all you need is BitTorrent (free program) and then search ""Inception Torrent"" on google, the first hit is usually the file you need. You can burn it to a DVD or watch it on your computer! Please god (imaginary, but a good phrase) don't pay to see it."
23517,False,"I'm trying very hard to be fair here. Given my high expectations and all the praise, it's hard not to bite back. So I'll temper my initial review (""Sitting through Inception was more disappointing and more frustrating than discovering my first girlfriend was cheating on me"") with this one: ""Inception buried everything that I might have loved about it 10 feet under things that were terrible.""What I hoped for: Dreaming as an exploration of character, plumbing the depths of people's imagination to discover their secrets and find out who they truly are. Dreaming as journey through fantasy: impossible landscapes, surreal physics. Something that might exist at the intersection of The Matrix, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and August Strindberg's A Dream Play.And I trusted Nolan to deliver. In Memento and The Prestige, he gave himself a unique set of rules for telling a story and used them magnificently. In his Batman films, he found humanity amid tense action and explored deeper themes than you usually expect from a franchise blockbuster.What we got: Exposition, exposition, exposition, bad action, bad action, bad action, wisps of story (and mostly the wrong story). Oh, and a lot of decently talented actors who never stopped being decently talented actors to become their characters (by my count, only two people had any motivation for their actions).I've been asleep before so I didn't expect to need a primer on dreaming. But no, movie dreaming is full of rules. Roughly the first hour of Inception is dedicated to cataloging these: what happens when you die, how much time passes while you dream (mind you it changes when you have a dream inside a dream), differences between imagined and remembered places, the types of sedatives you need, how you know you're asleep, etc etc etc.This becomes especially frustrating because many of the dream physics are quickly superseded by different dream physics. For instance, we're first told one thing happens when you die in a dream (which is important to establish a character's motivation), but then later we're told something else entirely will happen (because the movie would have had even less sense of danger if dying wasn't bad for our protagonists). Not only that, but some of these dream rules are nothing but Chekhovian peashooters- existing only to set up a single action later in the film.To be completely fair, bits of this exposition take place against the backdrop of a gorgeous and surreal dreamscape (one of only two moments where dreaming feels magical).Where was that sense of surreal dream non-reality distinctly lacking? The action sequences, which account for another hour of the movie.There are two ways, in my estimation, to make action scenes exciting. The first one requires you to make the audience genuinely uncertain whether the protagonists can prevail. This is no easy task. Usually, it necessitates breaking narrative conventions so your audience can't figure out the plot points in advance. If we're at the one hour mark and a couple armed goons pop up, then you've got to work damn hard to convince me they can actually hurt the protagonist. Maybe you had a different experience with Inception, but I never held my breath when the guns came out.The second way to make action scenes worthwhile is to make the action itself so damn fun or engrossing that the audience doesn't care if it can predict the ending. I know Bruce Lee is going to win his fight, but I'll watch it for the choreography. I've seen Wesley outfence Inigo a dozen times, but the quips could fuel dozens more viewings. There's no question that Axe Cop is going to kill the bad guys, but did I expect him to do it by hurling a baby with a unicorn horn? No. No I did not.This is one of the failures of Inception for me. There's so much combat, but it all devolves into tired clichés (with the notable exception of some of Gordon-Levitt's scenes- the only other moment where I experienced anything dream-like). I always felt that the writers failed to exploit the infinite creative possibility available to characters like Neo and Hal Jordan, but dodging bullets and firing green blobs seems downright inspired next to Nolan's dream goons with their AK-47s.So one hour of exposition, one hour of bad action, what's left? Half an hour of story or, rather, two stories. One story is about a business man wanting to steal from another business man in a convoluted way. Or something. I didn't care because the business men lacked any motivation and they kept getting in the way of what should have been the only story: unraveling Cobb's secrets.What might have been: I've hated movies before and I'm not normally inclined to write reviews for them. So what's different here? Well, it's frustration that this could have been amazing when it was truly awful.The premise has legs- sturdy, exciting legs. Dreaming is often a magical experience. Lucid dreaming, when it happens, is even more magical, giving your rational brain the freedom to play in an irrational world. Lucid dreamers sharing a dream? Fantastic. Lucid dreamers trespassing in dreams with weaponized imaginations? I don't know how you could ruin that premise.And there was the kernel of something good in there- not just hallway good, but really damn good. I cared about Cobb's story. I wanted to watch Cobb's story. Unfortunately, two hours and fifteen minutes of terrible movie got in the way of Cobb's story."
23518,False,"All that stuff about sharing dreams makes zero scientific or philosophical sense. And no-one can have dreams with that amount of detail, that many actors, that much lightning fast action, etc, etc. Read Daniel Dennett. There were plenty of stunning special effects and stunts certainly, but I had the feeling throughout that the plot was just a peg to hang these on. If you want to see how to do dreams in cinema, look elsewhere, for example the dream sequence in Wild Strawberries, the Soldier's dreams in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, the whole of Un Chien Andalou. Even Buster Keaton did better than this in Sherlock Junior 80-odd years ago.If you're going to make a film about dreaming, first figure out how to film dreams."
23519,False,"In my opinion the IMDb review by Carl_Tait from New York, NY is about the best summation of the film. A great concept but lost in translation. And to think Mr. Nolan wrote the story for ""Inception""!!! I include ""Inception"" among the film genre that have come to be known as ""mind**ck"" films. I don't agree with every list of films characterized thus on the web but this is an unmistakable genre. And ""Inception"" definitely belongs there.I suspect there are a lot of viewers out there who see a complex but convoluted film and find it gripping because BAM!! it hits them so hard on the head that they dare not concede they don't understand it because they are afraid someone will find out that they didn't :-) But there are a number of IMDb reviewers who have given ""Inception"" 10/10 or close to that rating. The way these reviewers have articulated their reasoning is definitely more comprehensible and cogent than the film is in my opinion. I wish Mr. Nolan had consulted them before making the film as I am sure they could bring some clarity to the mix.To my mind ""Inception"" has a convoluted and twisted narrative (if there is one) which *seems* multi-layered, but actually throws just about everything it can into the mix, never mind the sink, it throws in even the kitchen itself. I will say that the CGI effects are pretty amazing. But the film is overpopulated with characters and it was hard to figure out why more than half of them were there.And as another reviewer commented, what the heck are the guns and explosions doing in a film based on a shared dream paradigm.""Inception"" gave me no reason to care for any of the characters, excepting to some degree Ellen Page's character Ariadne. I had no reason to care for Marion Cotillard's character Mal, and found her portrayal somewhat of a female stereotype playing the neurotic unhinged foil.I am sure Mr. Nolan is an excellent film maker who has definitely come into his own as far as the box office is concerned. But so far the only films he has done that I have truly admired are ""Insomnia"" and ""Batman Begins"". Before ""Batman Begins"" I was never a fan of any of the Batman films.While watching ""Inception"" there was many a time that I felt like stopping and watching something else but gave it the benefit of doubt that the film might pick-up. Sorry to say it never did.I do hope Mr.Nolan gives a little more attention to maintaining a narrative and character development in his films rather than just bombarding us with complexity (or more accurately confusion!) and CGI effects.All I can say is that ""Inception"" is exhausting viewing and represents complexity for the sake of complexity or something like that....."
23520,False,"This film has been seriously hyped - like many other viewers, I expected much more than it delivered. Almost everyone has had that experience of being disappointed by a film that you have been really looking forward to - this was a prime example. First of all the acting - Keanu Reeves and Joseph Gordon-Levitt - separated at birth, and neither can act at all. I liked Ellen Page very much in Juno, but she was sadly miscast in this role. Not that any actress could have made sense out of her character - she was at random times a newbie, who needed the basics explained, and/or an authority on how the whole thing worked. The plot was filled with these messy holes, but it wasn't entirely negative - some of the effects were fun, and DiCaprio is always good, as was most of his supporting cast. On the whole, worth seeing, just don't expect it to be the best film you ever saw."
23521,False,"One has to look no further than at this two and one half hour bag of hot air to understand why American film is on life support. In what would have made for an absorbing thirty minute Twilight Zone episode in the mid sixties has been (through the wonder of technology) turned into a flashy and noisy blockbuster as director Chris Nolan applies lipstick to this pig by the bucket. Cobb (Leonard DiCaprio) is a dream stealer in a land and time not far from now. He's particularly valuable to corporations keen on getting an edge on competitors but now in order to go legit and see his kiddies again he must do the reverse. Impossible you say, not in Chris Nolan's fantasy land of computer generated gimmickry and circuitous dialog.Inception's slick dishonesty lies in the parallel universe of the real and unreal worlds Nolan creates in an attempt to humanize its disheveled super hero by giving it a patina of reality and generate sympathy for Cobb. But Cobb along with everyone else acts like a stilted automaton (or Joe Friday from Dragnet) and while it try's redistributing its weight to give balance to the money shots (you know the fireworks) it comes across mawkish and syrupy. The premise itself is hashed and rehashed ad nauseum and so much one gets the idea that the producers are not only attempting to blind with shock and awe but confuse you with non-sequitors in hopes of successfully cloning you to buy another ticket.Even in the real world it is based Inception remains a fairy tale working off the borderless freedom of fantasy where things don't have to be logical just convenient. Nolan was far more successful in bringing the fantasy reality factor closer together in Insomnia and Memento. There was a grittier tension in these low budgets that Nolan has lost since hitting the big time and having at his disposal a huge budget for all star casts ( mostly wasted in minor roles here) and exotic locales to play out his ideas. These productions (Batmans plus The Prestige) may spare no expense but they lack soul and usually flounder mid way.While the blame can be clearly affixed to the the shoulders of writer, producer, director Nolan I would be remiss not to acknowledge cinematographer Wally Pfister's murky and dull compositions and Hans Zimmers relentless music score which plays like a leaky faucet throughout the entire film. Like an IV it attempts to transfuse suspense into the plot with an annoying undercurrent and the occasional crash of brass."
23522,False,"It has received so many positive reviews because nobody dares say it was made based on very illiterate understanding of human mind and dream psychology. Similar to the story of the silly naked king who thought he wore the most beautiful dress that only wise people could see, and so no one dared say they could not see any dress on him! OK, so we use a briefcase containing a large button and a few wires to enter anyone's dream and if you have an architect with you, the whole thing will be somehow just fine, and all these details that happen there are somebody's projection or memory, or ... but don't worry because someone will tell you what they are! Not enough? OK, you will be able to use the dream version of that briefcase machine to still move one layer deeper, and go to the dreams of a dreaming person?! How stupid that this get? Seeing all these positive reviews I just realize the brilliance of the naked king with invisible clothes to stupid people. I am not against novel concepts, Matrix was such a novel one, but inception is a mockery of science, human mind, dream psychology, and more! 4 stars only for the special effects."
23523,False,"Nolan is careful never to let the scope of the film overwhelm the human element and this is a key reason Inception works as well as it does. The acting, from a great ensemble led by DiCaprio, is as good as it gets. In terms of sheer originality, ambition and achievement, Inception is the movie of the summer, the movie of the year and the movie of our dreams. world need directors like Nolan,Spielberg,Cameron, As with his previous movies, Nolan displays a knack for choosing actors who can best embody the characters in his films. While DiCaprio's role here may be reminiscent of that in his earlier Shutter Island, there's no question that he anchors the movie with a perfectly calibrated performance that is equal parts intense and heartfelt. The rest of the supporting characters fill out their roles just as vividly- Joseph Gordon-Levitt radiates confidence and suavity, Ellen Page displays suitable wit and grit, and in particular Marion Cotillard exudes both sultriness and danger in an edgy yet eventually heartbreaking performance.But ""Inception"" is Nolan's vision through and through- and in fact, a visionary director and a master filmmaker at that. Many years Nolan spent refining his screenplay, and it shows in the great detail and complexity that makes ""Inception"" both an intellectual and visceral enjoyment- just take the names of the various characters, each of which have a special significance. With ""Inception"", Nolan invites you to open your mind to possibilities- possibilities of alternate realities, of complexities beyond the conscious mind to grasp and most importantly, of the power of imagination. It is that rare gem of a film that is so multi-layered, so profound and so fascinating that you'll want to experience it again immediately after you've seen it- just so you can fully appreciate its genius."
23524,False,"How this is number 13 in the list is beyond me. It wasn't that I didn't get it, it was more that I did get it, but didn't get what the big deal was about. Going inside people's dreams - big wow.The special effects were pretty clever, but that is no substitute for quality plots or acting.That this has been voted an average 8.8 by your common sci-fi nerd unfortunately undermines the best film site on the net, which is a shame because the 'top 250' is usually a good democratic film review. That is except when it is hijacked by what is tantamount to troll pressure group."
23525,False,Like many others I cannot see this as a work of genius at all and believe this to be a really stupid movie.The dream team that can manipulate your dreams and waking ideas - Yeah Right - 'in your dreams'. That about sums it all up.The movie writes it's own rule book regarding dreams and assumes that time moves exponentially more slowly when you dream within dreams. There is no evidence for this as fact and my experience and understanding is that dreams can go both ways - sometimes an epic takes minutes and others an action takes hours.So having said that the whole conceptual context falls apart and crumbles into absurdity. And why would movement in a dream affect a dream within a dream as occurs in this movie? When you dream you leave the real world behind - until you awaken.This movie has been compared with the Matrix trilogy. Well it blatantly rips it off but that's another dream - or rather a fantasy. This movie doesn't even come close to Matrix which was truly original and at a stretch even plausible. This isn't.
23526,False,"I am not going to discuss any particular event or reveal the beginning or ending to this two and a half hour ear & butt buster . However , I will warn anyone from walking into the theater unaware of what the storyline is about . I saw Shutter Island and really enjoyed DiCaprio's performance despite some negative reviews it got from professional critics . ...... So I paid my $12 bucks and bought a ticket for Inception and walked in without knowing what to expect . I thought this film would be more of a psychological thriller but I was mistaken . I found myself trying to play catch-up with this confusing plot from start to finish . I remember seeing people floating around in zero gravity, machine guns blazing , bombs exploding , buildings collapsing , numerous car crashes , and lots and lots of chase scenes , fights, falls, and natural disasters . Just about everything you would expect to see in any big budget summer action flick . By the time this long movie ended I couldn't have cared less . As I exited the theater I looked at the faces of my fellow movie goers . No one commented on how good it was or how much it stunk . They just looked relieved this unnecessarily long nightmare was over and quietly left . Most people here who took the time to review this picture apparently were not disappointed as I was . So I guess I'm in the minority of unhappy of Inception reviewers . If I could re-edit this movie I would 1) Chop off one hour . 2) Remove all dialog . 3) Speed up the film . 4) Change the soundtrack to that of The Benny Hill Show . ......... The next time I feel in need of another nightmare adventure I think I'll take an Ambien and hop in my clothes dryer .. I gave this movie a 4 because of some really good special effects ... ( Not so Hot ) ... P.W.H."
23527,False,"I haven't got the faintest idea of what this is about. Perhaps something about controlling other people's dreams, to get what you want. In this case it's once again the evil corporation, which wants to rule the world. OK, great.In fact there is no plot or five running at the same time. You decide. You can see Paris upside down if you're interested, but really, the time when we got impressed by computer tricks is since long over.Together with all the quasi-intellectualism in the dialog, this is very hard to stand and not even entertaining. Something is wrong when you're bored already after two minutes and then, there are more than 140 minutes to go. A serious warning about this."
23528,False,"People have written much longer reviews so I am not going to go there. I saw it about 2 years ago and all I can say about it is arrrrrggggggghhhh! I almost hit my head on the coffee table from falling asleep twice. Can't remember much about it except that I found it hard to grasp and when I did...I did not care. I normally don't go to extremes when reviewing things, whether it is restaurants, hotels or movies. I always believe the truth is somewhere in the middle but this movie, and then the adulation heaped upon it made me mad!!!! Think Elaine from Seinfeld after watching the English Patient and you have how I feel. Thank you!!"
23529,False,"Beyond boring, had to turn it off. The story line is retarded, it is very confusing. The only reason I would even give it one star is because Leonardo and the girl from Juno are good. The special effects were overdone and so unrealistic it made it even more boring. The whole concept of this movie is so unrealistic I can't even take it. ""projections of my subconscious?"". Dreams within dreams within dreams within dreams I am bored to tears watching this movie. Dreams come alive and then dreams and subconscious and dreams you just can't control, I guess I am into realistic movies. This movie is crap and I would seriously suggest sticking needles in your eyes before I watched this, that would be seriously more entertaining."
23530,False,"It's an original idea to introduce the alternate world of someone's mind as the place of the action, and by this i mean doing voluntary, deterministic, cause and effect actions that do affect the reality of the character involved. I'm not a great movie fan, i don't really make a goal for myself in following some trend or idea in the movie world, let's just say I feel sometimes the TV set has too much control on the movies I watch, :), and coming from this I dare to say that the theme is not quite present in the past years, and this is a good thing to start with for a success movie. But besides being an original idea, i think it's followers failed to make the most out of it. My point is that if you try to extract from the movie the specific of this new world they discovered for us you can see it's not too much. You can bend the cityscape, you can make the things explode, there are new specializations for the people involved (some create and some just act), and somehow you can keep some dead people consciousness trapped inside this world, and there's a door to some dark other world where these dead people go. And this is all about this mind world. The bad thing is that this is not enough. It's not enough developed for us and it was not enough for this movie authors. Apart from this comes a load of pop-corn movie elements which you can see in every typical action movie: they run a lot, they shot each other a lot, and that's about all. So the specific of the mind world is left apart, and the action movie takes too much. In this sense I say it's a lost opportunity. Too bad for them - the movie industry - that they spoiled us with such great movies as ""Solaris"", ""Dark City"", ""Sin City"", ""Immortel"" and a lot more - some of my favourite movies ever - and learned us what to expect from such alternate reality worlds and ideas. This movies have fully developed worlds in which the original element or idea is led to take entirely over the world and action and it's doing it so good ! The action of such movies can't be the same outside these movies and in this sense we can say these movies ideas are fully grown and developed. And this is the major shortcoming of ""Inception"", it can be more, it's a lost opportunity to do a really great movie with a novel idea."
23531,False,"there are some great ideas that blow your mind when you first see them on screen. in the inception genre, matrix did that. it was fresh and left an impact long after one had seen the movie. great plot, screenplay, direction, editing... the 'dream' idea had that potential but inception hardly does justice to it. the plot is not engaging, it's confusing. the action sequences are lame and clichéd and hardly grab you. there are some nice special effects but for them you don't need to see the movie, the trailer is enough. i wonder what's wrong with movie watchers. they have played right into the hands of the marketing team and bought the hype. rather than using their own sensibilities, i think they are too embarrassed to call a lemon a lemon, fearing 'how can i call it bad when everyone is going ga ga over it.' a below average movie, rated highly by below average audience."
23532,False,"This film is overrated. Besides being accompanied by a score determined to set you to sleep there's really no filmmaking here that sets it above the rest.The plot is very interesting and, for the most part, well conceived. However, the characters do too much talking simply explaining to the audience what the meaning of their actions are. Why assume the audience is inept?The basis of the plot itself is where film most earns its grade. This is truly a unique idea for the screen. Unfortunately, it was denigrated by the unnecessary dumbing down of the story and the unimpressive acting of the cast.No matter what the subject of a movie, to end it with the question of whether it was all a dream or not is not clever."
23533,False,"Went to see this film recently and was very disappointed. I was expecting something amazing given the extremely high IMDb rating - couldn't have been more disappointed with this movie.The special effects were good, but apart from that, I think the film didn't work particularly well and it's totally over-rated.The acting was nothing amazing and the story is not as clever as it pretends to be. I agree with some other reviewers on here, that this film passes itself off as being very intelligent and clever but only for people who don't have any intelligence and are easily pleased.I like Nolan's other work - Dark Knight was excellent, however, this movie is nowhere near as good and felt pretty lame.I think a lot of people who don't even understand this movie, just gave it a high rating assuming it was a clever movie when it actually wasn't that good at all.This movie is certainly 'not' a masterpiece or anything even close. It felt like a Matrix wannabe, but I have to say The Matrix blows this movie out of the water by a huge margin.As I write this review, this movie is currently in the top 3 movies of all time?? I've never been more shocked - get real people. It seems the film companies are paying people to vote on here and boost their films - there can be no other explanation. Very disappointing and was expecting so much more from this movie. Don't bother paying to see it in the cinema as you will feel let down."
23534,False,"The only moments that had dream-like qualities in the movie were the times I dozed off & my own dreams (many times more imaginative I might add) took over. To be blunt about it, Inception is not so much about dreams as about the world of video games. Even more telling than the gratuitous CGI effects was the clunky narrative device of having the characters explain in overly verbose dialog where & when each segment was taking place (levels, locations, psychological motivations, etc.). Like having to follow instructions of a poorly designed game. Ugh. The popularity of this snoozer is very sad testimony to the mediocrity of the average movie-going intelligence."
23535,False,"Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite directors and Memento & The Dark Knight are my favourite movies but for the first time I am disappointed with his movie Inception. The film is all about is all about stealing & planting ideas in people's mind by using their dreams.The idea of the movie is good but the bad screenplay, 2.5 hours length that drags really badly, plot holes & unanswered questions & Cobb's annoying wife ruined the whole movie.Inception is supposed to be a movie that requires multiple views to understand it like Memento but there is no way I will watch it again for the second time because it wasn't that confusing and it boring throughout. The dream sequences were not dreamlike and only the hotel dream looked cool. Cobb's wife was so annoying that I wanted to pull my arm out and constantly bash my head with it. There were so many unanswered questions like what year is the movie set in? Why does Cobb steal ideas and now he has to plant one? It was 2.5 hours long and they still couldn't explain anything.Inception isn't even original it is ripped off from a Japanese animated movie called ""Paprika"" which was out in 2006.I don't know why it is #3 on the IMDb top 250 it is not a visionary masterpiece or anything and it is only about 80% on rotten tomatoes and there are many great movies with 90+% on rotten tomatoes and they are not on the top 250 like Run Lola Run.It is nothing but an over hyped movie and the film makers must of written that ""Inception is good"" on a piece of paper and planted it in people's mind although it's not."
23536,False,"I can't believe the favourable reviews this movie gets...the movie has no sense of coherence, terrible plot, very dubious arguments, and only slightly salvageable performances by the main actors... i am a huge fan of SciFci/thriller/philosophical movies but this one is so mediocre that the comparisons to the Matrix series is simply insulting to anyone with single digit IQs who watched them. Seriously, the movie is horrible.. Being a huge movie fan I can stand all genres of movies and all qualities, good and bad...And out of the 1000+ movies (i watch 50+ movies a year since i've been a teenager) I've watched in my lifetime this movie was going to become only the 3rd movie to cause me to walk out of the theatre... The only two movies i ever walked out of were (yes, i remember b/c they were THAT bad): The Lawnmower Man and The Avengers (with Ralph Fiennes)...So yes, Inception is almost AVENGERS bad...you get the idea... I didn't walk out just b/c i was killing time for a later date."
23537,False,"What on earth has happened to character development in cinema? I was pretty pumped to see Inception. It looked flashy, decent actors, and what appeared to actually be a new idea for a plot (I'm REAL tired of rehashed plots).You were thrown into the film with characters that had NO basis of who they were. I didn't have a chance to decide if I liked a character through who they were. Lead actor played his usual flat self. He reminds me of the Al Pacino school of acting graduate. I didn't care anything about him or his ""team"".There were so stinkin' many visual flaws, goofs, and editing mistakes I lost count of which ones I would start with after the movie.The best thing about this movie is that I had a free pass given to me by my boss!"
23538,False,"I saw it last week and really don't get the hype. OK, the idea is nice, but the movie itself is just like any other Mission Impossible of Oceans Eleven franchise. It is a boring heist movie. Apart from that the characters are lame. DiCaprio plays the same person as in Shutter Island and the action scenes are completely out dated. I thought I was Watching an Bond movie from the 80's from time to time. And why did they have to explain everything. I'm not stupid. Just a quick run through and we could have started. Nolan took over an hour to explain everything..... Why. No I also did not like Memento, so maybe Nolan's puzzles are not my cup of teaNo, this movie is not what I had hoped."
23539,False,"Christopher Nolan burst to stardom with the stunningly good, low-budget Memento. Since then, his hubris has got the better of him, and the more money he has to spend on movies the worse they become.Inception is all splash - yet positively awful. It is classic blockbuster in the sense that all critics were bought off with its excessive promotional budget. How every single critic gave this rubbish maximum ratings can only be explained by a bribe (do the math: as an example, a $20M budget to buy off all of ~500 critics is about $40,000 per reviewer. The difference between a 2-star and a 4-star rating will guarantee to translate to much more than $20M).All huge-budget blockbusters are the same. This one has reached the zenith of promotional ingenuity.The movie is not complex as many dodos would believe. It is boringly slow and attempts to be convoluted just so you can be duped into thinking it is deep and meaningful. The best part of the film is the last 10 seconds - the only true suspense happens in these few moments. Ironically I got pleasure from seeing my partner fall asleep during the last hour : at the end of the movie I was very curious to know if she remembered her dream ..."
23540,False,Looking at the overall rating of 8.8 I had to write this review because in my opinion this movie does not deserve a rating of more than 5. There are so many plot holes in this movie that it really makes you wonder whether director even cared. I would not go into the details as the other reviewers have already pointed out but for me its a promise unfulfilled. I have always considered Christopher Nolan to be an amazing director but with this one he probably got confused himself or devised convenient ways to resolve plot twists. The movie does have some entertainment value but when you begin to think of the plot it leaves you with a feeling of having been cheated. I would have given it a 5 for its characters and decent graphics but the insipid linear plot line and and an undeserved rating on IMDb forces me to do my part and bring it the level where it should be.
23541,False,"As Christopher Nolan's budgets get bigger, his movies get worse. He is an excellent director when he is given a project that isn't overly ambitious. With his more ""epic"", ""blockbuster"" films though, he shows a lot more weaknesses. Nothing illustrates those weaknesses more than Inception. It is a movie that starts off at the same level as Memento, but declines and hits rock bottom on the same level as the recent Transformers movies. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the last 45 minutes or so of the movie is that bad. It is nothing but the same loud, poorly shot, poorly choreographed, and boring action that has spread throughout movies nowadays like a disease.For at least the first hour, I could see why this movie got such great reviews. It presents itself initially as a dark and surreal Ocean's Eleven. The first act is spent acquainting us with the rules of dream thievery while the main character, Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), assembles his ""safecracking"" team. In typical caper movie fashion, he finds the specialists that he needs, all of whom have their own talents and personalities. There is the chemist who will whip up the special cocktail needed to sedate everyone for this special job. There the dream actor who can impersonate anyone. There is the financier who hired Cobb and wants to come along to monitor his investment. There is the architect responsible for building the dreamscapes in which the ""safecrackers"" will pull off their caper. The target of this scheme is Robert Fischer (Cilian Murphy), the sole heir to a huge corporate empire. The purpose of this scheme is not to steal anything, but to implant the idea into Fischer's head that he should break up his father's empire. To do that, Cobb and his buddies concoct an incredibly complex scheme that involves a dream within a dream within a dream.For a while, I thought that I was in heaven. But then, in Act II when the caper officially starts, I began to feel doubts. Within minutes, there is a massive car chase and the bullets are flying from all directions. When the dreaming starts, you get a taste of what the rest of the movie is going to be like. Tons and tons of shooting, chases, and action that drags on and on despite having almost no relevance to the plot. It's bad in the dream, it's pretty bad in the dream within a dream, and Holy Jesus, is it ever awful in the dream within a dream within a dream.As the movie progresses, the action becomes more pointless and the action scenes become progressively harder to follow. Dozens of guys who dress like Secret Service agents are gunned down or karate chopped to death. Approximately a half hour is one gigantic non-stop action scene that takes place across all of the dream levels. While the idea of a half hour of non-stop action might sound nice, it drags horribly. Almost no plot development takes place this entire time. There is a shot of a van slowly falling towards the water. Across the long action scene, that van is shown about five or six times. By the time that you are done with this movie, you will be sick to death of seeing that stupid van falling towards the water.Why is it that this movie can't make gunfire and car chases exciting? For starters, the action is very poorly choreographed. You get no sense of location. The challenges that the good guys are facing aren't clearly laid out. Who is where? How many bad guys are there? What you do get is good old shaky-cam, loads of CGI, Matrix-inspired floating, and close-ups of dudes shooting guns. In other words, you get the crap that has virtually destroyed action movies nowadays. Today's directors could learn a lot from action classics like Commando and Die Hard.Speaking of CGI, this movie also has tons of that, and it is technologically impressive, but mostly pointless. The one scene that everybody seems to rave about is the Paris scene where half of the city gets folded in over itself. Eh  whatever. It looks cool, but  who cares? When did this become part of having a great movie? And why is it that the Road Warrior and the original Star Wars still look cooler to me than modern movies with five times the budget?While I enjoyed most of the non-action parts, this also is probably Nolan's most pretentious movie. The movie starts with the line ""What is the most resilient parasite?"" The answer: ""an idea"". What is this twaddle? Ideas aren't like parasites. I'm constantly seeing ideas brought up, shot down, and forgotten about. And why do you need to tell me this  to look smart? Inception is constantly throwing new dream rules at you, and by the end they are a confusing mess. It is these kinds of problems that inspire people to criticize Inception as being a dumb movie that tries to position itself as a smart one.To sum it all up, I think that Inception, in 20 years, will not be viewed by Christopher Nolan fans as one of his best. In fact, I believe that it is his worst film. This guy cannot do good action, and when he has a budget to spend, it seems to just make the movie longer and prettier, but not better. From these criticisms, you might get the impression that I hated the movie. I didn't. Even during the most boring scenes, I wanted the whole scheme to work, and I cared about Dom Cobb enough to be hoping that he would triumph in the end. I did enjoy it enough to watch the movie a second time, just to see if I would like it better. I had the same feelings again  falling in love at first, only to be disappointed in the end."
23542,False,"Pretentious, pointless, action-obsessed titillation. Pretentious because it pretends to present a new interpretation on a big, daring subject: dreams. But it doesn't. The execution is not even consistent with itself, doesn't make sense half the time and is entirely unenjoyable to watch because there is no character development and not story built. All you get are famous actors and expensive action scenes played on a background of unoriginal, repetitive music. This movie doesn't even measure up to the worst Hollywood crapola. Anyone who calls this movie a ""new religion"" is deluded by marketing and style devoid of any substance."
23543,False,"What a dreadful and tiresome movie to watch. I tried to finish it thrice but know for sure I never will. Just a mash of silly ideas wrapped around compulsory CGI with hopelessly miscast actors who looked liked they just walked off the set of an after school special.Apart from the plagiarized idea of this dream infiltration business, the storyline never rose above the grade of an 80's Bond flick. Not a likable or non cookie cutter character on screen and the constant drawn out exposition got seriously annoying even after a short while.I frankly don't think it's an exaggeration when I say that I've seen episodes of the Simpsons with a more intricate plot. And yet people are stumbling over each other commending the complexity of this brainless blockbuster action cliché. I'm not particularly thick, but for the love of God people..I best get me a towel, I'm getting off this planet."
23544,False,"This has to be for me one of the biggest load of monkey crap i have ever seen.i was bored throughout the whole movie.The best part was when the credits rolled.I enjoy movies like time cop and total recall etc,but i really couldn't enjoy this no matter how much i tried to.I don't know how this got an 8/10 rating to be honest.If you are bored and have nothing else to do,you will just be even more bored watching this.I enjoyed Leonardo DiCaprio in movies like Titanic,Catch me if you can,The Beach etc.But this is one of his worst for me personally.I have now wasted two and half hours of my life, which i will never get back.Watching this movie makes me think comeback Steven Seagal all is forgiven.I think i need to lie down after having watched this awful film.I love films and have watched a lot over the years.And sometimes if i like them i will watch them again,This i definitely wont be watching again.I don't drink,but this movie would drive you to it."
23545,False,"I often compare movie ratings with religion. Just because most people say it's so, doesn't mean it is. This is particularly true for this pretentious piece of c$%p. To echo that of previous reviewers, weak plot, overly confusing attempt at creating another 'dream movie'. I attempted to watch this film 4 times, refusing to accept that I couldn't 'get it'. The fourth attempt lasted slightly longer as I wanted to give it more attention. However, boredom soon set in and I found myself reaching for the remote control once more.It really amazes me that people can enjoy watching such pap. If you want to watch a good dream movie then try 'Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind'"
23546,False,"I wish to god that IMDb would allow you to vote with a minus rating because, if I could i would rate this movie -10. This is the all time worst movie of my life and I want the 2 and a half hours back. While watching this junk I actually thought i was dreaming and in a bad nightmare, then the phone rang and I realized that I was just watching a horrible peace of sh!!!!T. I actually signed up for this site just for this dirty peace of toilet paper they call a script. I had to watch this movie in four parts not being able to stomach more than 40 minutes at a time. To keep it plain and simple I would not even make someone on death row watch this movie even if it was his last request. Let me plant an Inception in your head and tell you not to watch this movie. It's movies like this that put Block Buster out of business and why movie sales are down."
23547,False,"Can't believe the high reviews as I think it's the worst Nolan productions to date. Means: it's a good/average movie, but not great.The whole movie is just too stylistic, the romance is cold and uninteresting, the characters are one dimensional, and the whole dream thing is just too stylistic. The movie wants to be too intelligent for its own good. I preferred how dreams where presented in ""Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind"": blurry, not cohesive stories and unpredictable.Inception used dreamworlds as a cheap way of adding car chases, shoot outs in snow. The whole dream-in-dream thing is nice but doesn't add anything to the story.The romance thingie is just annoying to watch. I just don't care. But I should.Meh."
23548,False,"...this is what 'Matrix' on steroids? I didn't finish watching this overrated pile of nonsense as the 'soap opera' subplot made what ever ending was planned impossible to care about.Never ending 'staccato' of guns shooting in: Tibet, Paris, Los Angeles (passing for NYC), in cars, out of cars, in buildings - on and on.Worse was the wife of DiCapprio - if one is going to write a story make it engaging.I have to say the more I 'see' 'heavies' assaulting the public through brawls, shootings, threats - the more it looks like a short career choice based on declining ability and brains. True actors actresses understand the ubiquitous chase scenes and shoot em' ups are filler because a script can't be coherently portrayed. I lost interest after one hour and pulled the disc before hour two was about to begin."
23549,False,"Christopher Nolan has undoubtedly become one of the most important names in the business of contemporary filmed entertainment.He has taken us to places we did not know existed.He singlehandedly revived a languishing cartoon franchise and placed it in the pantheon of unforgettable classics. In his new adventure he takes on the uncharted universe of the subconscious. The premise in its scope is intriguing and unconceivable ambitious.he relies on the best movie making talent only a major movie studio can buy to achieve his goal.The special effects are terrific, the acting is pretty good, and the dialogue is also good, but the journey that started as an unrestrained adventure into the realms of the human thought generating universe turned half way thru into a tale of semi confusing scenes. The story never comes anywhere near of seducing its audience. The emotional factor is completely absent.The movie is worth watching and it does stand out mostly due to lack of quality competition, but it should not be an Oscar nominee. Christopher Nolan has done better work."
23550,False,"Regardless of my definitive opinion, this is a 'sensational' film and a mind-bending one like I've never seen before. And guess what ? I think I was victim of its own concept since I went through four stages of reviews with ""Inception"", one within another (naturally) :REVIEW 1 : Ecstasy in Perception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""This is not a film, This is an experience ... a cinematic ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" ... This is why I love movies ... why imagination is the greatest human gift ... why I dream to write such creative and intelligent stories ... And still ... I don't know how to feel ... Movies like this should be praised and loved ... I loved it, but I feel something messy now in my mind, and that I can't get out ... I need to watch it again ... this is not a movie to watch once ... definitely ... it's so disturbing it's great, so great it's disturbing ..."" 10/10This is the raw feeling, authentic? sincere? naive? well it was the immediate one, one that couldn't be altered by other viewer's opinions, praises or criticisms. This is how I felt when the movie ended. A second watching transported me from ecstasy in perception to ...REVIEW 2 : Originality in Conception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""It's a dazzling intelligence-challenging puzzle, but only on an intellectual level, not emotional. Why not? Should all the movies have a 'heart' beating inside ... as long as it makes yours do. Now I understand the film and love it because I decided not to care for the emotion and just try to understand the story. And with this mindset, believe me, ""Inception"" is an incredible experience. The movie is a fantasy and remains realistic in the same time, it's real because we know it's fake, but the fake world feels so real because we can technically live in. It doesn't say anything about dreams and subconsciousness, because it's all about actual and virtual reality, perceptions and intentions. As a script, it's a very impressive work from Christopher Nolan, not to mention the brilliant editing. Yes, I know I'm watching a film, but this one I value as an intricate puzzle that challenges my intelligence. ""Inception"" is like a cinematic Rubik's cube."" 9,5/10I was still loving the film, but in the meantime, starting to concede that the enjoyment was more on a technical level, on the construction of the plot and the intricacy of the script ... I admitted that the whole Mal-Cobb subplot was just plot devices to insert a melodrama, necessary to plunge us in Cobb's subconscious and inject it into Fisher's dreams, combining this way two parallel worlds, two narrative structures. In such action-driven films, 'forced' is 'flat' and melodrama must be handled carefully. The movie was perceived as excellent by my humble mind, but more in a cinematographic, geometric, almost pragmatic way ... which brings me to ...REVIEW 3 : Enthusiasm in Reception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""It's a great film that should grab the Oscars for Best Original Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Visual Effects, Sound Effects, Best Cinematography. If it didn't, there would be no justice!"" 8/10I knew I enjoyed the movie because as I mentioned before, it featured great thrills, action, script, music, editing, visuals ... hence the word 'sensational' I used in the beginning of this review. But as I titled in another review : ""many elements of greatness don't necessarily make a great film"". I started to question myself. It's a film about dreams, about subconscious, right? but did I sense a real escapism in those supposedly dreamy settings? didn't those dreams look a little bit like micro-episodes from formulaic action films? could the fights (or anything for that matter) be more imaginative? did the Mal-Cobb subplot make me feel sympathy for any of them? did I really care for Cobb? or did Leo make me care for his character? did I care for the whole mission? did any of the characters appeal to me? So many interrogation marks leading me to the ""Limbo"" review ...REVIEW 4 : Realism in Deception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""Wow ... this movie has a really strange power, it leaves me ecstatic when it finishes, and then the more I think about it, the more I realize that the very aspect that made me love the film could've been handled in a better way and with a deeper characterization: less chase scenes and shootings, more imagination and by that, I mean more beautiful settings and creative plot devices ... This movie is a cinematic experience that makes you scratch your head and hold your breath, but does it deserve all the praise? I wonder how I fell for this one, but I think it's time to retract myself and admit my judgment mistake. Yes, the movie is a cinematic Rubik's cube, but I guess I forgot how I used to get quickly bored by this game. How did I change my mind ? ... I don't know ... thinking, reading, realizing, sharing views, using this mind ""Inception"" tried to twist ... A very creative film, I wish it will win all the Oscars previously mentioned, but beyond the creativity of the concept ... what did I enjoy? I guess only the concept, the rest was just ... all flash and no substance"" 6/10Yep, the rating also fell through 4 ""layers"" ... what a painful awakening, this movie amazed me so much, I couldn't feel anything negative about it ... and one thing for sure, ""Inception"" has the weirdest power of attraction when you watch it for the first time, that's why I understand its popularity. It's like my mind had already accepted the idea that the movie would be a masterpiece just because it relied on a particularly innovative concept. Or was I just victim of an ""Inception"" called Marketing?"
23551,False,I thought this was suppose to be a great movie? I am not about to sit around for longer than 45 minutes jumping from scene to scene trying to decipher what the hell the movie is about - when a movie should be telling me the story. This was awful. How is the world does this movie have a high rating? Who is rating this film. We turned this movie OFF after 45 Minutes for a reason - it was that bad. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME! If people on these websites don't start voting realistically the movie industry will think this is what you like to see - and will keep making these crap movies. Just because a high profile actor is in the film does not warrant it to be spectacular. This is the second crap film from Leo in a row.
23552,False,"I felt like I'm wasting my time with this movie, really. All of its plot is based on very simple idea, yet this simple idea fails to convince me that it's somehow possible in real world or necessary for heroes to accomplish or this movie is supposed to teach me something or relay the message. Come on, I was on the edge of my seat when I was watching The Matrix going WOW several times and I was never disappointed and what a simple yet powerful message this was! With Inception I felt like watching The Prison Break series episode 10050. The movie provides absolutely no answers why I should bother to worry if they deliver the thought to the poor sob's head which they drugged on the plane. I simply don't care if they succeed or not. No immersion. In general words, special effects were good, street/bridge bending animations were good, yet I was bored the whole time. 6 out of 10 for this pointless flick which I forget in few weeks."
23553,False,"Watch South Park's take on this...It looks nice, but it is totally incoherent. Just a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing. Music used to manipulate, not enhance. I am going to fill the rest of this review with words because I am required to do so by the site. This review will perfectly mirror the movie as a result, because after the first two lines there is absolutely, positively, without question not an angstrom of a reason for you to continue reading. It's just that I hate this movie so much that I am willing to waste my time typing like this so as to bring the ratings down even in this sadly microscopic way since it is overwhelmingly loved for reasons that are just simply beyond my small little mind. Are we at ten lines yet? Whew."
23554,False,"As a true science fiction fan and a big fan of Memento, I was really looking forward to a mind-bending science fiction classic.You can't get much more of a creative license than have dreams and dream manipulation as the main subject matter. Any Director worth his salt should be able to really put on something special and I was expecting something spectacular from Christopher Nolan.Calling Inception an anti-climax would be an understatement. It was an utter and complete let-down. The special effects looked more suited to a music video, the character development was non-existent, the plot was simple and one-dimensional and once the movie ended the only thing that I was struggling to figure out was how on earth could so many people be so gullible.What a missed opportunity.If you're really looking for something mind bending that deals with dream states, dream manipulation and altered states of consciousness, try watching the superb 2009 6 part mini-series 'The Prisoner'."
23555,False,"The visuals in the first third of the movie are stunning. But then the story gets in the way. The multi-layered experience of the characters is so spoiled by all the crashes, shooting, and gratuitous action/violence. DiCaprio is doing a lot of weird stuff these days. See Shutter Island, for example. And he is better than this. I think this movie was made for adolescent boys. In the screening I saw they made up 2/3 of the audience. And they loved it. But I didn't hear any girls or women praising it. Altogether the cast was very good but they had little to do except go with the narrative. And it's a poor narrative. Boo."
23556,False,"I mean that figuratively and literally. First because this film doesn't deserve being that much praised (#3 best movie??!! - Matrix was way better, for example), second because, just as the unwatchable The Dark Knight, Nolan loves to have his movie filled with irritatingly loud rumbling noise throughout, even in romantic/dramatic scenes! Why? Is that to cover up the lack of real cinematic value and sustain the artificial climax? Over such a long movie, you wanna kill yourself!Wait for the DVD/BluRay if only for the CG effects. Cause there's little else than that really. Probably the last time I go out to the movies."
23557,False,This is a bad film. It is really sad to see so many people work so hard to produce this thing. So fake so pretentious so arrogant so little. Well it is supposed to be an action movie and people love it because they just want to have fun for their buck. Don't get me wrong - I like action in movies but this is so superfluous and boring...
23558,False,"I still don't think this guy has melded his talent into a great movie...although I'm sure most will disagree. The closest he came in my opinion was ""The Prestige"". If he ever gets the emotional part of the movie to be the driving force....& gets his very bright ideas to seam together just right.....I think he could make a movie thats as unbelievably good as most folks think this one is.Lets see....who is the dreamer in this scene cut..are we at level 1,2, or limbo, or somewhere else? Which players are on sedatives & what kind of Kicks do they need to go to the level somebody thinks they should be at & should they be synchronized kicks with music and/or free falling, and/or feeling gravity, etc. ad infinitum. Cut to the mountain fortress snowmobile scene....I thought for sure a scene from a James Bond movie got cut in by mistake here...all the bad guys wearing the same uniforms & chasing the good guy(s)& setting the explosives & shooting bullets galore....I guess this was an action movie as well with the car chases and crashes & well, you know.This movie could very easily be summed up as a dream somebody had....somebody that you never see in the movie...just somebody's dream. And some people think it was that.You have to give Nolan credit for a lot of his ideas, really good production values, and other movie making strengths. I thought it went way overboard with the complexity of who is the dreamer & who is sharing dreams with who & what level are they on & what are all the rules on that level, did they get into limbo & what is limbo exactly & do you really feel pain if you get shot in the leg...but if you get shot in the head you just wake up...or maybe go to double limbo if the architects totem is spinning, but maybe it's the dreamers totem, but if it's Cobbs totem & he got it from Mal it really doesn't work for him anyway. You could go on & on about this...but I guess you get my drift.I think Nolan has has the talent to make a great movie...but I think it will have to get people in their emotional core & I don't think he has done that yet. I liked ""The Dark Knight"" when ""The Joker"" character was in the scenes...too bad about Ledger...he was really showing some acting chops big time.I probably would have thought this movie was a lot better when I was much younger."
23559,False,"As someone who has explored hypnotism in depth, the concepts behind Inception were relatively easy to comprehend, and I enjoyed the novel idea of dreams within dreams within dreams. But the plot does seem to get caught up trying to be too clever with the prologue and epilogue, and I would agree with some critics who accuse it of almost collapsing in on itself. I think it just manages to keep interest, but that may be solely because I have experienced very deep trances in hypnosis, and understood the ideas suggested by the film.Visually the film uses rather interesting spectacle to show how dreams may collapse in on themselves, and tries to keep you guessing as to who is attempting what. It is, at times, stunning to watch. But overall the film fails to develop an interesting idea to the maximum.The acting is reasonable rather than good.Not in the same league as Minority Support (for example) but reasonable sci-fi."
23560,False,"I had waited to see this movie on a decent copy DVD and missed it at the cinema. It was a very hyped movie on its release and I like De Caprios movies on the whole including the recent Shutter Island which surely does have some psychological connection with this movie in'playing with our minds'. But I liked and followed Shutter Island, I couldn't really follow 'Inception' and as a native Englishman, I am still unsure as to the meaning of the word 'Inception' for the context of the film.The film is only mildly engaging, tries to be intelligent and smart but fails dismally. There is no lack of action but this is 'not' Bourne Supremacy' or 'Salt' and things happened so haphazardly and quickly in the actions scenes that it completely bored the pants off me when watching the movie because I was trying to follow the story of the film and couldn't, so I became frustrated.Leonardo is a great actor and acts well, true enough and I love Ellen Page after Juno and even Peacock - but this film was definitely not for her and Michael Caine had a minor cameo role as Miles the Father figure for Leonardos character. As for Mal played by Marion Couthillard, oh dear, what a shambles! This is one of those films which will be quickly forgotten and barely remembered in Leonardos repertoire. The concept of the film is indeed a good and innovative one and I kept thinking of movies like 'The Matrix' while watching it. Why oh why did the director have to 'overcook' this movie.We watch movies to be entertained. Like Iron Man 2, if you like movies with abundant action and little reality, go ahead, watch this movie and rave about it but for me, it is a major disappointment, not with the mainstream acting and the story but with the end result through directing and production. My feeling is that it was shoddy.Not a movie to review a second time or recommend to friends to see, sorry!"
23561,False,"I voted this 1 out of 10, (not because it deserves it, it's probably a 4 or 5 to be fair), but because I wanted to protest at this rising to number 3 in the top 250 of all time. YOU MUST BE JOKING, RIGHT? This is a better film than Pulp Fiction? The usual suspects? The good, the bad and the ugly? One flew over the cuckoo's nest? Bladerunner? Have these people even seen those films? Do they honestly place these films below this Emperor's new clothes? Character development? Virtually nil. Suspense? Not much. Plot, OK, but I really didn't care about most of these people at the end. Visually interesting in parts, at least! I won't be buying this on DVD - one viewing was more than enough for me! See it by all means, but, DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!"
23562,False,"Q: I didn't really understand the whole movie and I fell like the only one who didn't understandA: watch it again and pay attention. it helps. Q: I did pay attention and still didn't get it maybe I missed somethingA: Read through the entire FAQ section of IMDb for the movie.---I rest my case (the above is a word-for-word excerpt from the film's IMDb message board - in case you were wondering).Possibly something like 90% of what is posted about Nolan's movies in the IMDb forum are obvious and desperate fanboys' attempts at explaining what each movie was really all about.They go to great lengths in trying to reason everyone why what seemed like plot holes weren't actually plot holes at all. Or what seemed like bad writing, directing, acting etc., was actually outstanding. It's like an engineer telling us when we complain about a p.o.s. technical gadget we just bought not working the way it's supposed to that it is actually quite easy to use: ""Here let me show you. First you press here. Then you open the menu. No, not that menu, the other menu. Then you"" ad infinitum. If we didn't care about the characters, if we didn't care about the plot, if we didn't care about the visuals, then why would anyone with a half a brain expect anyone to suddenly view the same movie as a master piece by that one notion alone that it could have technically worked?Might these be the same guys (they are always guys, you see) who lament that their girlfriends - if they indeed have one - either can't or refuse to have an orgasm even though they themselves are technically doing everything right?Four words, homies. We. Do. Not. Care."
23563,False,"Have you ever read the story about the Emperor's new clothes? It's about two weavers who promise an Emperor a new suit of clothes that is invisible to those unfit for their position, stupid, or incompetent. When the Emperor parades before his subjects in his new clothes, a child cries out, ""But he isn't wearing anything at all!""A dream within a dream within a dream with Cobb's (played by DiCraprio) wife as an intruder in his subconsciousness, and if something goes terribly wrong you enter the state of Limbo where you're stuck in one's raw subconsciousness. Sounds really deep and complicated, right? It really isn't. The plot of this movie may as well be a new metaphor for those clothes that nobody could see. There isn't a deep philosophical meaning behind it. It's just made sound complicated enough for the viewer to be expected to draw a philosophical meaning and ""understand"" it. The viewer who is able to do that is ""smart enough"".People pretend to extract some philosophical meaning out of it and therefore continue praising it. They do not want to be the ""stupid ones"". The truth is, it is only an OK action movie, it has good fighting scenes and good acting, but is too long for its own good. It's time for people to admit that the Emperor is really naked."
23564,False,"This movie seems to be Matrix with a cheap twist. There was too much effort trying to make the movie ""complex"" and less on trying to build a plot. I find that people love this movie because it has the false appearance of one that is confusing when in reality it is fairly easy to follow. People tend to like the pseudo-intelligent boost in being able to follow a simple movie with the false appearance of being complex.Southpark put it best in their take on it*:Sharon: Just because an idea is over convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool. Going into multiple dream levels sounds like a really stupid idea. Cobb: You don't get it because you're not smart enough.*(Season 14 Episode 10 - Insheepsion)"
23565,False,"2.5 hours of my life wasted watching this drivel. Sorry for fans of this film but I thought it was garbage. I don't like dream stories, might as well be about wizards, anything can happen, there's no reality. I don't like slo mo stuff or flying through the air. And why 2 actors as prime characters who look like children? I'm referring to Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I like them both as actors but they are supposed to be a crack team of experts, hard to believe when 2 of them look about 14 years old. They'd be great in a stoner movie or something, not in something that's meant to be serious. One of them perhaps, but both, no."
23566,False,"Okay, maybe this movie isn't awful. It's closer to mediocre, but I just can't resist the urge to lower its over-inflated rating.To be fair, Inception has a strong cast, inventive CGI, and an interesting premise. Nonetheless, the film ends up being surprisingly tedious and unaffecting. Images rush across the screen as jargon-rich dialogue whisks pasts your ears. The film's methodical score swells and swells until you can barely make out what the characters are saying. It's all so complex, but complex like a brainteaser or a riddle. If you concentrate very hard, you can decode the film's narrative trick of dreams within dreams within dreams within, well you get the idea, and multiple action sequences all taking place at once in parallel dreamscapes.But, what do you get for all of your narrative attention? Very little. The story is gimmicky and the characters are flat: you just don't care what happens to them. In fact, when watching this film, I did not feel as if I were watching characters navigate a story world. Instead, I felt like I was watching movie stars speak difficult dialogue while performing stunts.By the way, any movie that can make Joseph Gordon-Levitt seem less than fascinating must have something wrong with it. If you do not believe me, then watch Manic, Mysterious Skin, or The Lookout. Then marvel at Inception's ability to mask or at the very least waste his considerable talent.As for the movie's imagery, it is initially striking. Then, like the movie's narrative trope a dream within a dream within a dream it becomes simply repetitious. Whose dreams look so leaden and dull? And whose dreams are so relentlessly consistent and coherent? There are so many good movies that replicate the bizarre visual logic of dreams-- Vertigo, Badlands, The Last Wave, Videodrome, Blue Velvet, Until the End of the World. Has director Christopher Nolan ever seen any of these movies? Has he ever even had a dream? In short, Inception delivers some new cinematic tricks, but lacks emotional depth or provocative imagery. It's a notch above Hollywood's typical comic book based summer extravaganza, but only a notch."
23567,False,"I will rate this movie on characters/script, acting, plot, production and an x-factor. The characters in this movie have no personality or depth. Worse, because you cannot sympathise with them in any way, they add a clichéd sob story for the main character, to fill the gap left by a clinical inability to project any humanity onto him, through the use of dialogue. Score = 1/10. The acting is OK. Average. But with no characters to act, I would imagine this isn't hard. Score = 3/10. The plot is complicated (for a movie), fast paced and based on the most spurious, simplistic and quasi-scientific description of the human mind. It demands that you concentrate to keep up, so it is very disappointing to realise that your efforts are unrewarded. There are logical, philosophical, scientific and psychological flaws with every turn of the plot, and it isn't even consistent in these. This makes it a very boring movie to watch so a big fat 1/10 for plot. Production is good. Nice special effects with a big budget. 7/10. So far we have 12/40, which is 3/10. This means I would have to give -7/10 for x-factor, in order to arrive at a final score of 1/10, which is what this movie deserves, because it claims to be so much that it is not. So x-factor gets -7/10 exactly."
23568,False,"WAY OVERRATED! Makes you wonder if IMDb should re-think their ranking formula. I'd say Inception deserves a 6 or 7. But to be the #6 movie of all-time, you need character development. There was none. Zero, zip, nada. We're told that here's Leonardo, and here's an Asian guy who wants him to go into a dream, and that's it. Boom, now start the action. I will say that the concept was very good. It could have been a great movie if they would have left in some action, but cut out about 45 minutes of it and substituted character and dream-sequences/plot, rather than just wild chases/shoot-outs. During these parts I found myself very bored."
23569,False,"Intriguing premise and interesting early scenes, but bored me to death during the second half of the movie, which in essence was just a ""C"" or ""D"" super-action movie which, ""aww shucks,"" just happens to take place inside someone's dream-world. Especially tiresome were the battles with endless ski-troopers inside the subject's ""militarized mind."" Utterly pointless. I was so bored that I didn't even care to think about the movie's completely predictable attempt at a thought provoking twist. I just didn't want to waste a single second more of my time in the ironically unimaginative mind of the movie's creator.Very boring and anticlimactic. Not even worth the time spend watching it IMO. The 5 stars are given largely for the initially interesting cinematography"
23570,False,"OK, Inception can be the best rated movie of 2010, but not for me. I'm not questioning its quality as an action movie but yes as a sci-fi production because after The Matrix this movie seems much more illogical exactly for trying to be more realistic and fully coherent and cohesive. Also, it's impossible not compare it to The Matrix as Christopher Nolan already stated that the idea for the movie came from movies like The Matrix, The 13th Floor and The Dark City. That's so inspired by these movies - mainly The Matrix - that some references to it are a lot clear: the red and blue button in the briefcase (like the red and blue pill), the architect, a group which each one of them has an specific ability, the idea (meaning the virus), the dream soldiers (as the anti-virus), the totem (like the telephone), among others...Who pays attention to dreams or is familiar to the basics of it knows that the movie is right in some points but lacks of several other characteristics. When you're in a lucid dream you're able to control it and direct events and happenings, that's why you're able do dream a lucid dream and back to it even if you wake up for a short time. In unconscious dream you're unable to control it, that's why we mostly wake up when we die or when we fall, because in a lucid dream you're able to 'defend' yourself as you wish. The world of unconscious dream, where most of the film tries to reproduce as the characters are in a pre-coma state, is a lot more confusing and chaotic than it seems. It could have been much more explored if wasn't given so much attention for action sequences. The only time where seems like a real and chaotic dream is when a train crosses an entire street. At that moment I thought that things would be visually interesting, but it never was.Trying to give more attention for the action and not for science, the characters have a magic pack that connects several people into a dreamer's dream without reason. In The Matrix they have those huge machines that are connected in their minds to fully transfer people to a dream world previously built, making 2 or more people share the same dream space. That makes The Matrix more acceptable in this explanation than Inception. Scientists believe that sharing a dream is possible as the brain is moved by electric impulses, so, if we have a main board able to unify and decode those electric impulses, this could be possible. But in Inception what really connects them all? Just a powerful sedative? Are they super heroes or what? That's why I think that The Matrix is much more successful when exploring this idea, because it starts from a solid scientific one.While The Matrix deals with an electronic generated world, in Inception we are talking about a dream where there are cities, people, mobiles that works, explosives, car crashing, people dying and bleeding and whatever... but never the power of imagination. Work about the inception of an idea is a great plot, and the barriers for that could be anything than just a bunch of armored guys shooting and exploding everything.Inception for me is just a redone idea, the same as Avatar is to Pochahontas, but Inception doesn't give me anything new or add something interesting among other interesting ones I've seen before. The media calls it one of the best movies of 2010 and one of the best sci-fi movies of the time and that actually insults my intelligence because there's nothing new there. But the industry needs to make money from something times to times and they found Inception a great money machine. Technically the movie is superb and a great action flick, but I don't see anything more from it.I give 5 stars just as an action movie, because thinking as a sci-fi, I give it none. There's a lot for nothing... or maybe, a lot for just in the end the movie explains that incept an idea is so difficult as I trying to convince you that this movie isn't so good as it seems."
23571,False,"..is wrong with you people? It seems that most ""smart"" viewers were so busy trying to keep up with the stupid plot that they had no mental energy left for common sense, taste or critical thinking. The experience became unbearable as soon as the first action scene of the lets-plant-the-idea-mission began.As an odd coincidence my nose started running at the same time - heavily and nonstop. Having no handkerchiefs with me I had to wipe it barehanded until the end of the movie! This in a theater full of poor people like me also misled by the hype.It was probably my immune system trying its best to make me leave the seat."
23572,False,"This movie spends far, far too much time telling instead of showing. The actors have to deal with so much exposition, the strain and boredom is practically palpable. Dialogue this obviously for the audience's benefit and this inorganic is completely undeliverable. It's not nearly so complicated that this level of explication is necessary, either.The biggest problem, however, is that this is not a sci-fi film or a thoughtful drama or the incredibly rare gem of a film that transcends any kind of genre that it wants to be. It's an action spectacle and that's all. It's not deep and the characters are issues with name-tags. The massive, driving climax full of supposed suspense left me unmoved and thinking about other things because I really didn't care about these thinly drawn stick figures. Additionally, the thinks-it's-very-clever ending was the cheapest trick in the book and it cheats at its own game.People comparing this to The Matrix (a film that really does rise above its genre and its spectacle, where even the minor characters feel fleshed out) aren't doing it any favours."
23573,False,"Inception is the most powerful work of art created in our time. Nolan is a worthy successor to Freud. It would take a lifetime to describe in words, the heights that it reaches and the depths that it achieves. Cinema is no longer limited by the size of the screen. Inception is augmented reality. 3D without them glasses, Finally!I have never seen a movie like Inception and trust me, neither have you. Memento was only a teaser. Nolan is a master of the mind. Inception is a hypnosis, that creates mind orgasms.I happened to be one of the lucky few to catch a late night preview showing. And boy did I have to struggle for that invite. But things fell into place, and I got in, only to realize that this film isn't about you getting into the theater, to watch it, Inception gets into you. Your mind is really the scene of crime."
23574,False,"I just saw inception last night and absolutely loved it. Everything is top-notch. Most of all, like in every Nolan movie, the editing is crisp. There is no room for even a smile. Action is unique and highly entertaining; although make a note there is no adrenaline rush during any action scenes. This is where Nolan's problem lies. We would have experienced that missing adrenaline rush if he had taken some time to develop the supporting characters, in order to make us feel for them. The only characters I felt for is Cobb and Mal. Their love for each other is shown beautifully, I personally have never seen a relationship explored in this unique way. The only reason I can think why Nolan didn't spend time on other characters is because of the plot he had to first explain and then execute. The plot is hard to explain let alone execute, Nolan did a very good job given the short amount of time. At the same time he had to make sure he did not loose the audience in confusion. A job well done. Now, what I really like about this movie, is the IDEA. Nolan has this great idea for a movie about dreams. On the surface the movie is loaded with multiple tense narratives, but in the background he's also exploring how powerful the medium of dream can be. Also at the same time he maintains the through-line of the movie. Not letting anyone forget why we are watching this movie, why we should care the protagonist reaches to a conclusion. Without the strong through-line we would be lost like in dreams. I think the best actor in the movie is Marian Cotillard. She plays her part with such a beauty I just can't describe. Leonardo also convinces us to fall for his motivations and makes us want him to accomplish his mission. Joseph Gordon-Lewitt also plays his part brilliantly, he is very straight forward unlike the earlier mentioned actors. The rest of the actors are just fine. Everyone Needs to see this movie if not because it is the best Sci-Fi movie after Matrix, then for the fact that it is the best movie of the year. If only Nolan can make a movie with this tight narrative and make us fall for the characters at the same time; your heart will stop beating. 10/10"
23575,False,"Of course, I had heard lots about this movie and actually love track #12 from the OST (by Zimmer), but I'd never made an effort to go watch it. Something in my mind told me it wouldn't be worth it. Besides, I'm not much impressed by DiCaprio's acting skills.Still, after a long while I wanted to see what the fuss is about. I am checking out numerous films people recommend as 'best of 2010' to me.Inception was waaaaay too shallow for me. It's a superficial action film that admittedly looks visually nice, but there's no real drama. It actually bored me. Left me cold.If you want to see a 2010 film including DiCaprio, go see Shutter Island. Much, much better, but not great, which is too bad.Anyway, I don't want to spend too many words on this Inception creation. Yawn."
23576,False,"This film has great effects. That is about all I can say because I found its plot instantly forgettable. Slickly directed, it is a visual treat.Leonardo D. is solid as usual, Ellen Page is good but she suffers from looking too young to have qualified as an architect.I would struggle to think of any reason to recommend this film to anyone to watch because beyond the sight of Paris folding over there is nothing else to recommend. Not enough tension within the plot so I didn't actually care about the characters.Looks good but not a great film."
23577,False,"I'm really tired of American movies ripping off foreign films, specifically animes. The Matrix did it with Ghost in the Shell. Now Inception does it with Paprika.I went into this having already seen Paprika, which I thought had a MUCH better story. Because of this I just couldn't see how ""complex"" and ""amazing"" it was. The story is about a thief who can travel through dreams. Inception is the idea of changing someones decisions based on infiltrating their dreams and affecting their subconscious. The acting is not bad, a bit predictable though in the Hollywood sense...Overall, it was a decently executed rip-off, but nothing spectacular. It's a shame that the original Paprika never got even half the attention of this subpar version."
23578,False,"Inception. Terrible movie. Huge waste of time. Dark scenes and mumbling actors made it hard to follow. Concept pretty far-fetched making it even harder to understand. At times I thought it would be better as a comedy, instead of the dark, twisted story it was. I've never done drugs, but this probably came close to an hallucinogenic experience. I'm still not sure what happened in the movie. How did I not fall asleep during this one?While most movie-goers don't really want to think about what's going on, that's all one could do during this stinker. Constantly thinking about what was happening; why it was happening; what did it mean; what did they say; who are all these people; what the heck is going on? About an hour into it I thought for sure I'd fall asleep, but Inception gave me such a huge headache, sleep was impossible.Inception may have been about dreams, but for me it was just a bad nightmare!"
23579,False,"Not far into this film I thought it wasn't for me but my husband will like it. But after enduring more than half of it I realised that was an insult to his intelligence.Utterly boring and confused (rather than confusing) with pointless violence just for the sake of it. Will no doubt make a decent computer game.I am giving this 3 purely for the special effects, which are OK.If I never I see another film like this it will be too soon.I have never reviewed a movie on here before but I felt I must as that 9.2 rating has to change!"
23580,False,"I'm going to keep this short the movie was over hyped, I enjoy Nolans movie Memento, he really took a complex idea and made it work.In this movie the idea fails and seems to mimic and follow the lines of Matrix, although I feel Matrix had a better atmosphere, style, and creativity.Although this is not a bad movie, but in my opinion it is not worth a nomination for best picture, or the great reviews people are giving this movie.I loved the soundtrack, and the CGI was really top notch in this movie, what I didn't enjoy was how the dreams were perceived and were fleshed out they didn't seem like dreams and they couldn't control them like you would your dreams it was more like a computer world, or alternate reality/parallel universe.The story was also over complicated with subplots that took you away from the film. I felt like this movie was stuck in mud and the only way to break it up was to but some intense action sequences, which made it seem to much like the matrix.I will not say I hated this movie, but did not enjoy it the way I thought I would. I love dream/reality movies it my favorite topic it just seems like this movie went to close to the matrix instead of making a thought provoking movie about dreams/reality and what is real what is not..."
23581,False,"I couldn't wait to watch this film but boy was it disappointing. It was a fantastic idea and yes it looked great. However, the main problem for me was that the characters were drawn so poorly in conjunction with the visuals that I did not really care what happened to them. I loved Momento and The Dark Knight but the crucial difference is that I cared about Guy Pearce and Christian Bale. It may be perhaps that I do not rate De Caprio but I could care less about what his predicament was. I even tried watching it 3 times to see if I was missing anything but ended up getting annoyed. Visually stunning there is no doubt and an amazing concept but emotionally shallow."
23582,False,"First, let me say that ALL the Actors, but one, were fantastic, and the one that wasn't, had a language/enunciation problem. (half the time he spoke you couldn't understand what he said) But good actors (and believe me they did their damnedest!)can't make up for a wandering script with poor suspension of disbelief. Just when something needed expounding or explanation, the script would jump to a different scenario. And the sound! I guess the editor thinks that when you push the volume, no-one will notice how the villains (the ""projections"") have no identity (individually OR in groups) for the audience to hate (OR love.) So loud during the bombings and shoot-'em-ups, I had to plug in my ear- buds. This movie could have been the best of the year with INTELLIGENT rewriting, editing, and minus the actor with questionable language skills. Instead, it was nonsense. I can not believe IMDb's 9.2/10 rating. I smell a rat. I guess if Congressmen and Senators take bribes, why not IMDb ""payola""!"
23583,False,"Let me begin by saying that Inception is not bad, but it certainly isn't great. Nolan's script fails in multiple areas that harm the film significantly.1. The characterization is mediocre. Most of the members of the team are one-note, shallow and uninteresting. This greatly hampers your emotional attachment to the film and prevents you from caring about the outcome. Compared to the intense and complex characters of The Prestige, Insomnia, and Memento, the cast of Inception appears to be mostly slick suits walking around and doing things.2. The grandiose themes and interesting concepts that existed in The Dark Knight or Batman Begins are nowhere to be found here. Terrorism, corruption, or duty are ignored for love (which is dealt with in some of the most trite dialogue ever).3. The plot is too twisty for it's own good, resulting in you appreciating it less as a film and more as a puzzle. Vaguity does not equal genius, contrary to many critic's beliefs.In conclusion, Inception is a visually stunning film with aspirations at being significant, but it fails. Is it a thoughtful blockbuster? Yes. Is it the worst film Nolan has ever made? Absolutely. Should you watch it? Yes."
23584,False,"It may be just my preference, but I don't care for films that seem to start in the third act and never seem to leave it.I usually like the films of DiCaprio. I think he's a convincing actor. And I do appreciate the production values. But I found the constant, ominous background music cloying at times. This film is hard to get into at first, and unfortunately doesn't get any easier as time goes on. Unlike most films that seem to start at the end, then the remaining film is spent retroactively, filling in how everyone got there, this film just continues to twist the viewer around without mercy. Sorry, but I like to relax when I watch a movie.I realize, the dream scape can be ambiguous, but I would have rather spent this 2.5 hours weaving my own, eyes closed, in bed. Z Z Z Z"
23585,False,"I loved some of Nolan's other films. I really loved Memento, Insomnia, The Prestige. I liked The Dark Knight.During Inception I kept checking my watch. I was trying to decide whether I checked my watch (as in, ""are we there yet?"") more times during a recent, torturous, 9-hour transatlantic flight or during this 2 hour 20 minute movie.I think as a 90 minute movie this would have been fun and entertaining. Nothing too special but it would have been a fine entertaining movie. I don't get what all the fuss is about.It's like a high-priced CGI-laden attempt at a Philip K Dick novel but a little overwrought."
23586,False,"Where should I start? It would be better to get straight to the point. Firstly, despite the idea is brilliant, in other words, generally the story of the movie is brilliant, ideas don't make a movie great as just complicatedness doesn't make a movie good. By this movie, personally, I have understood that Nolan is not ""my director"". The Dark Knight was also a serious disappointment for me and Batman Begins was just a summer blockbuster (Following and Prestige were very very good) As for Inception, the biggest flaw of the movie is the movie is lack of heart and soul, in other words, it is cold. The characters are cold, the atmosphere is cold, the reactions are cold, because they are in dream? Well, I don't think so. It causes what then? I didn't much care about the intrigue, couldn't identify with the characters, so the most important problem of the movie is its dramatic structure. The second is the ""dreams"" itself. You know, the agent of dreams in cinema is David Lynch. Why? Because he shoots creative, intriguing, sometimes meaningless as it should be and surreal dream sequences. The dream sequences in Inception can only impress the architects, mathematicians and some businessmen (because there are a lot of men in black suit) It is because like his approach towards Batman, he sticks to reality. Despite the visual effects are jaw dropping, ""the street bending"" scene is my favorite, it doesn't help much. By the way, honestly, I couldn't understand the trick of Ariadne, for example, is it planned or impromptu? If the point is impressiveness, well I was much more impressed by Sucker Punch for example which has been exposed to harsh reviews. The movie also has not any dramatic twist, epic scene (except for a few moments) or real mystery which had been all necessary in my opinion. Can we say that the movie was low key? Thirdly, some, may be many action scenes seem pointless and ineffective. Especially the ""snow"" sequence. It was too long without real entertainment or excitement. There is not any problem with the cast (except the fact that in contrast with the majority, I think that Leonardo Di Caprio's performance in this movie was just good, not his best performance so far, it is nothing, for example in comparison with What's eating Gilbert Grape!), but it is a bit disappointing that Nolan often uses the same actors in his movies. A note: Michael Caine's character might be a tribute for his character in Children of Men. If you ask me, the best part of the movie is the ""train scene"" It was the only scene that I was dramatically involved and got excited. The ""gravity"" sequence was just interesting. I didn't find it epic. Finally, about the plot, I didn't find the starting point creative, brilliant or exciting. I mean the concept of choosing a businessman for inception, weren't there better options? In other words, the main story was too poor for the concept. However, if we consider Nolan's style, to tell a story about the world of business, might be exciting for him. However, if we consider the hype, the rating, the reviews etc. it seems that Mr. Nolan has deluded audiences again or we have been incepted."
23587,False,"Inception is the first movie nominated for Best Picture that I hated on. It's not all that.My biggest problem was that they couldn't get me to care about the relationship between Leonardo DiCaprio, his wife and his child, which was suppose to be Dom Cobb(DiCaprio character) biggest motivation. I could care less for any of the characters, I wasn't emotionally invested at all.This isn't the first time Christopher Nolan tried to take Film Art concepts and commercialize it. This is an attempt at making a surrealism commercial. The problem with trying to make a surreal movie for the general public is that you have to make it understandable to the masses. The dreams in the movie was too orderly. Surrealist films like, Un Chien Andalou, are chaotic like dreams.Big visuals and action sequences aren't enough anymore, if you can't get me care about what drives the story, you're going to lose me."
23588,False,"Inception is a film that thinks it's too clever by half and then sets about insulting its audience by presuming they have no brain. No amount of pseudo-intelligence, rubbish dialogue and overuse of special effects can redeem this pile of junk. An inferior video game masquerading as high art.Christopher Nolan thinks he is a great director by basing his story on Freudian assumptions and psycho-babble but the dialogue is incomprehensible and the use of A-listers to carry the film shows that they are far more interested in making money than utilising their acting skills."
23589,False,"I'd Like to start by saying that I am a big fan of Christopher Nolan, I loved The Dark Knight And Memento, but I am afraid that this film dropped well below my expectations.This film is filled to the brim with special effects but lacks the substance.If you pay enough attention to follow this car crash of a storyline by the end you'll wished you hadn't bothered.The only thing that saves this film is the acting performances and the special effects, which at times can even make you dizzy. So I am afraid this film is an absolute, catastrophic and undoubtedly definite disappointment. Do yourself a favour and watch something else."
23590,False,"First, let me say that the acting was good, and that Leonardo DiCaprio is a good actor. The bad rating I gave this movie has nothing to do with the actors' performances.I gave this a bad rating because the writing was just bad. The CONCEPT of the movie was excellent. When I first saw the trailer, my imagination went wild. The scope of where you could go and what you could do with a concept like inception in people's dreams is almost endless.But, where did they run with it? Guns? Explosions? Grand Theft Auto? Matrix wannabe? These are the words that came to mind when I watched this.And the plot, if that's what you call it, is nothing. It's convoluted minus the imagination, mystery, and intelligence. It's like they made it complicated so it could SEEM intelligent. But trust me, it's not! About 1/2 to 2/3 into the movie, the ending became VERY predictable. Even so, I thought, ""It's about the journey not the ending. Right?"" Except the journey sucked. How come everybody in this movie only dreams about automatic weapons? I know, I know. There are a bunch of explanations in the movie, but the explanations are terrible and not thorough enough to be believable. For example, the characters explain the assault weapons in the dreams by saying the subconscious had been militarized.What kind of stupid explanation is that? Am I supposed to take that seriously? It seems like the movie is just asking for an excuse to become a pseudo-Matrix action flick. Except the Matrix was much better than this.Well... What a waste of a good concept... but mindless action flicks can be fun, even when they continuously, pretentiously claim to be thought-provoking..... But then there's the looooong drawn out mushy ending that breaks up the action and isn't befitting an action flick at all.So, congratulations Hollywood. You managed to take a good concept of a movie with a great cast, remove all imagination and intelligence, while simultaneously turning it into a mediocre action flick with a terrible ending.Hollywood fails again... 4/10 stars"
23591,False,"i will start off by saying that I'm not a fan of DiCaprio's work,but that is not the reason why i didn't like this movie.the special effects are spot on but i just didn't like the idea of the script, the acting was almost lazy and forced,it seems to me that maybe DiCaprio is getting worse with age (much like brad Pitt).of course when i viewed this with a few mates they all loved it but i was left with a headache.the script was all over the place and it was a little too confusing and hard to keep track of. this was named as one of the best movies of 2010 but i saw way better animated movie that year. do yourself a favour and save your money and time."
23592,False,I had this film sitting around on my hard drive for a good 6 months and never got round to watching it. But after seeing the high score this film has on IMDb I thought it was about time I took a look at this 'masterpiece'. I started watching the film back in January and managed to handle around 30 minutes before my interest started to wain. After another few weeks I finally had a second attempt at watching the whole film and I have to say I think I need a commendation for sitting through this convoluted mess all the way to the end. How this film has ended up at No.8 in the all time Top 250 I have absolutely no idea; all I can think of is nowadays very good special effects constitute this film as a classic as opposed to acting and storyline??? Perhaps they're are too many sheep on the planet nowadays....this would account for the ridiculous 8th best film of all time ranking.
23593,False,"Don't believe the hype on this one. Its not a bad movie and has some interesting ideas. But its not the birth of a new religion - as some would have it. How this is mentioned in the same sentence as the 'Kings Speech' is beyond me.In general Im delighted to see any attempt to muck around with the usual narrative sequence or which mixes dream with reality. Mememto was a staggering film and I loved the Matrix 1.But after some early promise of mind altering visuals - the majority of the film was played out in what were disappointingly normal landscapes. They reminded me of conventional bond movie sets than anything else. Where was the Escher stair case? Where was the warping of physics? I felt a little let down to be honest. It was only when we reached level four that I became a little more engaged and impressed.The story line itself I felt badly cluttered with too many explanations of the mechanics of invading dreams. It was nearly always noisy and the dialogue often muffled. This made it hard to follow - (and yes, my hearing is fine and I have a state of the art Theatre system) But the really disappointing thing was that with a concept as subtle as invading peoples dreams and planting new ideas - we had to have gun fights all over the place. Frankly the crassness of the shoot outs clashed rather awkwardly with some intelligent ideas about the nature of reality. And why did all the baddies have 'A-team' shooting accuracy? Last point - wouldn't it have been rather easier to persuade the target to do what they needed him to - through non-dream means?"
23594,False,"yes, it's brilliant! the cinematic effect was outstanding! but what is the real essence of the story? what is the core idea? simple: stealing ideas or implanting one through the dream state. that's it.i felt so dumb while i'm watching this movie. there are so many questions left in my mind after. a good movie does not do that to audiences. it can be complex, it can be convoluted, but in the end the viewers should have a grip on it. at first, i was astounded by the very idea of the story but as i reflected on it i realized that the only thing the film successfully did is obscure the brilliance of the core idea. a good movie communicates with its audience. inception only blurred the communication lines."
23595,False,"What a load of rubbish, you gotta love the way everyone gets real excited about a film that doesn't make any sense, hey, i don't get it, oh, so it must be an intelligent movie! People, movies are not intelligent, they are there for entertainment, and this one was just plain stupid, basically tripping over itself trying to be cleverer then it was supposed to be. Any intelligent human being who stops and thinks about it for 2 minutes will realise that it doesn't make sense at the beginning, nor at the end, and all the thickoes like that! because if it doesn't make sense to them, then it must be clever, no guys! give yourselves more credit then that, it's a load of rubbish!"
23596,False,"There were only a handful of moments throughout ""Inception"" where I didn't feel like I was watching actors going through the motions of a plot too complex for them to keep track of during filming. I imagined the directorial staff telling them: ""Hey you, run over here, then turn around that way.....just do it, don't ask why right now!""I don't think DiCaprio was very well cast. He can be intense, but often comes off like a teenager posing as an adult. This role called for someone more eccentric with a mysterious presence. Likewise, the architect girl seemed like she belonged in high school, though she was nice to look at.The plot had a good premise but it barely got me involved psychologically. After the first hour or so, the layers of complexity got ahead of themselves and erased any real feeling of suspense. You need a decent grasp of what's actually going on to feel suspense. Due to the lack of focus, I found my eyes straying to things like the Joliesque bump on the wife's forehead, etc. A good film doesn't let the mind wander.After a point, this thing became so convoluted that I was trying to figure out how it was made (on a technical level) rather than putting serious effort into following the plot. Yes, I got the gist of the dream layers and the general plan, but the timing of the ""kicks"" became too hard to follow.I spent half my viewing time wondering why dreams, which in real life contain random absurdities, could be so precise, down to the timing of bombs. These dreams never seemed like ones I've experienced, so the main premise of the movie was ""kicked"" out the door early on. Technology- wise, it seems highly unlikely that people could share dreams except for random electrical pulses.Maybe it played better in a big theater with the crowd adding to the substantial hype that preceded it. I saw it at home on Blu-ray and it just didn't fire me up. I even considered turning it off twice, but the very end was clever enough to make it worth the slog."
23597,False,"I like Christopher Nolan. He a good director. His little movie here, Inception, is one of those movies that give you brain burn. Allow me to explain! A rag tag team of handsome thieves invade people's dreams and extract memories. But for some reason implanting ideas in someone's head is super hard? No it's not! Hypnotist do it all the time. Then this Arthur character says ""The dreamer can always remember the genesis of the idea. True inspiration is impossible to fake."" Also, not true. People get source amnesia all the time. I'm sure you've met someone who claims to have invented a joke or a phrase that they actually heard from someone else. And these thieves are trying to get some wealthy hot-shot to shut down his bidnass? There's an easier way to do that that doesn't involve dream invasion. Wallstreet does it all the time. If some butt-wipe is getting too powerful, just bust him for any number of egregious crimes in which super wealthy billionaires inevitably get themselves involved. Or frame him and arrange some kind of take-over. 10000000000 times easier. Additionally, there are plenty of cheesy Hollywood shootouts where the bad guys can't aim, and cars function perfectly fine after being filled with bullet holes. You could say the cars still work cuz it's a dream, but then why do shot up people get totally screwed? I can overlook these ridiculous elements in a Jean Claude Van Damme movie by simply turning off my brain, but that's exactly where everything goes wrong in this movie. Ya see, if this was a comedy, everything in the story would work. But it isn't a comedy, is it, homies? heck no, son, it's a psychological thriller! So it's meant to stimulate your brain, but all the absurdities mentioned above ask you turn your brain off in order to enjoy it. So the constant turning on and off chafes your brain. Brain burn."
23598,False,"IMDb 9/10 ROTTEN TOMATOES 8/10 METACRITIC 7.4/10 ALLMOVIE 4/5First of all, I must say this film is very overrated. It's over-average, but it isn't' great. It delivers some good and sometimes unbelievable (not always in a good sense) action, it has some interesting twists and performances are convincing enough, but that's about it. On the bad side, the film it's a bit too long, the characters aren't well developed and the end isn't very satisfactory.This film is a mix between Matrix (slow motion, different reality), Memento (present/past vs dreamworld/ real world and flashbacks) and James Bond (action).So, an entertaining movie with some interesting details but a somehow disappointing end."
23599,False,"The levels of boredom I reached during this film will take a fair while for me to forgive Christopher Nolan, the Director, for. A very simple idea has been taken and, just like my headphones do in my pocket, twisted and turned to leave me wondering how on earth they managed to get in this nonsensical situation. It's one saving grace, the CGI, has been used to try to endlessly distract the audience from the utter tripe being pass off as a story-line. I'm surprised that the distributors weren't legally obliged to provide the audience with an eye wash with their ticket, as the intense editing and camera movement left me, on several occasions, having to check my eyes weren't bleeding.Like The Matrix, it beggars belief that this film is being held up as some sort of future classic. Either I'm a genius, hovering in a state of advanced consciousness, or the people who loved this film are stoners or morons, unfortunately, for my ego, I suspect the later to be the reality.Save your money."
23600,False,"I like good sci fi movies. This is not a good one. The plot was predictable. There was nothing unexpected. There is constant violence at every dream level. Why does every dream have to be about running from an army of thoughtless killers or assaulting a heavily defended alpine military outpost for no apparent reason? The 'architect' has little direct and obvious impact. She really was just a counselor for the star, or just wanted to throw in a 'pretty face' for the obvious and demeaning task of window dressing. They should have had her kick some butt if they were going to have a 2 hour gun battle. The special effects were far from spectacular. The star cast is great and they did what they could with what little they were given. They could not overcome the weaknesses."
23601,False,"This is a tedious and boring movie that begs you to NOT suspend your disbelief and, instead, to wad up your popcorn bag and throw it at the screen. Okay, I exaggerate a little. But... Read the insightful reviews dated 19 July: You Don't Get It. And 20 July: Boring, Too Long, Awful Dialogue. And 21 July: Not Bad But Definitely Not Genius. And 29 July: Dumb, Dumb, Dumb. And finally, for a little fun, 23 July: Blah. Rather than rehash the insights of those helpful reviews, I'll try to add something useful...Inside of 30 minutes I was squirming in my seat, tapping my fingers, and checking my watch. Why? No character development. No sense that a good story had been started. And thus no engagement. As time wore on I found I really didn't care about any of the characters, or their plights, or what they were trying to accomplish, other than thinking Ellen Page was kind of cute.In an EW interview, Nolan says about his film, Memento, that he was ""trying to transcend the tyranny of linear narrative."" Really? A tyranny? We live in a linear narrative, Chris, but now that I know you feel that way about life, I'll remember not to pay to see your films. In the same interview, Nolan says that he was worried that his audience wouldn't be able to follow his brain-bending movie because of the complex dream-within-a-dream plot... until he lit upon (drum roll) the ""heist-flick model,"" in which the hero-thieves explain their scheme. Yes, Chris, but that's not a very good model. And what's more, it only works if the ""explaining is minimal"" and the director is skilled enough to show and reveal more. It's a moving picture, remember? Yes, the action here is pretty cool, better than the Dark Knight. The camera and stunt work are very good. The music is the same gloomy heavy-handed kind used in Dark Knight (same composer, Hans Zimmer). But the characters are essentially two-dimensional because everything is secondary to the plot, which in spite of its complexity you can understand well enough because it's all explained to you, endlessly. Even Dicaprio wasn't happy with his character and worked with Nolan for two months ""adding layers"" for more emotional depth (see the Rolling Stone interview). But apparently the complexity and ridiculousness of the plot buried that, or Nolan just didn't know how to deliver it (come to think of it, this may be a problem with all of his films). Plot over character. Cool factor over emotion. You think of the great work DiCaprio did in The Aviator. And the brilliant work by Gordon-Levitt in The 500 Days of Summer. I wasn't much of a fan of Juno, but Ellen Page ""made"" that movie. And of course Michael Caine has made many great movies, including the recent Harry Brown. Also, Ken Watanabe in The Last Samurai. And finally, let's not forget Marion Cotillard's stunning Oscar-winning performance in La Vie En Rose. But they're all struggling mightily here with Nolan's tedious script, and their immense talent is wasted.But of course, I'm all wrong. The movie is a huge hit. It's sure to rack up $500 million or more in worldwide box office sales. Whew! That's good news. Because then Nolan can go on ""transcending the tyranny."""
23602,False,"Action aside, there will be some who will liken this to the Wachowski Brothers' Matrix, given its similarities in combining science fiction with philosophical existentialism issues, with cutting-edge action seemingly beyond its time. Nolan goes one up however, with this attempt as he, like Neo, goes beyond the computerized world of the Matrix, where it's still a construct led by binary ones and zeroes, good and evil battling it out under black and white rules. Rules that one cannot escape from since they are what binds our universe together. Here Nolan goes into that untapped power of the mind, the dream worlds that we create in our subconscious, where the dreamer has everything in his subtle control, where anything goes as far as the imagination dare venture beyond physical limitations and rules.This allowed for such a film to be created from a simple idea with a bank heist premise having its skill-based assembled team break into unsuspecting victims to steal ideas locked away in the mind. Nolan loves to tease and test the audience, not lulling us into complacency, with Inception beginning in the thick of the action with tremendous questions being asked as we try and digest the multitude of information thrown at us, with the whys and the what ifs answered in due course, needing to pay attention to subtle details, ideas and concepts to make the film work.We follow Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his lieutenant Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) as information hackers and social engineers of the new age, offering their services as the black and white ops type either to teach corporate honchos how to defend against like-minded and skilled peers, or to be engaged by these same industrialists to steal information from the competition. With the promise of being able to return to the USA without being arrested at immigration, Cobb accepts the challenge posed by the Japanese Saito (Ken Watanabe), to assemble an A-Team to plant a seed of thought and an idea, known as an inception, into his business enemy Robert Fischer Jr (Cillian Murphy). It's an almost impossible task, but the promise to see his kids again makes Cobb recruit the likes of Ariadne the architect (Ellen Page), Yusuf the chemist (Dileep Rao), and Eames (Tom Hardy) the thief.Like the layers that the characters navigate through, the film is equally layered with engaging subplots that expand the depth and breadth of the characters involved, the largest one involving the mystery behind the disappearance of Cobb's wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) who now lives only in Cobb's subconscious, and always find a way to thwart his grand plans, making Cobb more of a liability with this unspoken handicap that gets worse as the challenges facing the team grows. The story unfolds like a planning of that perennial big bank heist job, with conflicts between members, the building of skills and the meticulous planning all coming together with so many external variables, that seeks to test the skills of every member to the extreme. And that's what makes the film so terribly engaging, while dealing with emotions and romance, obsession and selfishness, which if I may jest, seem to reflect a side of modern day relationships where sometimes one can get tired and need to seek an exit from constantly being with someone else, 24 hours a day, with nobody around.DiCaprio with his name sprawled over the poster above the other cast, delivers that pitch perfect flawed lead character that Nolan has a knack to create, and brought to life by DiCaprio's performance, having the actor showcase a wide range of emotions as a man desperate to hold onto what he deems dear, with hidden secrets so jealously guarded, living and repeating his pain through the constant re-visits to his memory, breaking all rules of the game as told to his protégé Ariadne. Ellen Page holds her own against the seasoned thespian in two scenes which is bound to generate some gasps for the special effects generated as she picks up the necessary skills for the job, in what would be a Neo-like discovery of how seductive a limitless world could be.I can't rave enough of how Nolan got to elicit wonderful performances from his cast of stars, where little nuances can mean so much, without even saying a word. A flick of the eyebrow, a glance at someone, paint that picture to tell a thousand words. Better yet, Nolan's own ability to hold your attention with his storytelling ability and delivering no less than four stunningly created realms all happening simultaneously, each with another as a constraint or a condition to kickstart a chain of events. You're always left guessing whether the team can accomplish their mission, and there's always that constant threat of danger that seeks to derail everything they thought of in their combined state of comatose, What George Lucas does with those simultaneous theatres of war in the finale of each of his Star Wars films, Nolan does it better with just this one, as he puts that grip around you as we flit from one stage to another. There's absolutely nothing quite like the experience of having seen something great, and want to savour it all over again soon.Inception is best experienced on the big screen, and Christopher Nolan has done the ultimate in performing just what the characters of Inception had set out to do, sowing the seed of a premise and concept that holds so much promise, then delivering that promise with aplomb, so much so that you'll want to continue living in that world created by the cognitive senses interpreting what's on screen, then fantasizing on it a lot more with the subconscious. Inception is definitely one of the best this year, if not THE best film of 2010 thus far. Don't miss this film!"
23603,False,"Inception is the Smartest film of the YearINCEPTION (PG-13) Directed by Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins and The Dark Knight) Inception is the smartest film you will see all year. It never plays down to the audience, in fact, it assumes the audience is intelligent. Inception tells the story of Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) as a thief with the rare ability to enter people's dreams and steal their secrets from their subconscious. His skill has made him a hot commodity in the world of corporate espionage but has also cost him everything he loves. Cobb gets a chance at redemption when he is offered a seemingly impossible task: Plant an idea in someone's mind. If he succeeds, it will be the perfect crime, but a dangerous enemy anticipates Cobb's every move.This movie is challenging, but always in a fun and inventive way that keeps you captivated. It is an updated 40's crime drama with a technological twist that just works. After the fight scene in the hallway, you will agree with me that Christopher Nolan will no doubt take home a few Oscars this year. Sound Design, Cinematography, best Original Screenplay, Director and Film unless something monumental is released between now and then. One scene alone should get Nolan the Oscar, and that being the city folding back on itself. Most films this year are like sitting down to a bowl of potato chips, Inception is like sitting down to the juiciest thickest most filling steak dinner you've had in years. Inception opens Friday July 16 5 out of 5 Stars Jay Fox"
23604,False,"Okay, so when I dream, anything can happen. I have had dreams within dreams, and there was no special time ratio. Everything is so contrived, when, as others have mentioned, the director could have done just about anything he wanted since it is a dream. I'm not sure how people can dream together and have any kind of dream harmony, or effect any outcome on others. None of it makes any sense, and it's just a skeleton on which to hang crappy computer generated images; those beach scenes are especially cartoon-ish and pathetic. I love Leo DiCaprio and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and that the two of them together couldn't redeem this pseudo intellectual turd of a movie just shows how bad it really is."
23605,False,"Having seen this 24 hours ago the more I think about it the more I think this is over-hyped and actually a rather poor movie. On leaving the cinema I was prepared to give it a 7 (well short of it's 9.3 on IMDb) but on reflection I'm downgrading it to a 5.5.Why? For a start the writing is ridiculously weak. The plot, although slightly intriguing in that you do make the effort to keep up with the triple (or is it quadruple) levels of depth, is preposterous. In short it's about a dream within a dream within a dream. I think that's correct! But, that said, who cares? It might be crafty but it isn't crafted. It's self indulgent in the extreme.Whilst not gratuitously violent, there are a lot of killings in this film, but the ""goodies"" are dead eye dicks to a man (and woman) whilst the ""baddies"" are way, way beyond inept. With five targets and two and a half hours of incessant shooting I counted only 2 direct hits, whereas the ""baddies"" must have taken in excess of 200 fatalities. Just plain silly really.Then there's the casting. Di Caprio is starting to look desperate for a decent acting part and Ellen Page absolutely sucks compared to her magnificent role in Juno (it's the writing I tell ya).The special effects are at times good, on one or two occasions I'd call them remarkable, but not on many. As an emotional engagement exercise it has all the impact of a potato. I've been more moved by a night in watching Blomberg TV.Christopher Nolan is just not that great a director or writer on this occasion.Sorry folks.(His mind was the scene of a crime.)"
23606,False,"Christopher Nolan, the visionary director behind ""Batman Begins"", ""The Dark Knight"", and ""Memento"", has finally brought to life his project of more than twenty years. Featuring a cast of some of the world's greatest stars, both young and old, and having been filmed in locations in six different countries, ""Inception"", in the words of the L.A. Times, ""blends the best of traditional and modern film-making"".Leonardo DiCaprio headlines as Cobb, a con man who specializes in stealing people's secrets from within their very minds. Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""3rd Rock from the Sun"") gives a remarkable performance as his partner in crime. Tom Hardy (""Star Trek: Nemesis""), Dileep Rao (""Avatar""), and Ellen Page (""Juno"") round out a team of highly talented ""intrusion experts"". They are hired by Ken Watanabe (""The Last Samurai"") to do the impossible: rather than steal an idea from their target's (Cillian Murphy, ""28 Days Later ..."") mind, they are to plant an idea through a process called ""inception"".There are many words to describe this movie. ""Crime drama"", ""sci-fi thriller"", ""international intrigue"", and ""mind-bending masterpiece"" all would certainly be on the list. Nolan keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very last second, barely giving you time to breathe as you try to peel the layers and decide what is real and what is illusion. There are many questions to answer as you follow the characters ever deeper into the world of dreams. The greatest questions, however, surround Cobb himself and his motives.Cobb is not your typical thief taking on ""one last job"". While his partner believes Cobb is just hoping to complete the job so he can see his children again, Page's character begins to suspect that he is seeking something more. She soon learns that Cobb is haunted by the memory of his dead wife, played by Marion Cotillard (""Public Enemies""), who does far more than simply distract him from his duties. After all, in the world of the subconscious, even the smallest distraction can take you in directions you never expected to go.Like the layers of the dream worlds the team constructs for their marks, this movie is crafted to convey one story; one single point that comes delivered wrapped in marvelous visual effects, pulse-pounding action sequences, intelligent dialogue, and even a fair amount of humor. That single point, the two words I would use to describe this movie, is ""love story"". The great mystery of ""Inception"" is the story of Cobb and his family, his wife and children, what he has done to them, and how far he will go to recover them. While most reviewers may focus on the spectacular special effects or the unique storytelling elements, I believe the central theme of ""Inception"" is the unraveling of Cobb's character. Everything else is a vehicle for this storyline.As a writer, I think this is one of the finest examples of good storytelling I've seen. As a moviegoer, I can't think of a better way to spend my money. I would recommend ""Inception"" to anyone, be they seeking an action movie, an art film, a mystery thriller, or a science-fiction wonder ride. For me, it is all those things and more; but at its heart, it is a poignant love story.(Read original review here: http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=419359136543)"
23607,False,"Surely IMDb can survive without yet another amateur review for ""Inception"". I'm only doing this to justify myself about the 2 star rating. I would normally have rated this movie with 6 points. But as other reviewers state, I feel that is just fair to give a lower rate to balance a little the totally overblown rate it has. This film looks fantastic in Blu-Ray. There are several sequences that are a real visual delight (the Paris café scene where Di Caprio's character is explaining the young dream architect portrayed by Ellen Page and the 0 gravity sequence in the second layer dream). But the problem is that beyond that you don't have much. Looks like Mr. Nolan sacrificed plot line and character developed for the technical aspects. The plot is not complex, is just convoluted. The characters are cardboard thin and underdeveloped. I never imagined dreams could be as uninteresting as in this movie. Have you ever watched Fellini's movies? Or Tartovsky's? or Cocteau's? or Buñuel's? Plenty of dream-like images there  One last word: it's a pity to gather such fine actors and waste them as Mr. Nolan did here; Joseph Gordon Levitt, Cillian Murphy and Watanabe san do what they can with the script, but Leonardo DiCaprio can't do much to give some life to his character. An utterly uninvolving movie. I'll stay with Matrix if I want a Hollywood production dealing with a superficial questioning of our perception of reality and sub consciousness."
23608,False,"It is so unnecessary and fairly persuasive; unsuccessfully, insistingly imposing the audience there is a great mystery going on but weak fiction just causes a perception of a confusing and boring movie in you. Full of very irritating logical errors, incoherence and lack of intelligence. Categorically, this kind of movies are not science fiction, they are action movies because there is no science going on in them. By the way, there's no mystery about dreaming, your brain is just rearranging the randomly recorded data during the day; defragmenting them according to their relations and deleting the unnecessary ones."
23609,False,"I've seen many of director Christopher Nolan's films by now. Here are my thoughts on each of them:Following (1998)The craft is really superb and the thematic elements are intriguing, but on the whole it comes off as very gimmicky. In the end I felt kinda cheated.Memento (2000)The craft is really superb and the thematic elements are intriguing, but on the whole it comes off as very gimmicky. In the end I felt kinda cheated.Insomnia (2002)The craft is really superb and the thematic elements are intriguing, but on the whole it comes off as very gimmicky. In the end I felt kinda cheated.Batman Begins (2005)After feeling kinda cheated by previous Nolan efforts, I did not bother with this one. (What truly serious director does Batman, anyway?)The Prestige (2006)The craft is really superb and the thematic elements are intriguing, but on the whole it comes off as very gimmicky. In the end I felt kinda cheated.The Dark Knight (2008)Watched this one because of all the high ratings on the internet sites. The craft is really superb and the thematic elements are intriguing, but on the whole it comes off as very gimmicky. In the end I felt kinda cheated. (What truly serious director does Batman, anyway?)Inception (2010)Nolan's best effort yet, and while the craft is really superb and the thematic elements are certainly intriguing, on the whole it comes off as *extremely*, pointlessly gimmicky. In the end I felt kinda cheated.Overall assessment:M. Night Shyamalan with more elaborate gimmicks. Emperor Nolan isn't wearing any clothes, you philistines!"
23610,False,"The idea is great but the final output is not.Too much James-Bond-a-like shooting and dummy car chasing scenes that won't do any good for taking the movie forward. You will just wait that the action(mindless shooting) stops and the movie will continue.Why they are dreaming skyscrapers, guns and soldiers instead of something more imaginative? The biggest problem is not that the story has some big holes. The movie is just boring most of the time. I hope we will not see Inception part II.Leonardo is not good choice for his role. Others do quite well.This movie will not give you any surprises."
23611,False,"This movie is way too talky and confusing to enjoy. Add to that a director/writer with absolutely zero sense of humor and wit, and we are left with this dry onslaught on your senses. I think Mr Nolan may have brains and be some people's cup of tea, but his humorless and emotionless films have all left me extremely disappointed. INCEPTION in particular was torture for me. There is absolutely no payoff by the end of the film because we do not care about any of these characters. If it were not for the genius score, this could easily be the worst waste of time I have had in a movie theater in years.I see there is some controversy and speculation as to where all the rave reviews are coming from. It's possible that there are many who do love this film. But they weren't in our packed audience. One person clapped at film's end, and it quickly died when no one joined in. Instead most people bolted for the doors after this overlong dud."
23612,False,"Nice try at making a movie that isn't a remake, sequel, or based on a book. Doesn't work in the end, though. Transparent, easy-to-guess plot with no twists, ho-hum action scenes, and no real conflict. And the key to the main character knowing he's in the ""real world"" is that he has a top that never stops spinning?!?! Huh? Did anyone check the script to realize that perpetual motion belongs in the DREAM part of this movie?Clumsy film. I love sci-fi, love Nolan's other flicks, even thought DiCaprio was pretty good, but didn't make up for such boredom and nonsense. This is far from a ""masterpiece."" Basically it's a remake of the Matrix for people who thought the Matrix was ""too sci-fi""."
23613,False,"Do not let anyone tell you anything about this movie before you go see it. It is best experienced with thrilled expectations -- and you will not be disappointed. The acting by all cast members is terrific, the story line is amazing, and the special effects are breathtaking. I am so honored to have attended a sneak preview of this movie. The theater was packed without one empty seat and the crowd was so into the movie, it was silent until the end. Their reaction at the end was loud and vocal. I will admit that I got a terrible tension headache from the intensity of being a part of this experience. But I will never ever forget the movie. I also must admit there were several times while watching the movie that I wanted someone to explain things to me (I commented to my husband -- WTF?) but rode it out, thinking, comprehending and understanding. I do think that younger people will ""get"" the story better than older people, since they play multi-tiered level games, so the concept won't be so difficult to wrap their brains around it. Outside the theater afterward, no one would leave -- they just stood around talking about it, reliving scenes, ideas and concepts. This is THE movie to see!"
23614,False,Well to speak Christopher Nolan's movie memento i saw some what quiet a long time ago i just came into the genre of unfolding events but it was an exceptional movie to watch and i said man i have to check out who is the maker of this film i was hoping for some biggie should be behind its making and then i came to know Christopher Nolan and for years he has done very less films and delivered us all his potential great movies to entertain the audience.And Now He Has done it again with another great movie inception such a remarkable movie you just get to know we have seen movies like the matrix and the talk about mind games movies but it is different from all others because Christopher Nolan has a different mind perception of all others who have tried a different acting is great and how the characters take you into it all you got to do is sit back keep your eyes and ears open and the rest will follow with you.
23615,False,"I've never done a review before so be gentle, but having attended the Irish premiere of Inception last night I felt compelled to write and tell people to ""go and see this movie"". If you only see one picture all year make sure this is it.As people have stated dream movies have been done before however not with this style and 'complicated simplicity' (you'll understand what I mean when you see it).The acting by everyone is first rate, if the emotional story of Cobb and Mal wasn't believable then the film would fall asunder however Di Caprio/Coitillard carry it off to perfection. Everyone else in the ensemble cast is terrific with particular mention to Tom Hardy (get this guy more work).Unlike many reviewers I didn't find the story difficult to follow although rapt attention is essential, and Nolan has delivered a story which doesn't attempt to talk down to you as I felt with the Matrix instead it draws you in and delivers in the last hour probably the finest piece of film making I've ever seen.The end of the movie was met with rapturous applause and I realized my hands were shaking I had tears running down my face and sweat running down my back. Truly outstanding stuff, Christopher Nolan you're a genius."
23616,False,"I guess there are some drawbacks in having been around when Matrix came out and remembering the revolution it stirred up. Since then i inevitably think about it when a movie tries to tackle the boundaries of reality. In this sense, the best thing about Inception is that it came out more than a decade after Matrix, thus allowing the critical mass of new viewers to grow up and embrace it without much prior knowledge of cinema.Similar to other Christopher Nolan movies, there is little you can complain about in terms of ""fun factor"", production qualities or actors' performance. But the problems arise when we descend to a deeper level where ""big topics"" are supposedly to be discussed. There we encounter a storyline and arguments resembling a background scenario of a superior first-person video game. In fact, when you ponder about it, there is little to Inception apart from visual experience, which is the norm for blockbusters with high ratings on IMDb."
23617,False,"I really wanted to like Inception because of great cast, because of stunning music, because of an interesting premise (Pros). But nope... It needs more than that to make a movie work for me.Cons: There's no character development, no engaging personal relations and no soul... Plain action disguised as dreamworld&psych exploration. And too much action just killed it for me. Not that I dislike some action from time to time, especially if it serves it's purpose (ie Fight club, Equilibrium...) but action in Inception was it's primary and only relevant element. Everything other served holy action and everything happened in the name of action. Interesting plot was there to support action, not vice versa:( Like some of the other reviewers, I see some similarity between this one and Shutter island (beside of DiCaprio:) But I liked Shutter island much much more. They both pretend to be mind twisters, tense and clever. Shutter island almost did it, but Inception missed the point. And I blame Nolan for that. Too pretentious director made a too pretentious movie. So just 7,3 from me"
23618,False,"In my eyes this movie was awful. Now most people who I've told my opinion have accused me of being ""simple"" and ""not understanding it"". I believe I understood the movie very well, I appreciate Nolan's original idea and effort. It's just a shame that this idea is a piece of garbage. I enjoy intelligent movies, but there is nothing intelligent or even remotely exciting about people going into dreams, and then into dreams, and then into dreams again. The whole idea is simply ridiculous, and when Leonardo and Ariadne are in a dream together and Ariadne starts moving a huge glass door around - what on earth? Moving on to Leonardo, I cannot understand how such a poor, boring and depressive actor gets so much fame. I'm assuming this is all because of Titanic, but his role in Inception is shockingly boring and bad. And am I the only one who seems to see a pattern in Leo's movies (in both Inception and Shutter Island Leonardo's wife is dead, but he seems to think that she isn't)? Anyway, out of all the cast only Tom Hardy playing Eames is remotely likable. After seeing Cilian Murphy in some other brilliant roles (e.g. 28 Days Later) I was extremely disappointed while watching him become more miserable with every second in Inception. Leonardo's sidekick Arthur is plain annoying. I wish there had been more action in this movie other than in the scene in the snowy place. Aside from that, Inception is just a lot of talking about complete nonsense and lots of views of Leonardo's scared, confused face. Christopher Nolan made this movie way too ""intelligent"". The end result is tragic. One of the most overrated movies ever."
23619,False,"I wanted to like Inception because I think most of the people involved are talented, but it is just an endless exposition of the ever-changing 'rules' of the dreamworld. It's a shame. It isn't confusing, but it is very boring. There are no engaging characters and it has no trace of humour. It does have some good performances and... nope, that's it.It's not a terrible film, it's just very very dull. When all rules are taken away, it would be nice to see some genuine imagination - not a few FX set-pieces which don't, even at a most basic level, do anything to help the wafer-thin story, You know what this is like? It's like reading a dream diary - a fragmented collection of somebody else's ultimately vapid ideas. It's worth watching once to say ""Was that it?"" and shrug.Watch Mr Nobody instead. It takes Nolan to school."
23620,False,"After several weeks of hearing praise about Inception from friends, critics, and glowing reviews on IMDb, I finally gave in and took my wife to see it this weekend. I really wanted to love this movie as I am a huge fan of most Sci-Fi and Ellen Page. My wife usually loves Leonardo and Ellen.We could not have been more disappointed with this train wreck of a movie. We were both bored and ready to leave the theater after the first 45 minutes but stuck it out till the end hoping for something good that never came. We agreed that it was one of the WORST films we have ever seen in our lifetimes.Yes - we did GET the gist of the convoluted plot, but the dialog and visuals were at times laughable and silly as Christopher Nolan force-fed the audience with course after course of nonsensical explanations of how dreams work, their layers, and the non-specific techniques the poorly defined characters would use for ""extraction"" and their ""inception"" caper.I felt zero attachment to any of the characters in the story and didn't much care about their fate. If you've seen the trailer you've seen ALL of the cool special effects nearly in their entirety. The much-ballyhooed scenes that involve floating people were just ripped-off variations of similar scenes from The Matrix series.The only explanation I have for the popularity of Inception is my theory that more than 70% of theater audiences fell asleep during the first 10 minutes and dreamed that they saw a good film.If you want to experience excitement in dreams, just lay down and take a nap. Don't waste your hard-earned cash on this boring mess."
23621,False,"This film is in the vein of movies like ""The Matrix"" that flirt with the idea of an unknown but discoverable substrate underlying our ordinary experiences. This one comes especially close to Poe's view that all that we see is but a dream within a dream. The premise used to question our grasp on reality is fairly original: a team of individuals with different specialties has the ability to enter and stage other people's dreams, extract information from their subconscious and, crucially, even implant ideas with the expectation that these will, so to speak, rise to the surface--an original method of suggestion. The film spends quite a bit of time acquainting the viewer with the main characters and the peculiar laws that govern their work before setting them on the mission the plot centers on. While it is not always easy to follow, I found this setup the most arresting part of the film. Unfortunately, the main narrative does not, in my view, live up to the promise of the setup. The film is laden with scenes that would fit into any of a legion of Hollywood action flicks: car chases, hand to hand combat, explosions, shoot-'em-ups. It cannot be said that all of these serve to advance the narrative; the rationale for proceeding from one hackneyed scene to the next is frequently contrived, illogical or murky. Technically, they are well done and should gratify those who thrive on such fare. Visually, I found the scenes that show the generation of dreamscapes most laudable: the effects truly dazzle. I won't say the film entirely neglects the story it sets in motion but I certainly feel the time devoted to car chases and explosions could have been profitably devoted to developing the story and characters. To give a glaring example, I would have liked to have known the aftermath of the heros' intervention in their target's subconscious."
23622,False,"i cant believe how overrated this film is! its been done so many times before. dark city, matrix, the cell even nightmare on elm street (going in to grab freddy, and being awoke by a friend, alarm clock or candle), which are all better. i cant see anything original at all about this script and can imagine there will be lots of forums discussing the confusing story line. if you want this sort of deep film your better off with 12 monkeys or vanilla sky. i feel as if I've wasted two and a half hours of my life and 15 pounds out of my pocket. very very disappointed. everything leonardo di caprio does always seems to get lots of praise, but can only think of a handful of good films he has done."
23623,False,"I doubt anybody will read this review, since it's neither a ""fan rave"" nor a ""hated it."" The movie gets four stars from me primarily because the CGI is not as bad as most other recent movies and Leo actually does some decent work. (Gordon-Levitt is also quite good, but he's canceled out by Ellen Page, who is, as usual, barely tolerable and not at all believable in her role.) Frankly, I just don't get the hype over ""Inception"" as metaphor, and it sure doesn't impress me as being a truly deep or complex movie. It's more like the level of the well-known character explaining how our solar system could actually itself be an atom, with the sun as the nucleus, etc.Actually, I take that back...it IS a complex movie. Needlessly complex, I might add. The whole set of rules for entering into (and out of) someone's dreams are so ridiculously complex that they obviously exist only to set up the action sequences. Unfortunately, this makes it necessary for all the characters to explain them to each other throughout most of the movie. (Why is this? If they're professionals at doing this sort of thing, why do they all need to have it explained to them each time? That's like reminding a soldier how to take the safety off his weapon just before exiting the personnel carrier.) Furthermore, the dream world is not dream-like. It's more like the virtual world of ""Tron."" If I were shown the action sequences with no exposition, I'd guess that the characters were in a virtual world, or in another dimension, but not in a dream.Finally, in spite of some good performances, I didn't give a lickspittle about the characters. What they are doing (or attempting to do) is immoral and unethical. And what risks they face are basically virtual as well. Who gives a flip? There's no redemption, no character development, no introspection (at any substantive level), and what you're left with is a mixture of pop psychology and ""the solar system itself may just be an atom."" This may be a good film on some levels, but I didn't care for it."
23624,False,"INCEPTION is a film in which you want to go in knowing nothing because it's best seen with no prior knowledge. So I'm just going to not say a word about the plot and have the film unfold in front of you, sometimes literally. It's pretty difficult to explain what INCEPTION really is because it's damn packed with so many interesting ideas. Really, when you come out of the theater, you'll only think, ""What did I just see?"" The film is filled with so much ambition and so many original ideas that it captivates you. In fact, I think this is the fastest 150 minute film I've ever seen because it felt like 80 minutes! I really wanted to see more when the credits rolled.Unfortunately, INCEPTION isn't a perfect film. It falls short on its ambition. Some ideas weren't as developed as I hope they would be and others weren't presented clear enough. In fact, it's as if the characters spoke in another type of jargon exclusively made for psychologists pursuing in the career of dreams. Also, the story isn't all that special. Another common complaint you might hear about the film is that the characters are flat. It's true. The film presents us with six or seven characters but does absolutely nothing with them. Leonardo DiCaprio's character is the only character that's fleshed out. In some cases, I didn't care for the characters when their lives were at stake.Still, the performances by the ensemble cast are really good. I enjoyed Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy in their roles a lot. I might not be the only person to notice this but I thought Leonardo DiCaprio played the exact same character as he did in SHUTTER ISLAND. I couldn't get past Ken Watanabe's thick accent. It was hard to understand him in many of his scenes. Marion Cotillard did a great job, though.The film is also visually intricate, if that makes sense and even that description doesn't give the film justice. Again, it's really hard to explain. The visual effects were really excellent along with the action scenes but don't expect this film to be filled with action. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer (AKA: One of the best composers ever) is fantastic, much like Zimmer's other soundtracks.Overall, INCEPTION is a flawed but seriously excellent film that presents some very, very, very interesting ideas. It's a wholly original film, which is great considering the amount of remakes, re-imaginings, sequels, prequels, etc. that we've gotten in the past few years, let alone this year. The characters could have been fleshed out a lot more. Still, I was absolutely engaged throughout by the story, and Christopher Nolan's ingenious script and direction just sucks you in. This is the perfect cure for this year's lackluster summer."
23625,False,"All I could manage to say as I left the theater was, ""That was awesome!"" This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. From the story to the acting to the action, there wasn't anything lacking from this film. There are so many layers, not only in the plot but in the depth of story telling that go on in this film. I don't know how he fit so much story into a couple of hours and still it can make perfect sense. This is a movie you can watch 10 times, and I probably will, and still catch something you didn't see before. It was so easy to get caught up and forget you were in a theater and not actually in the room with the characters. I can't remember the last time I was so immersed in a film. I actually had to remind myself occasionally that it was only a movie. I loved everything about this. The action sequences were just amazing, I don't think these things have ever been done in film before. It was like watching a perfectly done live action video game. The mind twisting story keeps you guessing till the end, and even after. There was even a tragic but heart warming love story in the middle. To fit all of this into a film is just incredible. My advice to anyone, is to find the biggest screen in a theater you can and go see this movie. I don't even think an IMax screen is big enough for this gnarly piece of cinema."
23626,False,"I got an invite to a free prescreening of this movie! I had been seeing some previews of the movie but I hadn't really listened to what the previews were saying at all. I hadn't read anything about what the movie was about. So I went into it without any kind of expectations what so ever.I love Science Fiction and this one did not disappoint!! I thought it was a great movie. If you have a chance to see it on some kind of digital projection or IMAX do it. An old film reel theater just wouldn't do it justice.It is pretty action packed, lots of twists and turns, gets a little deep, and leaves you thinking with a little bit of a hanger at the end. Phenomenal cast! I would pay money to see it again and recommend everyone to go see it when it opens Friday! Two Thumbs up! -StEpHeN"

23628,False,"One is a rate to balance properly the fanatic reviews here. This is a good movie. But is impossible that this movie flies above from the source: The Matrix. Inception is a rip-off and comes 10 years late for a chance to be consider original. Well, that's it. Good soundtrack,good cinematography, but none original. The effects are pretty good, but not jaw dropping. The plot is just complex, but not intelligent .Nolan has not been nominee for Academy Award and that is fair. If the Watchoski was not too, why should be Nolan? I recommend people to watch this movie. But I recommend those people don't surf the hype. Otherwise they will be catch in Nolan's marketing."
23629,False,"If there was ever a film to label as ""overrated"", it would be The Dark Knight. If there was ever another film to label as ""overrated"", it would be Inception. I just don't understand what it is about Christopher Nolan's films but they have the tendency to receive large amounts of unwarranted and undeserved praise.While they are very well-made films, they are for the most part nothing more than entertaining popcorn flicks (Memento being the one exception). Popcorn flicks of the up-most quality but nothing truly memorable or deep. Now that I have gotten that out of the way, lets get on with the review.Now, basically, Inception is a heist film with a twist. The heists take place inside of a dream, thus allowing for some creative and tricky special effects to be pulled off. These effects are pretty amusing to watch, most notably a scene where the gravity of a hallway is shifting and the two actors are duking it out amidst the gravity shifts, and this makes for some impressive-looking chaos.The story while somewhat original, wasn't pulled off as smoothly as it could have been in my opinion. There were just far too many plot holes that you could drive a tank through. Now with a certain proper ending, these plot holes would diminish, but Nolan has yet to confirm just what the ending means so the plot holes are left intact. If you want a better idea of what I mean by that, PM me.Acting for the most part is good and gets the job done. Just don't expect anything Oscar-caliber here. If there was one stand-out performance in Inception, I would definitely say it's from Leo Dicaprio. The guy proves time and time again that he's one of the better young actors working right now. The rest of the cast gives passable performances, but nothing special. Michael Caine is wasted, and I feel the only reason he was hired was to get his name on the box.Not much needs to be said about the special effects. They're some of the best yet, and at times even creative. Possibly the strongest aspect of the film, next to the effects, is the musical score. Inception has one of the best scores in recent memory. My hat is off to Hans Zimmer. The effects, score, and flawed but intriguing story come together in making Inception a very enjoyable and entertaining film. It's definitely smarter than your average popcorn flick, but at the end of the day it's still just a popcorn flick. Nothing more, nothing less. It lacks the emotional punch and attention to detail that made District 9 so great (now that's a true masterpiece, and one of the greatest sci fi films ever made).I give Inception 7.5/10 and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun film that will also make them think a little bit."
23630,False,"I thought this was a good movie, but I also have to admit that I am a little puzzled by the buzz it generated among movie-goers.While I've enjoyed most of director Nolan's works, I found this one to be missing something. It did not captivate me as much. For a story about dreams, there's nothing in the movie that felt dream-like or creative to me. It felt mechanical and laborious.I did not understand the responsibility and work the architect has to do. There were no perplexing mazes in the dreams that I had hoped to see. The character Ellen Page played was only a plot device to lead us into Dicaprio's unresolved issues with the past, nothing more.Maybe I am not intelligent enough to fully appreciate this movie sure, just as I don't understand some reviewers with their difficult choice of expressions. But to me, some of the best books are for children.Oh, I think I know what was missing in this movie that I mentioned earlier. While trying hard to make audience wonder and calculate it just loses heart.Still a good movie but just weak at the joints it seems."
23631,False,"If there is anything that Inception has taught me, it's that anything is possible with films. There are very few films that I have seen that deliver this message. Star Wars delivered a galaxy full of imaginative creation. The Matrix showed us a world where rules could be broken and people could dodge bullets. Avatar took us to another world the likes of which we have never seen. Now, Inception takes us to places we can only dream of. I will start by saying two things that may contradict each other. The first is that this film has something for everyone. There's plenty of action, drama, noir, suspense, and mind games for those who like to be intrigued. At the same time, this will not be a film for everyone. The nit-picky will find all the little tiny things to question, most notably the logic involved in the whole subconscious sneakery and 'whose dream are we in?' logic. But quite honestly, any possible holes are completely forgiven. Not only is this the best written film of the year, but this is one of the most imaginative films in years.I really have to applaud Nolan for taking a chance. Few filmmakers would dare to go out on such a limb and not only try and create such a complex web of dream logic and rules, but also make sense of so many things going on at once. At one point in the film there are four different realities occurring at the same time. There are only a few filmmakers I can even think of that would dare try and create such feat. Even fewer I can think of that make it work. And Nolan does. At first, all the dream logic had my head buzzing, but it mattered little once we hit the dream world. While dizzying, the exposition fits. It's so fascinating and so far from anything that we have seen that the first hour, which is mainly made up of explanations of how things work, is rather welcome as opposed to frowned upon.Nolan's writing shines here. He does what The Matrix once did and bends rules, even breaking some to shape a wholly different reality where cities topple and even gravity gives way to a change in the rules of reality. It's completely fascinating and suspenseful. I even found myself exhaling out loud. And while it may seem like nothing much more than a whole bunch of pretty images and special effects, this is all supported by a strongly written main character and well acted supporting cast. Although the only really deep relationships here are between DiCaprio's character Cobb and his wife and Page's character, the cast as a whole is enjoyable. Joseph Gordon Levitt is the action heavy, doing a lot of the physical fighting, while Tom Hardy is the comic relief (when comedy presents itself). There are a few a members who could be called one note. Watanabe's character is a fairly one note evil corporate head type and Cillian Murphy plays the gullible victim. But even these characters have moments of humanity which shine through.While the film deals in reality defying moments, there are some very entertaining, more practical elements, like the shootouts and the heist planning. These play out like their subsequent genre staples, and I'm very thankful for that. The shootouts are practical and exciting. The heist elements will be familiar to anyone who is familiar with the heist sub-genre, but in this case it's all about people who deal in cerebral elements and must plan their actions around mental manipulation and subconscious trickery. I don't think I could say enough about my enjoyment of this film, but I will say that it is truly one of the best film events in recent memory that I have enjoyed. While this summer has been filled with disappointment at the theater, Inception was worth it. If this film doesn't grab your imagination by the balls, then I don't know what will."
23632,False,"I walked into the theater knowing relatively nothing about this film, and I walked out...knowing even less. From the moment it begins to the moment it ends, you will be wondering what is going on. These initial questions are simply because those trailers we've been watching all year have hardly prepared us for what is about to happen. Most of us just buy a ticket on our faith in either Christopher Nolan or Leonardo DiCaprio. (In my case: both.) As the movie progresses, your questions grow deeper, more layered, just as the dreams you are viewing excavate the furthest reaches of the unconscious. It's an absolute ride, and in IMAX, it's astounding.It's easy to see how this is the product of Nolan's work in Memento. It deals with the same issues of our narrator's reliability and questions of reality. Both main characters have a tragic self-awareness that seems like a plus in the beginning of the movie, but by the end, you'll wonder if what they trusted to be true and what you trusted to be true is even true at all. Like the dreams themselves, the plot lines and characters begin to fall apart, but our Architect, Christopher Nolan, is the one pulling the strings. This is a film that moves beyond its medium and pulls you in. I'd almost say it breaks the fourth wall without even trying to.It goes without saying that the special effects are one of the highlights of Inception. This will probably be The Matrix of our time, but in a much subtler way. As Dom says, ""It's only when you wake up that you realize there was something strange."" This strangeness is embraced and pulled throughout the film. However, the mazes, infinite staircases, and alternate realities these special effects create are not limited to just providing an aesthetic wonder, but they serve to symbolically reinforce many of the main issues of the film. The paradox of an infinite staircase will be itching your brain for a few hours after you finish watching.The performances are pitch perfect. I initially thought that the characters were a bit one- dimensional and not incredibly developed. Don't be alarmed though. Nolan hasn't lost the touch that created his Batman and his Joker. I believe there are deliberate reasons for this lack of background, which will surely feed into the theorists that will begin sprouting all over the internet after this weekend. Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard provide the emotional and narrative center of the film. Being the Oscar winning and nominated actors they are, these roles are played beautifully. It's as if they don't even realize they're the ones we're all focused on. I would've given this a 10/10 if it weren't for the excessive use of Hans Zimmer's music. I'm a major fan of Zimmer's work, but I believe music in a film is instrumental when trying to give your audience some sort of cathartic release. At the moment I needed that from the score, it had already been playing non-stop for an hour, so it really made no difference in my emotional response. That's my only complaint, but I'm a film score nerd so don't worry about it.I'll end this now before I start confusing myself even more. It's a privilege, though, to see an auteur like Christopher Nolan working today, using the summer blockbuster as his medium. You'll leave the theater feeling as if you just ""witnessed"" something."
23633,False,"I must be, like, getting old and jaded or something. I found the movie predictable and more straightforward than I hoped it would be.A good alternative name for the film would have been ""Wait, what?"" as if there was any less action you'd be constantly asking yourself why the eff they didn't do X, or why Y didn't happen etc. The word ""contrived"" will keep nudging at your brain if you're not doing an exceptional job of suspending all disbelief along with all common sense.The final scene of the film was rather obvious from early on I thought.I found it relatively easy to follow, exactly what I was expecting, and totally lacking in interesting ""Sixth Sense"" plot twists. Everything pretty much was as it was presented to be.Not sure how this makes it to #3 on the all-time best list.The Matrix was way more entertaining...G."
23634,False,"I went into the cinema to see this film with sky high expectations given the domestic and international reviews of it. Phrases like ""modern classic"" and ""landmark film"" made me think that I was in for something truly special in terms of film history along the lines of Citizen Kane and The Godfather.Turns out I wasn't, well not all the way anyway. I won't bother with the whole plot line, since it's very sprawling and complicated, but suffice it to say that my main disappointment with the film stems from the fact that the thematics of the story simply are too limited and ordinary compared to the potential impact of the film's gimmick: the fact that you can enter somebody's dream to steal information or plant ideas.The plot revolves mainly around industrial espionage, a theme which simply does nothing for me emotionally. Who cares if one industrial tycoon wants to stop another? The dream concept of the film is truly magical and innovative and is a very compelling feature of the film itself. But why in heaven's name marry it to something as pointless as industrial espionage? What happened to something like the fight for world domination? It would have given the film infinitely more punch if the plot had centered around some political intrigue in stead. Especially given the unstable nature of the world today with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, huge climate issues, and so forth.The subplot involving Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard's characters to me comes off very flat, their on screen chemistry not being very strong. This is a shame, for the premise of the subplot has great emotional potential.All in all, somewhat of a disappointment, despite the wallop one inevitably receives from the film's take on the concept of entering someone else's dreams."
23635,False,"I remember when they (and Chris Nolan) used to make films about people and their dilemma's. The actual conflict in Inception is just an after-thought to appease. Cobb's issue about wanting to see his children is so tired and played out it is almost laughable. With all the attention that went into the dream process, maybe Nolan could have spent a little more time with human elements of the film.Whether it's a wife who killed her children or a wife who killed herself and left children, we are tired of Leo as the grieving husband (Inception/Shutter Island). Clearly this film was to showcase cleverness in concept and effects. The story is a bare-bones, hackneyed joke.Even the mission is a yawner. Who cares about the rich kid and his rich dad- you don't even get to know them so why care? None of the relationships are below the surface so there is nothing invested in the story.Movies are about relationship, conflict and story. All of these elements are after-thoughts in INCEPTION! This is strictly a concept film whose execution of CGI is way more special then it's attention to story."
23636,False,"Inception was not that great of a movie. There. I said it. I can't believe so many people from the reviews of IMDb.com to my closest friends walking out of this saying this was a great film. Maybe that was my problem. I went into this film thinking this was going to be great but that just wasn't the case. I wasn't involved with the story.And story was the film's main selling point. Yeah, there's the visuals, yeah. They are spectacular, I won't lie. I love how the world moves with their minds and how they were able to get the actors to interact to an otherwise unusual world. And normally the effects is Hollywood's only strength, to draw their audience in with spectacular CGI. No, Inception wants to engross you into it's story.Many were lost. I just did not care.The story mostly revolves around dreams. It's like plugging into the Matrix and the Avatar. Now that I think of it, maybe that's what audiences like. Maybe the average moviegoer likes characters who become something that isn't themselves. Maybe they like characters who are strapped in to a bed or some sort, plugged into something, and then they are subjected into a different world where they have to fight to survive.But if this idea is what Hollywood is catching onto then believe me, it will get old fast. People would look back on this and wonder why audiences liked this in the first place. Inception is not one of those films that will be remembered with some of the greats, especially Nolan's own Batman films. It just doesn't have that kind of impact. Visually, it's stunning, but storywise, no.But hey, if it's everyone's cup of tea."
23637,False,"I have some advice for intelligent people who wish to see a great film about dreams...Watch Mulholland Dr. Instead.I found Inception to be a strange animal, it's almost like a film that has been aimed at cretins to help them feel as though they are intelligent.As far as having my mind blown I found myself still waiting for the ""Blow"" as the film wrapped, following two and a half hours of dull exposition, lacklustre performances, and cliché after cliché all dressed up as the ""next big thing"".I am by no means a ""Nolan hater"" he has made some very solid films up to this point and has real talent, I also do not blame him for this offering as he obviously thought it was good, I blame the easily pleased and intellectually challenged people who have hyped it up to be something it clearly is not.The 3rd greatest film of all time?...Give me a break."
23638,False,"What a disappointment! This movie is a technically good heist movie wrapped in a dream plot, that is boring like hell! The dreams look almost exactly like the reality and during the whole movie constantly somebody is shooting, running or escaping! Christoper Nolan outdoes himself in taking almost all the inspiring and challenging aspects away from an interesting idea! He strings together one exhausting action sequence after an other without any creativity or a fresh, new approach regarding the exploration of dreams! The further you delve into the dream levels, the more you get bored by more spiritless action. At the end i thought: oh, perhaps i missed the point and this is the next James Bond movie and they deliberately left away in the title the 007 to open up a further, contrived dimension. Very tricky! This movie is so overrated, that it hurts. Inception looks like an intelligent, complex movie - that is what it wants to be - but it is only a dull action flick without any character development or intellectual aspiration. Christopher Nolan perhaps knows to impress technically but he fails completely to let me really care about his protagonists and the storyline. Technical perfection, the use of visual and special effects and an allegedly complex story can't substitute the lack of real vision, creativity and good character development! That's the difference between Inception and a masterpiece."
23639,False,"No-one, but no-one has achieved the feel of the dream state like David Lynch. On a fraction of the budget of this film,and zero CGI, he succeeds in being way more unsettling and detached from reality than any other director, and captures the vocabulary of dreaming authentically. Nolan is NOT a genius: The Dark Night was merely OK, and he dragged Gotham City into the gutter of a run - down Detroit, not the fantastical Gothic structures it should be. Memento was more interesting, though.When I saw the trailer I thought: ""Oh God, not Leo again. "" Or is it Neo? And the collapsing and spontaneously forming cityscapes are straight out of Dark City. Dark City was a Noir/Sci- Fi hybrid, too, made a long time before this. Doesn't have the awe-factor of,say 2001, or even Blade Runner.Not original, not brilliant, not lasting.It's true, what another reviewer said. This film is definitely age-indexed. The younger you are, the more impressed you'll be. The older you are, you might nod off, perchance to dream...."
23640,False,"Great ideas grow like a cancer. Sometimes you never really know where they come from.Chris Nolan has never really had a totally original idea. Like Tarantino, he knows other movies so well, their ideas creep into his work, either intentionally or not. While my words on originality may come as inflammatory, my feeling toward his talent, and films is quite the opposite. He's good - real good. But he isn't original. Nobody is. This is the 21st century folks and its all been done. It is the way he's showing us these familiar things, that keeps us coming back.Except for Di Caprio, who never really convinces as a brooding widower/father, the rest of the band is perfect. Not that any of them are actually interesting, the plot is the real character in Inception. Hans Zimmers score is majestic and hugely epic and Wally Pfister's familiar clean visuals make it easy on the eyes.Much like a new roller-coaster at 6 Flags, Inception is a ride we've been on on before. Dreams, reality and all that jazz, but this one has a deeper dose of rabbit hole. We have a heist film set in the frame of corporate psychological espionage - whatever the hell that is.We get Matrix style pseudo reality and weightless gun fights. We get The Game and Total Recall style onion layers. We get the old man in the bedroom of cubist proportions from the Kubrick 2001 finale. Maybe one too many James Bond ski battles. And I'm just getting warmed up. The wife story rings hollow - in fact, it's downright boring. Exposition goes in circles and we never do get enough Watanabe Ken. But it's that layered time of the tiered dreams that makes this one go boom. The elevator that can't drop and that van that just falls forever with the cameras over cranking at 150 frames per second or more. But we don't want it to hit the water. Go deeper Cobb, cause I don't want to get off this one yet. The final joke with the unending spinner? This is Nolan's dream, not Cobb's.It's not visionary, it's not original, but just like the meandering Dark Knight or the wretched nonsense of the Prestige, or the titanic plot holes of Memento, Inception is a rabbit hole that owns you til it's over. This ain't art or philosophy to ride to the top. It's just one great kick all the way down.8/10"
23641,False,"Super blown away by Inception! I can't get over how Christopher Nolan can keep topping himself with each flick. At first I was so scared to see this fail because of the curse of the stellar cast but i should have had faith in Nolan all along. This is just unbelievably good!!! He takes his time telling such a complicated story without dumbing it down or complicating it too much. All the actors play their parts well that even Leo DiCaprio, in a rare way, fades into the character and you forget his celebrity. Everyone and everything is just amazing; from the ominous soundtrack to the sets to the acting and cinematography...all I could say at the end of the flick was, WOW!"
23642,False,"It is the rare film that can completely immerse you in its experience to the point where it is hard to speak afterward. Inception is one of those films - beyond breathtaking, an incredible mind-bending tale full of action and suspense which takes us in to the world of dreams and back.Inception is not only the most intelligent film of the year, it makes the rest look like a finger painting. Christopher Nolan has again manufactured a masterpiece of cinema, the story beyond intricate and full of psychological twists and turns through the mind of dreams which turns the action on its head - sometimes quite literally. The acting is exceptional, with Joseph Gordeon-Levitt standing out and proving again that he has more than enough acting chops to tackle bigger and better roles. What is really incredible is how Nolan manages to carry such an epic film with such a huge scale and yet maintain strong, well-rounded characters. Leonardo DiCaprio's Cobb is at the center of the story and the focus is never taken off of him. Through Leo's performance and through sitting in Cobb's dreams, Inception manages a new way of getting us to feel what the film's characters feel.Hans Zimmer's score perfectly compliments Nolan's actions on screen to create an experience films rarely give us anymore. Both epic and serene, Zimmer adds to the dream-like quality of the film and makes the action set pieces that much larger.The set pieces of Inception are amazing. Not only is it refreshing to see so many special effects without the use of CGI, but the implementation of these special effects are the best I've seen. I only wish I hadn't seen any trailers for this film, as going in to this movie with a blank pallet would have given the movie even more exceptional moments, instead of hoping or waiting for ""that moment"" or smiling when a humorous line from the trailer showed up in the film. I could talk about the one central fight scene of the film for hours, which is nothing short of a benchmark of set design, camera-work and cinematography. I could watch this scene on loop for hours just to be knocked out over and over again by the sheer scale of it.I cannot describe Inception as anything short of a masterpiece. Especially in the dredge of summer cinema, Inception reminds us why we go to films in the first place, giving us an intelligent film which doesn't fly over our heads (not that I'd recommend stepping out of the theater for ever a minute during the movie)."
23643,False,"I watched the first day first show of the movie, it was amazing !!!First of all the story was brilliant and unique. It is actually very difficult to implement such complex story because there are so many characters and so many explanations of how things are going on and so many levels in the movie.The concept of dreams and dreams inside dreams was unique. All the action sequences were very well done.I think such complex stories only great directors can tell because there were so many small pieces in the movie which needed to be connected.I expect this film to be nominated for Oscars because of being unique and very well made movieOnly the directors like Christopher Nolan would dare to implement such unique concepts .VERY GOOD !!!I would give this movie Rating : 10/10 , and it is a MUST SEE !!! ( Please watch it in theaters )"
23644,False,"Once in a while, a film comes along that not only takes the cinematic world by storm, but also rewrites the rules of movie making altogether. Christopher Nolan's latest project, Inception, is one such achievement. Nolan had previously directed the masterpiece, The Dark Knight. That film gave us a whole new look into what a Batman film could be like. But with Inception, he creates something so new; so fresh and original that you wonder if even he fully understood it.Inception is a film about dreams. Dreams are complex, surreal, and full of mystery; all traits that this film also exhibits. In Inception, Leonardo DiCaprio plays an agent who penetrates people's dreams. He is after their secrets, and the dream state is when people have their mental guard down the most. The problem is that anything can happen in a dream. We've all had dreams so we know this. This movie introduces the notion of what it would be like if other people were actually allowed in our dreams. Using the best special effects available, the production team has done their absolute best to portray dreams in a way that makes sense to the viewer, but still comes off as fantastic and incredible.I should warn you: the plot is not easy to follow. One critic who reviewed the movie wondered if it was too smart for general audiences to grasp. Personally, I found that regardless of how complex the storyline got, it pulled off the miracle of not seeming overwrought or unmanageable. This is clearly the trait of a director who has mastered his craft. However, a captain is only as good as his crew. The cast of this film seemed quite committed to the job at hand, and much of the supporting cast (which includes such talented actors and actresses as Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael Caine, and Marion Cotillard) did just as great a job as DiCaprio. All this just goes to show how every little detail was treated with equal care and how flawless the whole production is.Some film buffs will argue that classics ceased to to be made years ago. I certainly don't agree with them, and this film is my proof. It also proves that even the biggest summer blockbusters can be intelligent and artistic. If The Dark Knight was the revolution, than Inception is the reign established afterward."
23645,False,"As a long time lurker on IMDb, I've slowly been working my way through the top 250. I can honestly say that this film has surpassed anything I have ever seen before, despite the hype.I was gripped from start to finish. An amazing concept backed up with emotion and even some groundbreaking action scenes. I spent the entirety of last night trying to get my head around what could have actually happened, such is the depth of the story. Never before has a film had such an impact on me - I woke this morning to the realisation that I had several dreams last night which were very uneasy, for the first time in years.This film is the reason I've finally signed up to this website. I'm a massive fan of films such as 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'The Godfather', but in my opinion, this raises the bar. And that's coming from somebody who is generally not the biggest Sci-Fi fan.If there's ever a film that the masses should rush out to the cinema to see it is this, before it's too late. An absolute must see, and it would be a travesty if it did not make its way to its rightful position in at least the IMDb top 10."
23646,False,"This was a visual treat. A full-blown action movie masked as some sort of intelligent sci-fi. Lots of explosions and people shooting at each other.But no real character development here. No memorable characters. Almost no tension.Christopher Nolan was the guy who directed 'Memento' and reinvented the Batman-franchise, right? What happened here? Instead of sitting on the edge I my seat, I found myself checking my watch. Not good.I expected more than just a lot of cool special effects and Oscar-worthy production design. I expected a gripping story.I left the theater disappointed."
23647,False,"Let me first by saying Inception skin deep is a 10/10 and is beautiful. But deep within the shell of hype is a movie that is still good but lacking at the same time. To all the people Who ultimately love the movie I see reviews like,""Couldn't wait to see this"" ""Masterpiece?"" ""Insanely Intelligent"" which just makes the movie reviewer seem very naive. To all the people who ultimately hate the movie, they always say things like ""I hate Christopher Nolan"" ""This movie is a ***** waste of time"" etc. Which then makes me believe that those people just have something against Christopher Nolan.In my opinion I saw the movie as nothing but a Hollywood movie. It was mildly entertaining and the cast was just a big name with no giant steps in their acting skills. I saw no hard acting parts besides them being themselves trying to talk about ""logical things"".The Reason this movie was mildly entertaining was due to the fact that the storyline wasn't as fresh as people say it was. The editing also seemed jumbled. Trying to cram multiple dreams in one instance in an unorthodox manner in a poorly executed way makes the movie just look even more pretentious. I have seen too many movies that skew the whole concept of reality and dreams and quite frankly this one didn't make me think too hard. Did they have to use pretty CGI? Did they have to have giant gun battles? No.... Of course this movie could of been way better if it wasn't ""Hollywoodized"" and dumbed down to make everyone interested in the action and CGI. Don't forget the decreased amount of talking about things that really needed to be talked about in order to avoid plot holes. Instead they just kept explaining the concept in a repetitious measure and never explained things in depth. Like for instance, the machine the Architect created. (""Architect"" Matrix again) I hate to compare, like most people, but I would have to say that matrix (the first) beats this. The matrix created a universe aside from a concept and also had a foundation to where something originated. In this movie they treated everything so calmly yet everything was so insignificant due to everything being a dream? (Sound confusing and irrational? Tell me about it) What you know and who you know is insignificant and the movie is a continuous Dream, in a Dream, in a Dream that was just piled together to make me think. Is this a Dream? That isn't very exciting to me. I am not over thinking. I am just not chasing a very uninteresting rabbit down a hole.I have seen it once, it was fun, its in the past. It has a less than 20% chance of me buying it on DVD when it comes out and it will soon be forgotten by me. There are more movies out there that blow my mind with their concepts then this one did. It was just a fancy effect, semi action, simple concept movie."
23648,False,"Just finished watching Inception and boy was it a painful experience... Will not even attempt a recap since it is way too convoluted and I lost interest 30 minutes in. How such a movie van receive so many accolades is beyond my comprehension, but then again, quite a few recent stinkers have been praised as masterpieces.What a waste of talent and money! Seems Nolan adopted the J.J.Abrams jerky camera style, little character development, almost no storyline and as much special effects as the budget allows. This is a great recipe for flotsam and Inception fits snugly in that category."
23649,False,"I m waiting for this movie like since an year....i finally watched it.....I always say this thing. Christopher Nolan is a f***ing genius......nd i m sure gonna keep his portrait in my room....within a few days......i loved it....this f***in movie is simply f***in brilliant nd awesome....this is one of the best films i've ever seen.....this movie is a complete mind game....this movie has a typical screenplay....if u miss 10 sec....u miss a lot....it was like a puzzle.....all the time i m watchin this movie...i m completely immersed into it....i m thinking a lot trying to understand it perfectly.....this movie gives a lot of work to ur brain.....by the time the movie finished, every thing look different for some time......the screenplay is damn great.....and Leonardo DeCaprio did a gr8 job.....he had his two best movies this year.....""Shutter Island"" nd now ""Inception""......nd he really deserves them.....i loved this movie.......in fact, i liked this movie more than ""The Dark Knight"".....this movie is a must must watch."
23650,False,"The first movie that I saw of this guy was Memento and I was so much thrilled that I couldn't sleep the whole night and then Batman revival follows through Batman Begins.... and I was wondering how can one get lucky all the time... but he again proved me wrong with Prestige. Then again i felt that this would be last.... but Dark Knight as the world knows overshadowed everything that the world had seen so far... And I said to myself wait a minute... this seems to be too much.... too good to be true... so I went to see Inception in fear mingled with excitement that this has to be a flop.. but my heart wanted it to be a good movie...and oh! my dear I couldn't believe what I saw... what I heard.. and what I experienced... and was so tremendously elevated by this supreme intelligent movie that i pinched myself to check if I'm in a real world or a dream world.... Simply the most magnificent movie of his era.. and the best was not the way Christopher Nolan thought.... but the way he could somehow managed to show in form of cinema... Truly a super class act... a Masterpiece.... Hats off to Nolan and brilliant acting by Leonardo-de-Caprio, Ellen Page and other supporting folks....."
23651,False,"I won't describe the plot, I won't describe the characters, I won't describe anything about this movie. You've seen advertisements for this movie. They are freaky, complex, mind-bending, but nothing in these advertisements make sense, and they won't until you actually see the film.Nevermind the visuals of the film. They are not even the most effective thing of this film. Granted though, they are a spectacular sight, and I never thought for one second I was looking at actual CGI. That's SUPER effective. Nevermind the acting in the film. However, I never once thought I was actually watching people act, I actually thought I was looking at something real. The most effective point of the film is an idea, an idea that takes our brains for a wicked little spin. This idea entertains us, intrigues us, and plays fun little games with us. It's a sheer delight.A lot of people are going to ask ""Is this film better than Nolan's The Dark Knight?"" In my personal opinion, yes. This is his best film, and it is better than ""The Dark Knight"", which was a masterpiece itself. I'm proud to say that ""Inception"" is a step up. For those who are looking for something simple, something plain, and something that won't require a grand extent of their brain power, they will get bored with ""Inception"". This is an adult film in the regard that it requires your full attention, and your brain must be plugged into it, or you are going to miss it ALL OF IT.I believe that this film definitely deserves a place for the ""Best Picture"" nomination at the Oscars this year, along with more recognition to Nolan as a director and a writer, for he has made the most original film I have probably seen in a very long time. His writing is impeccable. His direction is brilliant. His movie is the ultimate masterpiece.Inception is the smartest $160 million dollars that a studio has ever spent to make a film. It was also the best $7.50 I have ever spent. Bravo."
23652,False,"My feelings about this movie is probably best illustrated by the Southpark episode 'Insheeption', just because a film is complex, doesn't mean it's good or cool.Making a film more complex and multi-layered doesn't necessarily make it a deeper and more engaging film. In the case of Inception, it generally only makes it more complex, and not in a way that is to the film's merit.The complixity gets in the way of the film's plot a lot, which is quite frankly, not that complicated.I can only call the film, an overly complex, though decent film, that just insists too much upon itself. It's a decent film,and although graded equally on IMDb, it does not deserve to be amongst the likes of The Shawnshank Redemption and The Godfather."
23653,False,I think all the other 1 star voters stated exactly how I feel about this movie. I have never felt motivated to write a movie review in my life. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen! My favorite movie reviewer gave it 4/4 stars. I am baffled - - I really feel like I'm missing something... although there seem to be many out there that have the same thoughts I do. Thanks for confirming my opinions! I could tell within five minutes of the movie that I was not going to like it and that I wouldn't be able to follow it. Should have walked out then. I am the most sympathetic person to characters in a movie. I was amazed that I couldn't care less if all of the main characters were shot dead. There was zero character development. I felt a bit nauseous from all of the action and I really coudn't tell what was going on a lot of the time.
23654,False,"Inception is a movie that works outside our logic. We feel like our mind had been played all along, it's like the movie contains some puzzling, undeciphered codes scattered all over places. The moment we walk out theater, our mind process the movie, we interpret things, looking for many many possibility of answers over the questions we've just experienced. And this is why Inception works outside our logic; because no matter how hard we think and discuss this movie, we won't go anywhere. It's a decent analogy of a tricky labyrinth.Like a discourse that some elements - I would say some key - had gone missing, or simply were not even there at the first place, Inception is a piece that Christopher Nolan as a director creates and how he wanted it to be: To create questions in our head. While I think these questions aren't supposed to be vital, but this makes Inception special on a very intriguing level. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a thief who works with stealing another person's mind. He used a special method by letting himself into a person's dream, hence explored those dreams while in the same time took a very important information that those persons won't share to any one. Once, a billionaire named Saito (Ken Watanabe), whom supposed to be his victim, offered Cobb a very interesting idea about doing his work differently. Instead of stealing thoughts, Saito asked Cobb to plant idea, to incept something in a person's mind. The logic is - according to this movie - if it's possible to stole any thought, it would also be possible to embed a whole new idea into a person's subconscious.To make it all happen, Cobb needs to recruit a bunch of people with their specialty. There're Arthur (Joseph Gordon Levitt); a guy who always worked with Cobb all the time, Adriane (Ellen Page); a brilliant architecture student whom able to create dream's environment, Yusuf (Dileep Rao); a chemist whose drugs are able to provide a powerful sedative, and Eames (Tom Hardy); a forger who stands like an actor on every person's dream. These experts has one objective: to incept an idea into one mind: Robert Fischer Jr (Cillian Murphy).The film rolls with how these experts trying to deliver this inception. Later on the movie, we would have a perception about how complex and intricate this inception method is, and how dangerous a dream could be. Apparently Cobb is keeping a dark thought on his deepest subconscious, this one includes Cobb's two children and his former beautiful wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard). Mal has been disturbing Cobb's mind, it's almost impossible to get rid of her from his dream. Every time Mal appears, his work and life are in a great danger.Without giving too many spoilers, I would continue my review concentrating on how I perceive Inception holistically. Inception goes in a way that it looks very complicated and confusing, and it'll makes us believe that we have to think hard in order to understand anything this movie delivered. While the truth is, in my opinion, Inception is a complex-looking movie with a very simple concept underneath it. The movie looks very confusing at some point, and then later on it'd become clearer, and then it looked like it's very surprising and mind blowing at the ending scene, it's something that Nolan creates on purpose so the audience would think like they'd been mind-tricked.And that preceding paragraph would come to my early statement: Inception works outside our logic. No matter how 'ambiguous' the ending is, no matter how detail the script looks like, we as an audience simply won't solve this puzzle because Nolan won't let us do so. It's impossible to conclude a research if we miss some data, so to speak. I'm not implying that Inception is a waste of time, or saying that this is a movie that doesn't have a true meaning. On a contrary, Inception is a work of genius. Instead of making a movie that goes over every one head, Christopher Nolan produced something simple that would be taken very seriously with the audience.I believe, on the first 30 minutes of Inception, lots of people are trying too hard not to get lost. While the story is going to automatically solve its puzzles on the next two hours, we as the audience is preparing ourselves hard to understand it. Once the ending came, the movie ended, we felt satisfied and intrigued. We felt smarter. We opened our interpretations, threw some insights and reasons, while the truth is actually been there all the time. I myself don't count the ending as ambiguous, since to be ambiguous the story needs to support its ambiguity. And in my opinion, while there are hints here and there, it's not enough to make it ambiguous.We don't need an extra intelligence to understand this movie. What we need is to relax, throw away our preconceptions, and let the next two and half hours entertaining you on its own tricky way."
23655,False,"Overly long...could have easily had 30 minutes cut...and I would have given it a 7 at 2 hours of length. The first 90 minutes a bit slow in several parts (looking at my watch, shifting in my seat), but then it picked up. Overall, I would characterize it as a slower version of ""The Matrix."" The visual effects were stunning, the premise quite creative, the acting and direction excellent, and it likely employed enough CGI people to populate a small city.Some parts, however, were very hard to follow, esp. in the second half, although if you did pay attention you can get most of it. The absolute adulation it's getting is--and an overall number 3 on Top 250 IMDb.com--just inSANE! I think this is just a LOT of people wanting to be seen as cool and hip. But really folks...I enjoyed ""Toy Story 3"" more. I must give the weightlessness special effect special mention along with a fight scene with shifting gravity. Nicely done...All-in-all, there are worse ways to spend 2.5 hours...listening to an Obama speech, for example...See it soon if you want to be the first one on your block, but keep your expectations within reason and you won't be terribly disappointed."
23656,False,"To start off with the positive, I feel this film features a good cast of interesting and likable characters, interesting action and visual effects, and a story which is compelling and human despite the unusual setting (much of which takes place in a number of distinct dream worlds). Indeed, the movie features two central stories with emotional resonance, one regarding the tortured relationship of the main character Cobb (DiCaprio) with the memory of his late wife Mal (Cotillard), and the relationship of the industrial magnate Fischer (Murphy) with his seemingly distant and recently-deceased father. Cobb's assistant Arthur (Gordon-Levitt) especially shines in wildly creative scenes inside a dream-world where gravity has been suspended, and the young architect Ariadne (Page) serves the story well in two ways, both as an outsider to the world of dream thievery whose training helps to explain the premise of the movie to the audience, and as a person curious to get at the root of Cobb's relationship with Mal.The title ""Inception"" refers to the idea of implanting a thought in the dreaming mind of another person, and the central plot concerns a thought which the industrialist Saito (Watanabe) wants planted in the mind of Fischer, causing Fischer to break up his father's holdings. Members of Cobb's team seem skeptical about the feasibility of planting such a thought, but Cobb's tortured past has shown him that such inception is indeed possible. Powerfully motivated by the desire to see his children in America again, but constrained by authorities who believe he played a role in the death of his wife, Cobb agrees to help Saito because the latter can pull strings to get Cobb back to his home. As Ariadne discovers, though, Cobb's relationship with Mal ~ which remains very much alive in Cobb's subconscious ~ is a powerful danger to everyone who joins him in the mission.So the film does deliver on many levels, with good action, good characters, and a story compelling both intellectually and emotionally. However, I do feel the movie dragged in spots, ironically because overdoses of action can slow down a movie rather than help the pace. Also, despite the fact that the movie is largely about dreams, I felt that the dreams weren't very dreamlike. Part of that can be explained by Cobb's use of the architect Ariadne to construct settings for the dreams, but real dreams arise from a non-logical place in the brain, and I think anyone who has kept a dream journal can attest that real dreams have a surreal quality quite unlike the real world. That isn't to say that the dream worlds of ""Inception"" aren't spectacular in their own way, but I felt the dream worlds of this movie had more in common with the alternate reality of the Matrix in the ""Matrix"" movies than any dreams I've ever experienced. As in the Matrix, the Inception dreams present a world where physical laws can be bent or broken (to the advantage of skilled and knowledgeable people who are aware of the true nature of the world), but I suppose I was looking for more crazy, unexpected, non-logical content in the dreams. Since the movie is already challenging to follow, such content might make the movie too inaccessible to most audiences, but I still felt the director could have done more to cultivate a bizarre and dreamlike atmosphere.Still, all factors considered, I felt this was certainly a good movie at the very least, and probably worth your time if you're thinking about seeing it."
23657,False,"This review is being written by a 46 year-old guy. I mention this because clearly this is a film where age is important, as younger folks probably will enjoy the movie more--and can take the fast-paced action and frenetic pace. I assume older audiences probably will be a little less amazed and a bit overwhelmed with the film. Just something to consider as you read this.As for the movie, I'll be up front about the fact that I did NOT love this film. It's just not the sort of movie I'd usually see and only went because my oldest daughter nagged me to go. I am glad I did, however, as I really could respect the movie in many ways. First, the story is wildly original (though, also quite confusing). Other than the Matrix films, I can't think of anything that even comes close to it in style. Second, the production looked and sounded great. The music was intense and worked great with the amazing, totally amazing, special effects. Third, it was nice to see so many kid actors show that they are NOT light-weights and could act. Leonardo DiCaprio is no longer the pretty young thing he was in ""Titanic""--his maturity and grit were welcome. Also, seeing the kid from ""Third Rock"" suddenly playing an action hero was great--you'd barely recognize him--or the other grown child actors. Fourth, I loved the ending--it really pulled everything together very well.So why am I not giving the film a glowing review? Well, I am simply not an action film fan. And, the insane pace, TONS of shooting and crazy plot simply lost me at times. I much preferred the slower and more introspective moments of the film. Also, while Ken Watanabe is a fine actor, I had a devil of a time understanding a lot of what he said--to the point where I wish they'd either dubbed him or had caption! Now this is NOT just because I am an old crank who is slightly hard of hearing--my daughter, too, found his thick accent difficult. On the other hand, Ms. Cotillard was VERY easy to understand and I was surprised how well she controlled her lovely French accent.I could probably go on and on about the film--as it's long, complex and VERY prone to be one to watch and re-watch and discuss with friends. However, at this point, there are already a bazillion reviews and 7 billion people have already gone to see it, so I'll call it a day.Well worth seeing....but perhaps too frenetic and confusing for many."
23658,False,"Really, this was the worst movie I have ever seen. It was Sci-Fi at its worst - a thoroughly impossible idea unmitigated by any shade of Well, Maybe. And it was compounded by the fun ability of the movie-makers to cut and paste the scenes in an unconnected fashion, making a whole that is absolutely incomprehensible. This isn't brilliant, it is bizarre. It isn't entertaining, because certainly if you go for entertainment and have to spend the entire 2 hours and 28 minutes figuring it out you will feel cheated and bored, not entertained. How a movie like this gets so many high ratings is a mystery and makes me worry. Will all movies go in this direction? Maybe its a cult movie, maybe that's it. There is plenty of ""action"" (read, endless fights, car chases, etc.), and the sound track is Really Loud. At one point most of the characters are for some unclear reason in the same white space-like suits with white head gear that hides their faces. You see anonymous white suits battling it out. You go from Who's who? to Who cares? in a very short time. This is a great movie to go to if you generally spend your time in the movies texting or otherwise not paying attention. Miss this one if you can."
23659,False,"I went to watch it last night at a local Kino in Berlin motivated by the high rating this movie has in this same website. I was actually expecting something good, we were talking about Blade Runner (our benchmark) before watching it, dreaming it could get anywhere close to it. We were wrong The first 20 minutes of the film were OK, but after that the film revealed itself to be no more than a fast paced video-clip action film. The script is OK but has quite many flaws, the dialogs are so bad most of the time. It's like everything is not natural and the characters are forced to explain things and as we say in Spanish they use a shoehorn so the audience doesn't get lost I suppose. Nevertheless what they do is not that hard to understand and they could have simply done it in a way more clever way. The acting is extremely weak, if you are looking for the di Caprio from the aviator, departed, so on, forget about this film. I guess Leonardo did what he could with this piece of crap script they gave him. If this wasn't enough, the film has music playing behind almost the entire film, very common among the sci-fi action films of our time, maybe it's me, but I cannot stand techno music or whatever during the entire film. I guess you know what I mean. And last, the action, it has more action than needed. the last 45 minutes I was literally yawning and wouldn't have minded to leave the cinema. It was awful, gunshots, grenades, kicks and punches.... simply pathetic. Im sorry for Nolan, he made memento which is a great film and Dark Knight was also good, but this?¿ this is crap and if you like sci- fi and quality, waiting for a DVD release should be enough. What Im afraid is that all those 10 rating votes are from young people or something, who haven't seen much sci-fi or just think this is what sci-fi is supposed to be, nothing more distant from reality."
23660,False,"I saw this movie with a big group of 10. I would guess the group's rating might be an 8.5, very enjoyable! Personally I was one of the 2-3 least gripped maybe because I've seen too many movies. The 9.3 rating on IMDb is enthusiasm in a bubble. And bubbles do burst. Those mesmerized will vote this film as fun as a roller coaster - pop entertainment but no masterpiece. That said, it is best to compare this as one of the latest rides in Universal Studios theme park rather than belonging in the halls of cinema's greatest films. For pure entertainment, Inception gets a 8.5 in an IMAX theatre so it really helped when they talked about a ""kick"" and your seat gets a kick. Nolan tends to give us kicks for thought. Comparatively Nolan's Memento is a bit creative and the ending of the Prestige bizarrely entertaining and horrifying. In general, Inception has more firepower than either The Prestige or Memento. Its special effects and editing are exquisitely done and captivates the audience. So it is entertainment on high adrenalin.As a film, however, Inception is at times awkward and confusing. Perhaps that sets up the audience for the dreams. The reality check was the 747 and the totems the characters used. The script is generic and simple but there are psychoanalytic allegories. One of the screenwriters must have been a chess player since the whole mind game evolves from that and references to Robert Fischer, the prey of the mind criminals, could be mistaken for the American grandmaster. The idea of him seizing his father's empire (the chessboard and the desire to kill one's father, as in the Oedipus complex) is psycho-babble. Inception takes this theme subtly with the implicit use of Ariadne Ellen Page's pawn totem. The characters are all pawns in chess dream. We always speculate on dream control and whether falling means death. Much of the dream states are unimaginative clichés, however, the layering of them makes it interesting. Leonardo's last movie, Shutter Island, was a better blur between reality and fantasy. We see Inception as an intellectual challenge, but it is more a technical challenge which leaves the characters and the real story undeveloped. What is the real underlying story? I think it is Dorn Cobb's desire to reunite with his dead wife and with his children. In fact, given the brass top totem is not Dorn's (Leonardo's), but belongs to his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard), one wonders at the end whether it is a dream or not. The mind crime was a dream and the reality was an ordinary man traveling to visit his family after his wife dies. Note at the end, none of the characters acknowledge each other. The only person who recognizes Dorn is his father played by Michael Caine. One could argue that they are trying to keep anonymous as Fischer is present. Or perhaps Dorn dreamt up the whole movie and only the end is the real part.Nolan is a great technical director, the special efforts are great and not overdone, and the movie grips the audience much like a roller coaster. But the script is a bit spotty, the plot perhaps deliberately muddled and the emotional story of Dorn and his wife doesn't quite unfold. None of the actors except Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon- Levitt really make the best use of their roles. Leonardo was solid but he's had better performances. Michael Caine's role is innocuous, but quite charming. Marion Cotillard is effective and plays a significant role but perhaps we could see more of her. Nolan surpasses Memento but doesn't match up to the Matrix which still holds the lead for mind-bending action-scifi. Regardless, as Alfred Hitchcock raised the mystery to an art form, Nolan pushes the complex sci-fi thriller. In the end, he isn't quite a master as Hitchcock, but he remains one of the finer directors today."
23661,False,"Inception?Incomprehension is more like it.Techno-babble, psycho-babble, and just plain babble fill a third of the film, providing the audience with the rules of the game and the back story of the main character. Unfortunately, much of it is unnecessary and difficult to follow and takes the place of character interaction, character growth, and emotion. Inception is a gargantuan, cinematic meditation on dreams and reality. Zzzzzz. That's the sound of me snoring.The only thing worse than being bored at a film is being bored AND not giving a crap. And that's the case here. There's not a single character to care about. Oh sure there is a preponderance of cool effects, people hanging weightless in time and space and climbing on ceilings, but without a cohesive narrative or anyone to root for, they're just pretty images flashing on a big screen at a frenetic pace.Don't get me wrong, somewhere there is a good film here. Or at least there could have been. But as it stands it is a story not well told.Which is easier to explain: the plot of this film or the praise hefted upon it by critics and everyone else on this forum? Has Christopher Nolan risen to the level of Marty Scorsese and James Cameron where films are lauded despite whatever self-indulgent, effects-laden dreck they put on the screen?All throughout Inception I wanted to shoot myself so that I could wake up from this bad movie. Unfortunately my top stopped spinning and the reality set in: another lousy film in the Summer of 2010. Wake me when it's over."
23662,False,"Leonardo DiCaprio is on a 'good movie' streak. The Departed 9/10, Blood Diamond 9/10, Body of Lies 8/10, Shutter Island 8/10, Inception 10/10.I went to the midnight showing of Inception at my local theater, and it was jam packed. I had been waiting for this movie ever since I saw the first preview a few months back, and now it was finally time. The lights dimmed and a wave of ""shh!"" swept through the room. I prayed silently that Inception wouldn't disappoint. The movie began to play.The ocean. That's the first shot of this movie, and the last thing you see before Inception literally destroys every other movie that's come out in the past 10 or 15 years.Every actor in this movie is brilliant and no one is miscast. Every shot, every angle, every sequence of this movie is absolutely stellar. Every plot twist, every line of dialog is sheer genius. The pacing is perfect, and the story is destined to become a classic. Honestly, I have never been in this much awe of a film. The characters were engaging and had depth. You feel like you know each and every one of them, the suspense was awful (but in the best way possible). If I had to put the title of 'prefect' on any film, Inception would be it. It is literally flawless.I have never seen a movie that actually made me sit on the edge of my seat sweating and sipping on my Coke like a nervous wreck. I have never seen a movie where I literally wanted to jump into the screen and save one of the characters, I have never seen a movie that could make me want to cry one second, shout out in anger the next, and rejoice the next. That was the power of Inception.To say that this movie was good, or even great is a enormous understatement. This move was without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen in a cinema. Quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen. I am going to see it again today. I recommend you do the same.Final Word: Simply Perfect. 10/10."
23663,False,"Inception is the most innovative and creative film I've ever seen. THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER FREE! In fact, telling anyone a thing not known from a trailer ... well I'd feel like a jerk. Inception is about technology that can invade peoples mind for numerous reasons. Christopher Nolan ( Writer and Director ) goes above and beyond exploring the process, exploring the mind, and exploring the concepts, possibilities, and well... dreams.Everyone praises James Cameron as the master of visual effects and whatnot. After seeing Inception I'm inclined to believe that from everything but a technical standpoint, James Cameron can only dream of making visual effects that come even close to evoking the type and magnitude of emotions that Inception can. Inception is absolutely awe-inspiring in scope. it's not a summer blockbuster thrill-ride, or an emotional roller-coaster, it's the absolute best aspects of both. The script and acting are all phenomenal. Dicaprio gives not an only an Oscar worthy performance but his best performance ever. it's not all about Dicaprio though as he is surrounded by an ensemble cast with names such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, and many more. More importantly, their performances too are incredible. The original score by Hans Zimmer is as usual outstanding and amplifies the intensity and emotion within every scene. With and outstanding creative and innovative plot that's massive in scope with substance and a number of eye popping visual effects that will be forever planted in your mind, amazing direction and acting, and an amazing score, there is no reason not to watch Inception. Yes the story is very complex but at the same time everything that's important is easy to grasp. 2 views isn't necessary but it's worth it. hell, 10 views are worth it.Chris Nolan is no longer chasing directors like Kubrick, Tarantino, or Scorcese. Chris Nolan is now #1. Between Memento, The Dark Knight, and Inception, Chris Nolan is the greatest director of our time, one of the best ever, and one of the most important directors ever.Inception is simply one of the best films ever made and one of about 5-10 movies i'd ever give an absolute perfect 10/10"
23664,False,"I found this movie to be terribly boring and kept falling asleep trying to sit through it. The premise is ridiculous on every level and they try to make it seem clever by not explaining anything.The reason trippy things happen when you dream is because the brain is operating at such a low level that simple logic and common sense are not possible. Its not possible to deal with layers of complexity of the dreams within dreams, the visual world itself is well beyond the comprehension of an unconscious brain. Quite simply if your brains awake enough to deal with this world then you are very awake.Though the stupidest part is entering other peoples dreams by lying down next to them....i found that interesting...Even the thing about the chick from Juno being the architect and she wasn't even gonna go in with them. The premise appeared one of them would control/create the world from within the dream world which was meant to be her, yet she wasn't gonna be there...Worst big budget movie I've seen although I just saw Prometheus and that was pretty bad."
23665,False,"Good points. Well, the visuals were great that's for sure. The way they bent reality and had rooms spin and cities shift and stuff blow up, sure, great action. The soundtrack is good as well but it doesn't have any memorable tunes.Bad points. What the hell was that action all about? Projections of someone's mind were typical people attacking the incerptors. Am I to believe that the ultimate defense a person's mind has is... faceless mooks? Where are the dragons, the supermen, the giant robots? Something that is NOT faceless mooks? If this is the realm of dreams then it should be filled with such stuff, there is no holding back. Not even the most pragmatic mind would be without such stuff. So here I am watching an hour long action scene that is better fit for a James Bond film (minus the rotating rooms) than an adventure in the subconscious mind of troubled men. Makes little sense. Then the dialogues. Although the explanations around how the inception works were great and I did understand the concept, I found that it took a huge chunk of the duration. Half of the dialogues feel like the characters are indirectly explaining the theory to us. Something that they wouldn't since they are supposed to know such stuff and have no need to mention them.Good point. The story is indeed interesting and offers a concept around the blurring of reality that has never been offered exactly like this before.Bad point. The actual plot outside the interesting concept is mostly thrown away at shoot outs and explosions with random mooks that have nothing to do with a person's mind. If I dream something, I am the dream. Everyone is me, everyone acts like me, everything reacts like me. Yet the movie wants us to think our dream is like reality. I was not convinced that a dreamworld is so stiff. It was changing all right but the moment someone knows he is dreaming and doesn't wake up, he doesn't need to run or hide. He can mold everything where he stands and play it God. Thus the movie doesn't literally show how dreams work. It just gives you some nice ideas and wastes the rest in action scenes you can find even in a normal action movie.Acting... no good or bad points here. There are no prevailing characters for all I care. The idea and the action overshadow the actors. Di Caprio and the gang did their parts well but I still find it hard to believe that such an unstable personality that has his murderous wife chasing him in dreams would be allowed to go on in such delicate missions. It's like inviting Freddy Krugger to chop you to pieces while the world hangs at the edge of the cliff. Bad plot element.So is this movie good? In theory, yes. Action lovers and eggheads will love it. Scriptwritters may get some nice ideas from. But as far as I care it is NOT a masterpiece. It has too many convenient events, too much holding back, too much infodump, too much out-of place action.Things that I would change to make this movie better: -No shootings with faceless mooks and blowing stuff just for the heck of it. -More dream morphing scenes in places of fore-mentioned pointless action. -Less infodump. -Less corny dead wife drama. We have Solaris for that.The Cage is a movie doing a rather better portrait of a man's dreamworld. Not so much mambo jumbo around how it works but shows it better. And of course there is Solaris (dead wife thing) and Matrix (cool action) and James Bond (shooting and blowing stuff) to take out most other good parts of the movie. By the end of it, only the idea of inception is what stands out. And it wasn't exploited that much really."
23666,False,"I confess I saw this flick at the theater the day it was released because I had seen the trailers and believed all the hype.Its been a while since seeing the movie, here is what I remember. Its full of amazing special effects, and begins well and I remember feeling that it was going to be a wonderful movie. However, I left disappointed and angry that my hard earned money had been wasted. Who the heck voted for this garbage movie to be on this list of ""Best Movies of all time??? Morons who haven't seen any of the hundreds or thousand of better movies than this polished pile of fecal matter. The plot is too slow, there's too much emphasis on special effects, and although the concept is somewhat original the movie could have been so much better had the dialogue/dialog been more interesting and believable. Maybe, I am in the minority, I just hate this movie, and I don't like that fact that its gets so much praise! Do you people really think this is one of the best movies of all time? It should not even be in the top 100 much less the top ten!Don't see this movie. It's 128 minutes too long with only 2o minutes that is actually worth watching! Don't waste your time with this garbage.Do something more productive like reading a book, clipping nose hairs, vacuuming a beach... anything other than watching InceptionGood Grief!"
23667,False,"This is just an average big budget Hollywood movie.Don't expect any complexity or depth from it, it is simple and quite shallow.Technically it's well done, the plot is OK, the actors are fine, the FX are good and hopefully you will have a good time watching the characters running and jumping around, ducking bullets and explosions and so on while a VERY SIMPLE AND QUITE SHALLOW psychological-scifi plot unfolds.But you won't get much else from it.I'm giving it a 7. So folks, don't believe the hype about this thing being a fascinating and revolutionary piece of art, because IT'S NOT. It's just another Hollywood commodity out to make big bucks. If you want some enlightening psychology read ""?"" and don't watch this, for ***ck's sake.There are some really cool effects to this film, but the story is so convoluted that it detracts away from the story."
23668,False,"Inception takes the concept of dreaming and turns it into a movie, however its not done as creatively as something like ""eternal sunshine of a spotless mind"". Looking past that there was good potential for character development, but really the only character who even feels remotely developed is the main one. I was loving the first 20minutes of this movie, but after it explained all the rules, instead of doing something creative with it, it just squared it, literally, dreams within dreams within dreams. And Inception turned out to be nothing but an OK action movie that found legit excuses to make half the footage in slow motion. In addition i did despise how the hype with the main characters wife was set up for some epic encounter and then rewarded our attention with just a melodramatic conversation in the end. On the other hand it did offer some splendid effects, but like all movies with such effects, they have nominal value, and as time passes,their real value diminishes.This movie deserves a 6-7 and nothing more."
23669,False,"The effects were excellent, but all the best ones were in the trailer. Without going into spoiler mode I'll just say I expected the effects to have more meaning than they did and I expected them to be used better. The acting was good, the plot understandable in a single viewing if you pay attention but it seems like it's trying too hard to be complex/dynamic/intricate. It may make you laugh out loud at how silly some of the logic is as it twists upon itself and changes but again I won't go into specifics - you'll see. Worth a download? Sure, you might love it as many seem to (over 9 score at this time)...that or someone figured out how to game the IMDb rating system."
23670,False,"I enjoyed it. It wasn't excellent, it wasn't dreadful; maybe just above average, but definitely not a 9.1.I actually looked forward to DiCaprio's performance, as he's a great actor. However, I was somehow disappointed; he hasn't convinced me at all, and sometimes I felt the part was not made for him. I'm also a big fan of Michael Caine, whose performance I only thought of as average.I admit the idea of the movie was intriguing, but the plot was way too complicated, without being complex.The movie is worth seeing, but is not worth a 9.1, or to be called a masterpiece."
23671,False,"When the film ended, the 18-year old boys start to clap and whoop like they'd just had a religious experience. It reminded me of when I went to Swordfish in the theater years ago with a really hot but REALLY dumb blonde. When that movie ended, she clapped and whooped because she was SO SMART and got it. Unfortunately, there was no post-film alcohol or busty blonde to dull the pain of this evening's experience. In my opinion, Insomnia was Nolan's only good film, and it was really the performance by Pacino that grabbed me. Nolan is a talented version of M. Night Shyamalan, i.e. the Kings of the Twist Ending. This is a pseudo compliment. I don't think Nolan is brilliant nor a great filmmaker. This movie didn't scream intelligence, though it really tries. In addition to making Nolan even more wealthy, I hope the side benefit of this film's success is studios taking on more high budget pet projects that aren't designed to sell happy meals or sequels. Please PLEASE let this be the side benefit to Inception."
23672,False,"Are you kidding me? All this fawning? Just because you don't understand it does NOT mean it's genius. I took my two friends to the packed screening and in the middle of it we all looked at each other truly baffled. Is THIS what all the buzz was about? Overwrought, longgg, confusing and as much as I love Ken Watanabe could you have at least done a take or two where you could actually understand him? Yes, there are a few positives to this thing (Leo is almost always great, and Ellen Page is refreshingly for once not doing her ""Hard Candy"" role) but gawwwwd Chris Nolan is on his truly on his way to becoming the next Shyamalamadingdong. Somebody please tell him to tone it down and focus."
23673,False,"My first IMDb review. Well... My thoughts are so fragmented it's difficult to write a coherent review. This film is so wrong on so many levels, it's hard for me to contain myself. The rating and reviews are proof of nothing but one thing, society is now dumb. That may sound harsh, but after thinking my way through the childish attempt to delve into existentialism, the moral bankruptcy, the flat characters, the attempt at creating 'cool' then that is the decision I've reached.It failed to deliver on every single level, even the special effects were so in-your-face that even they became irritating (Surely if an entire street is both below, and above you simultaneously, wouldn't it go a bit dark?).If you want a high concept film then rent Primer, if you want a film to make you think, rent Waking Life or Fight Club, if you want excitement, rent The Bourne Identity or something, anything, just please don't see this film, unless you've never ever ever questioned the reality around you, and you're thick, then maybe you should see it... Arrrgggghhhhh.To sum up a large part of the ""concept"" of this ""masterpiece"", here's Inception without wasting your time and money.""The great Taoist master Chuang Tzu once dreamt that he was a butterfly fluttering here and there. In the dream he had no awareness of his individuality as a person. He was only a butterfly. Suddenly, he awoke and found himself laying there, a person once again. But then he thought to himself, ""Was I before a man who dreamt about being a butterfly, or am I now a butterfly who dreams about being a man?"""
23674,False,"That's what Leonardo DiCaprio was shouting at me for months from all those trailers and previews (there wasn't many of them) and he was right I wasn't prepared for this awesome, mind-blowing experience.Finally I have seen the most anticipated movie of this year (for me) and I know you are all excited for this movie so I try do describe the movie without giving away too much of the plot. The story tells of Cobb who is a extractor, someone who enters human minds through their dreams he and his team create and steals valuable information from the subject's mind. He is a wanted fugitive in the U.S.A, which is a problem for him, because he's got kids there and coming back home to them is what he most desires. During his last assignment he meets a mysterious Japanese businessman, who doesn't ask him of extraction but an inception, planting an idea in someone's mind and that is much more complicated. So Cobb sets out to recruit a team and finish this last job alive.All the actors here do an outstanding job; Leonardo Dicaprio is at his best in this movie, Marion Cottilard does an excellent job as ""The Shade"", Ellen Page, one of the prettiest young actresses of today, is always great. Tom Hardy plays here the character with the right bad-ass attitude, they should offer him more roles like this.The biggest surprise for me was Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur, never seen a movie with him he surprised me how charismatic he is and how great he pulled off the role of Arthur.If you think the soundtrack from Hans Zimmer in The Dark Knight was unbelievable then wait for this one, I have to go and call this The Best Soundtrack of the Year.This movie features one of the best movie fights ever where Arthur is fighting one of the subconscious' defenses and the gravity is always changing. That fight is just so breathtaking and suspensive. It's just a like Ariadne says ""It's pure creation"".The movie is just so brilliant, it works on many levels. It's suspensive, mysterious, filled with action, the visuals are breathtaking, there is the typical blockbuster/Nolan humor in it too. Christopher Nolan is once again playing with the mind of the audience and until the end you don't know what's going to happen and you don't even know after the end. That's the beauty of it Nolan lets the viewer interpret the ending by himself. Nolan made this masterpiece, this modern day classic and it's a one hell of a ride and it's one hell of mind-blower.If you think about it, Nolan has planted an idea in your mind which you will be thinking about for months."
23675,False,"Inception was okay, it was well produced and directed and kept my attention throughout, so that's why I give it a 7 instead of a 6.Having seen the trailer, I went into it expecting a mind bending movie with a dreamlike script, but instead it's basically a puzzle movie with lots of run-of-the-mill shoot-em-up action. You do leave the movie with a heightened sense of awareness, but not with a different viewpoint on the world.I never cared that much for any of the characters, which is unusual for me - I often end up crying or otherwise being involved, so in that respect Inception seemed rather shallow. I kept trying to generate care, waiting for the arc of the script to take me over into the next level, but that point in the script never came.Technically, the special effects are pretty good, though they're kind of a one trick pony, or maybe a two trick pony. I was expecting much more in this regard. Sure, when I'm in a dream it seems real to my mind, but there are usually some really strange aspects too, like people whose faces are unclear, or like trying to speak but not being able, or like changing geography, or really weird, crazy stuff. None of this kind of thing happens in Inception, except for the occasional alteration in gravity.The basic idea, of never being sure what's real or what's constructed in your mind, has been done before. There's nothing wrong with that, since it's impossible to come up with new ideas about the human condition. But Rod Serling wrote some more compelling 30 minute TV scripts on the subject many years ago.My review makes it sound like a bad movie, which it is not, it's good enough. I guess I'm just reacting to incredible hype of people who think it's the greatest movie ever made. It certainly does not deserve a 9.4 rating, which is what IMDb is giving it as of this writing."
23676,False,"I really appreciate that the negative reviews for this film capture its most horrific quality: making people feel smart for understanding a stupid concept.If you showed this movie to a surrealist/dadaist, they would in fact find it incredible: how could so many people find this interesting, or even worth talking about? I've heard more inventive ideas from 5-year-olds than this.Do dreams even work like ""Inception""? No. No. No. God no.This is a psychologist's nightmare. Is this also why the American public have such dreadfully low emotional intelligence? Yes, dreams could be free of things like physical laws, but they are so much more meaningful than ""wee, I can fly!"" Besides gravity, all laws of reality are broken in dreams: people morph into other people, or multiple people can be the same person at the same time, or you can be both yourself and another person. Your bedroom could be your bedroom at one moment, and then also become a prison cell at the same time - and even then, sometimes there's no notion of time at all! The point is that these ""images"", ""feelings"", ""characters"" are driven by emotion, or your brain finally being able to connect 2 things together without pesky reality getting in the way. ""The world is blue like an orange.""Inception literally un-trains the viewer from relating to his/her dreams intelligently. Rendering the amazing experience of dreaming through film is a huge challenge, and so many directors have done it much better justice than this piece of garbage."
23677,False,"I don't get it, I have read a lot of the reviews at the top of the list and I am starting to think I saw a worse movie than everyone else in a dream?!?!The plot I saw was weak with a lot of misdirection to make the movie seem more intelligent then it really was. Don't get me wrong, the special effects were awesome but to me the plot was misleading and thin at best. A dream, in a dream, in a dream? Yes it is as stupid as it sounds! For me it takes a lot more then special effects to make a movie! I just wish people were a little more honest when they were reviewing this movie. Maybe people who didn't really actually understand the movie rated it higher so they would feel smarter and better about themselves? Not the worst movie I have ever seen but definitely not a 9+ rating!It's anybody's guess."
23678,False,"Style over Substance might be a Knee-Jerk Negative Reaction to this Messy Film. But that would be Kind. There is no Style or Substance to Waste many Brain-Cells Considering. The Movie's Conceit is to make You want to Think. Think Not.It tries so Very Hard with its Explanations about Dreams (don't do a drinking game taking a shot every time the word dream is mentioned, you will be dead by intermission). Also Wordy, Incomprehensible Insertions about the Teams ""Method"" used here to Infiltrate and Control the Minds of Corporate Clients (now there is a group we can morally support).This is so Unnecessarily Complicated that it causes Viewer Fatigue, and by Proximation Sleepiness, early on and Waking Up or Recovering from that is not a Given. The Result is just not Caring about Anyone or Anything that is happening on the Screen. What is happening is kind of Drab and Dull for a Dreamscape.If you buy the Premise and go along for the Ride, better fasten your Seat-Belts because it is anything but Smooth. It Bumps and Jumps from Dream to Dream and Layer upon Layer of Intellectual Gobbledygook that is so Very Uninteresting and Without much Pathos. The Music is forever in Swelling Mode and Ripples throughout and is Pretentious and Intrusive.In the End, some have trouble making it that far, there is a ""you decide"" Twist that is not really a Twist because, after all, You Decide. But it is hardly Worth it and when all is Said and Done, too much has been Said and not enough has been Done. Vastly Overrated."
23679,False,"There's something very important to note about this movie, and what a watchers opinion might be of it before almost anything else is said. And that is to consider whether the person watching it is a fan of other mind bending sci-fi stories to begin with.The reason for this is, Inception is not a great mind bending story questioning the nature of reality. But it is a very accessible one. ""Questioning the nature of reality"" is not a huge sub-genre of science fiction, and the most notable author of it's kind, Philip K. Dick, has often been criticized as something of a hard read for a general audience.But for fan's of Dick, or mind bending movies such as The Nines, there's just not too much to get into in Inception. For it's genre it's a rather basic idea, laid out as clearly and often as possible to make sure everyone's following along. For those that were engaged by say ""Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said"" then the idea, which is central to enjoying the movie, will probably seem workaday, unoriginal, and a bit boring.And that right there is the crux of whether you like this movie. Because without the idea, without the science fiction behind it, much of the rest of the movie reveals itself to be workable, but not overly remarkable. Certainly the camera work and sense of style is unique and quite entertaining. But the actual plot, of breaking into a man's mind to plant an idea, feels a bit bereft. The only thing ""at stake"" is a man returning to his family, a family we never actually get to see him interact with directly, and so doesn't have the impact it could. Nor is there any real villain involved, and so no one to root against either.Nor is the action particularly inspired nor very well filmed. The one exception, of course, is the short but rather spectacular altering gravity fight. But beyond this three minute sequence Nolan's inability to actually concentrate the camera on the action happening is repeated again and again. Grenades are thrown, and we get a bang and cloud of smoke off to the side, mostly obscured. When the characters shoot guns, that's mostly what they do, we rarely get to see what their effects are unless it's highly obscured and off to the side. Nolan always keeps the camera solely on the characters, never on the results of their actions, nor are the characters usually doing much more than shooting at half seen ""bad guys"".When the characters have more to do, such as in a brief on foot chase or the above altering gravity scene, the action is good. But the majority is just the uninvolving action of killing half visible at most baddies with no character nor emotional impact. And considering there's a lot of action at times, that steals a lot of screen time.So, Inception is either a great sci-fi idea that you've not been introduced to, or an average movie with a sci-fi idea that you've seen done much better elsewhere."
23680,False,"This movie has been praised by many people and it's very motivated to ask why? Good science fiction puts you in a state of mind that makes you think ""there's a chance that this actually can happen."" That's not the case with this film, and that's why it fails. Even the Terminator movies are more believable than this flick, i mean time travels has been discussed for a very long time and advanced robots exists today, even if there aren't any Terminators to be seen...yet.Christopher Nolan has made several great movies, i would say all of his movies are great in some aspects. Inception is a very creative effort to say the least. But I seriously wonder if he wasn't stoned when he wrote the script? The good guys are sedated, then connected and then they get inside someones head - a person who is also connected to the same neurological network that connects the good guys. Inside the mind of that person they try to steal ideas or as in this case implant them. Already here Chris should have given it a second thought, but it gets worse...The good guys carry weapons just in case the person they're trying to steal from or make an implant in, have a defense. Because if he or she has, the defense guys will shoot at you. Paus...well armed guys defending ideas inside someones head? What? The good thing is that if you get hit you won't die, unless you are to deep down...to heavily sedated that is. Oh...but before you can get inside someones head an architect must draw the landscape in which the dream sequence will take place. What??? The film is of course enjoyable, it definitely has its merits. But it's NOT the masterpiece some thousand or so morons have claimed in this forum, it's not even close.Batman Begins and The Prestige are his best efforts so far with Memento very close."
119033,True,"Inception left me a lukewarm feeling.It was beautiful, I mean, visually, there is nothing to say to Nolan, the Inception has a wonderful picture, stunning visual effects and a vast diversity of decors.The actors were good, though I can't say that any performance blew me away. They did their job convincingly, but it didn't do much for me.Unfortunately, I didn't really connect with the characters, and didn't feel much invested with their mission, which as an effect prevented me from really bothering if yes or no Leonardo's character is still sleeping or nor (which is what the spinning top at the end is suggesting, I guess).Besides, what really drew me far, far away from the story was the length of the movie. The sequence where the van falls in the water at the end with all dreams imbricated one with an other was too long and, in the end, bored me to death.All in all, interesting movie, but I couldn't personally enjoy it as much as I wanted."
119034,True,"I sat there in the dark when the last shot transitioned to blackout followed by the first credit appearing: ""DIRECTED BY CHRISTOPHER NOLAN."" And I didn't have the same or even remotely similar sinking feeling followed with audible laughter I did back when I saw ""Memento"" with its famous closing line. I know you cannot re-invent the wheel, but why-- why does everybody have a h#@$-on for everything this man does? ""The Dark Knight."" ""The Prestige."" Is anybody going to ever tell this man that he's not Stanley Kubrick? Or does he surround himself with yes-men the same way that George Lucas does? He hasn't graduated from the James Cameron School of Arrogance yet (hoping that he never attends). I didn't think that this was a bad film- it wasn't a typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood drecks you see weekly, but it wasn't that good either. Even though Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report"" started to lose its way towards the end, it was more entertaining and THOUGHT-PROVOKING at times than this. I won't even get into the plot since so many other posters already have, and I know I'll be shot down for voicing any more criticisms over this ""masterpiece,"" but I hope-- I REALLY, REALLY hope that Christopher Nolan will make another ""Memento"" again. Maybe even a sequel, but no more ""Inception""s please."
119035,True,"""Inception"" is for sure, an extremely original movie with a very professional cast and a wonderful photography direction. The background sound is phenomenon, it helps the suspense and the pacing of the movie. But what's the matter of all these things, when the film is extremely uninteresting and confusing? Christopher Nolan has this problem. I can easily compare this one to ""Memento"". Both have the same good things, but fill me with boredom and lack of interest, so I wasn't able to watch either films to the end. Maybe Nolan should let someone write his movies and he only directs; that would make them much better. Do not even consider seeing ""Inception"" if you didn't like ""Memento"", period."
119036,True,"Noway deserves 9/10. The film has left too many things to ones imagination. The Plot could have been better. Could not understand the End. May be need to watch again to fully understand the movie. Not a must watch movie, can't be in TOP 250 Movies list. It will make you feel like scrambled egg. can give at most 5 for Picturization and Acting. Don't Expect much and you will still be better than watching with high entertainment expectation. I would rate King of Persia/StarTrek/Sherlock Holmes/Salt/Ramona and Beazus/UP/Matrix in recent Movies 8* compared to this.There must be panel of people asked to rate it hight to make it 9*. So don't get in Hurry to watch this movie. You can have better options."
119037,True,"Films are fictions of a director, based on a story. The story may be an existing story (a book, a true story) or pure fantasy; a film should always have a meaning, worth watching and must relate to the logic, to the reasoning of the viewers. To make films more interesting and challenging for the experienced viewer, directors may use different techniques like reversing or mixing the chronological sequence of scenes and temporarily confusing the viewer with dream scenes. These techniques should not be used just to make the movie more 'difficult' or more 'intellectual'; they should add an artistic value to the story. If you'd take away these 'tricks', you should still have left a solid story. 'Inception' is a bit different in the sense that the dream technique is maybe more important than the story. Maybe it is the story. Here the dreams are deliberately directionally started by an obscure apparatus in a suitcase and some wires, dreams that function on different levels or layers, each with some logical, preponderant illogical characteristics, but all very realistic, confusing dreams and reality; not only for the viewer, but also for the characters. That's the good part. The bad part is that the logic of the story is completely lost. We are watching a pudding of in itself highly attractive action scenes on different dream levels, in strange ways interacting with themselves. The actions are the results of what the principle characters dream up, we guess. Then why so much fuzz, so much bustle, and why not dream up a less complicated and less violent way to find your wife and children, which are dead, alive or only exist in you dreams? Dreams are uncontrollable, you might say. That is true, but the essence of this movie is, that the dreams in this movie are controllable. That is why this movie is not honest and does not touch your feelings. It is just a sequence of impressive actions, served with an intellectual intended sauce of dream states which after some researching do not make a lot of sense. My idea is that the high reviews on the IMDb-site have to do with viewers that are accustomed to video games, which use these concepts of complicated means of finding the solution or goal. For them it is all about the game, not about logic, reasoning and films that move you."
119038,True,"First off, this is indeed a really good movie, probably the best I have seen this year. I can't wait to buy it on Bluray and watch it over and over. However, let's not kid ourselves, it falls very short of masterpiece/all time classic status.When you think of this genre of movie, you can't help but think of The Matrix. That was a masterpiece in my opinion. And you can't help but draw comparison between these two films for many reasons, including the character of Arthur being made up to look like Neo and even having his wooden characteristics, not to mention that Arthur is in a scene obviously borrowed (cough, cough, stolen) from The Matrix's subway fight scene. What I love about The Matrix is how its universe is well explained and there's a solid logic behind everything. Notice I didn't say ""perfect"". You can go back and watch the movie and it all ties in together nicely. On the other hand, ""Inception"" explains the rules of its universe to the audience (quite a lot in the beginning) and I kept finding myself rolling my eyes and thinking, ""that's convenient"". Worst example is the ""projections"". Without these characters conveniently chasing people around, a lot of the story goes down the toilet, but the logic behind their actions is simply non existent. Another one is this whole thing about the ""kick"". Sure, gravity can wake you up from a dream. If you fall while asleep, your body will feel it and you will wake up. But please, to suggest that this concept would just magically work in a dream within a dream, within a dream is just ridiculous. There's the illusion of gravity in dreams, but no actual gravity, so wtf?Then there are a lot of things not even explained. How does Cobb's dad spot someone who would be able to build multi level sets in a dream really well? Why does the chemist come along in the dream? You would think a strong action type guy would greatly advance the mission more so than a geek who doesn't add anything inside the dream. Why did Fischer go as far as to get training for fighting people who could invade his dreams, which means he fears his enemies, YET he has no problems getting on a ten hour plane ride BY HIMSELF!!!!! I was also bothered by two other things that do not belong in a movie that wants to be labeled as a ""classic"": 1) Ken Watanabe is a good actor, but for the love of all things holy, can someone get this guy better English tutors? His English is worst than Jackie Chan's!!! You can tell he's saying something extremely crucial to the plot, but you can't understand any of it! 2) I know that a lot of action movies (yes, including The Matrix) take liberties with scenes featuring a shoot out. You always see the bad guys shooting away at the good guys at infinitum, yet not a single scratch on the good guys. We have now almost come to expect that in action movies, sadly. However, Inception abuses this concept beyond any reason. Bad guys empty machine guns within two feet of the good guy's vehicles, you see the bullet holes everywhere, YET, not a single scratch on anyone, except for one bullet. I don't mind suspension of disbelief for a good movie (which this is), but it got so bad that I was beginning to take it personal that a movie would try to insult my intelligence that much.You will have a good time watching this movie, but like they said in South Park, just because there are a lot of twists, doesn't mean it's intelligent, and it's definitely not a masterpiece."
119039,True,"I have to admit  I did completely fall for the hype. Given the complete secrecy surrounding Christopher Nolan's latest offering prior to its release, the extremely promising trailer, and the incredibly over-the- top-and-fawning initial reviews, I really thought we had another The Dark Knight on our hands.And now it feels like I have a rare disease  some infection of the senses that has prevented me from soaking in the supposed ""awesomeness"" that is Inception. I don't know what the exact ratio is, but I think I'm the one unlucky soul in every one thousand, that one lame boy who missed out on the land of dreams promised by the Pied Piper of Cinema. Not that I didn't enjoy watching it at all  in fact, I went for it a second time, but mostly because there was so much of it that I didn't get the first time. The second viewing did help  as did the millions of plot theories available online that attempted to fill in the gaps  but, to borrow from that common (and dreaded) appraisal parlance, I really didn't get that WOW effect.Some of the blame lies with my expectations  I was certainly expecting (aliens on) the moon from it. But I think it also has something to do with the fact that the film was way too focused on its myriad puzzles for me to feel any genuine connect, empathy, sympathy, hatred and/or wonder (I'm obviously thinking of you, Heath Ledger; RIP!) for any of its characters. Take Dom Cobb for example. For a man whose wife has committed suicide, implicated him for it, and penetrated his dreams to drive him almost to the edge of insanity  not to mention (seemingly) separated him from his kids forever  he seems remarkably in control (apart from the odd freight train crashing through his plans). So much so that when he hesitates to shoot Mal at a critical point in the narrative, his indecision seem almost laughable (and extremely contrived) given how assured he is the rest of the time.Not that I'd blame DiCaprio for it  he's already won me over in a very similar role in the much more fascinating Shutter Island, where he gets his man-on-the-edge act just right to create a really haunting portrayal. Nopes, all that restraint is purely Nolan's fault.And then there's the bit about a film with 5-6 good guys  where the hell are all the bad guys dammit? How exactly do I feel that sense of fear, that sense of the stakes being really high, if all I can see is a bunch of gun-toting dummies just waiting to be shot? Heck, even the worst that can happen to these guys is only described in the vaguest of ways as being stuck in a 'limbo'  and then towards the end we're shown that it's possible to even retrieve people from such a state, which just makes me feel that I was cracking my head to figure out the danger for a good two hours for no reason whatsoever. And I don't like being made to feel that way.Even if I'm totally wrong about the logic of this, I don't care  if I want to rack my brains out, I'll go take CAT, instead of paying 500 bucks (+200 for the food and popcorn courtesy my better half) to have my brains liquefied and oozing out of my nostrils. If not for the fascinating premise, and the genuinely innovative weightless sequence with Joseph Gordon-Levitt (and a really funny line from Ken Watanabe which I won't mention because it's the only bit of comic relief in the entire film), I might just have come away entirely disappointed.And yes, while it may be true for the freight train, you have to be kidding me if you say you didn't see that end coming from miles away."
119040,True,"I had heard this movie was mind bending. It is always a risk to watch something that has been hyped up to be an intellectual masterpiece....because generally nothing will live up to your expectations.As others have stated, the ending was predictable, and several plot and dialogue elements seemed too contrived and banal. But for all that, it was a creative and entertaining thriller.Personally, I thought Blade Runner was more thought provoking and Memento more innovative.Maybe the problem is that I have seen so many of the movies from which this film seems to draw inspiration that Inception did not strike me as terribly original or thought provoking.Anyway, it was entertaining. Definitely worth a watch."
119041,True,"Of all the glowing reviews and heaped criticisms this movie has brought about, few ever mention the moral questioning that goes with the subject matter. Is it morally OK to 'invade' another persons sub-conscious and implant the idea of breaking up their inherited multi-national corporation, just so your own multi-national corporation can monopolise the gap left? No, clearly it isn't. The idea that this plot is somehow entertaining for the viewer and not deeply uncomfortable to watch is thoroughly disturbing.In a decade or so, when the gleam has been rubbed from this movie, I hope future generations can distinguish the difference between a fantastical set of dream sequences, à la '8 1/2', and in the case of 'Inception', a truly frightening nightmare."
119042,True,It's an okay ride but come on! Towards the end it was like the director was aiming to make the most complex scene in cinema history. If I was to explain where everyone was in Cillian Murphy's mind and what they were trying to do it would take like 15 minutes. I give this film points for trying to be original but the climax was so unbelievably complex it made my head throb. And the very last moments of the very last scene tempts the viewer to think this may have been a dream all along which would be kind of lame. I believe it would have been a better ending if they had extended the ending a few seconds (tempting the viewer into wondering if it was a dream) and then ending it in a way that the viewer knew that it was reality (sorry if that is way too vague but people who have seen it will know what I'm talking about). If I watch it again I may have a better opinion of it but I view it right now as little more than an okay ride.
119043,True,"I came into Inception with very high expectations. I'm a huge fan of sci-fi thrillers; Philip K. Dick might be my favorite author, and I love films that raise metaphysical questions in a science fiction context. I've liked a lot of Nolan's stuff (Memento was terrific, Insomnia was pretty good, The Prestige was mediocre, and both of his Batman's were entertaining). I consider myself very good at following along with complicated plots. The movie had gotten terrific reviews already. It seemed like a slam dunk.At about the half-way point, I couldn't decide whether or not Inception was closer to Avatar (mind blowing visuals, mind numbing plot/dialog) or Fight Club (wildly overrated pseudo-intellectual drivel). Whichever one it's closer to, I cannot understand why so many people think that this is a good movie? Nolan takes a clever premise, if not a particularly inventive one, and creates an indecipherable, wildly inconsistent, and soulless film.That is not to say there aren't some redeeming qualities. As I noted before, the premise is pretty clever. The cinematography is really terrific, and a lot of the sets are visually stunning (especially the final scene in the Alps). The score was well put together and was not in the least bit overbearing, the acting was solid, and the editing was crisp and well thought out.The actual plot and dialog, however, are abysmal. I'm willing to suspend disbelief and go along for the ride. I'll play along with the fact that people are apparently capable of forming incredibly vivid and complex dreams when under the influence of a sedative, despite the fact that sedatives almost always prevent people from dreaming. I'll even disregard the fact that no real reason is ever given for why the characters in Inception are able to dream together, outside of a what looks like an old Simon Says toy in a briefcase with a bunch of wires running out of it.But that's just the beginning. For some reason, the ""architect"" of the dream is able to control the design and layout of other peoples dreams. How? Your guess is as good as mine. The forger (the always awesome Tom Hardy), is capable of impersonating other people in dreams (even though he looks like himself to members of the team), without any further explanation except for his name. And even though the architect seems to be the only person capable of designing the dream, all of the members in the dream are capable of allowing their subconscious to infiltrate the design. This seems like a rather cheap plot device, as it is only the main character who's subconscious makes any serious intrusions into the dream world, as if none of the other characters have serious psychological demons of their own.There are many other plot holes that I won't get into, but suffice it to say this movie is really a head scratcher, and not in a good way. The dialog is rather silly, and the supporting characters are completely one dimensional and exist only, it seems, to help advance the plot. When confronted with the tremendous revelation that people are actually capable of sharing dreams together, manipulating them, and that this is done routinely in corporate espionage, the budding architect Ariadne treats these revelations as somebody who just saw a particularly cool magic trick. In one particularly laughable seen, Michael Caine's character greets the arrival of his son, wanted for his wife's murder and on the lam from powerful multinational corporations seeking to kill him, with little fanfare or concern, pausing to only briefly chastise him about the abandonment of his children, and then accepting at face value a ridiculous scheme to clear his name, even offering up one of his top pupils to help.This movie was really a disappointment, mainly because it had such great potential. Instead fleshing out the clever premise with well developed characters, and deep, nuanced questions, Nolan bounces back and forth, making up more and more ridiculous rules and twists that govern his dreamworld. This is a very superficial production; it's the epitome of all sizzle and no steak. By the end of the film, I didn't even care enough to be disappointed by the classic non-ending. What a waste."
119044,True,"When I saw the trailer for ""Inception"" months ago, I thought I want to see this because I like all of the Christopher Nolan movies I've seen. Needless to say I was happy to not have co-parenting duties this weekend as my 12 year old daughter would not have wanted to see this movie. I digress. I saw it this morning and thought I need to see this again even if I have to drag my kid to see it. It was that good. Story is always paramount with Nolan and that is why I call him the Pixar of directors. He recruits the best actors and gets the best performances from them. Leo was great and Joe G Leavitt is the perfect wing man; he's becoming ""the actor's actor"" because he's so good in supporting roles. Michael Kaine had very limited screen time, but used it well as he's done in all of his Nolan movies. And the women (Ellen Page, Marion Cotillard) were strong characters who were not reduced to eye candy. Hans Zimmer gave me some music for the gym. I've never said that about an instrumental movie soundtrack.As I wrote in the summary, I wanted to read what people said who didn't like it. And for the life of me, it seems to be people wanting to be contrarian. It's almost like, ""I can't like this movie because other people tell me how great it is!"" The movie had something for everyone. Action, suspense, drama, love, thrills; you name it, it had it. The only remote complaint is that some of the story elements and plot lines were being explained as the movie was building to a climax. But IMO, that's why you see a movie again. I remember the first time I saw a movie that was so good that I had to see it again to answer more of my questions. ""The Usual Suspects"" made me jump in the air and scream ""Holy sh*t! What just happened!?!"" ""Inception"" doesn't give you a ""What just happened?"" moment, but it gives you a HS feeling as you leave knowing that there's a director that will treat us like adults.There are so many themes that all of us can relate to: family dynamics, marriage and what the vows really mean, genesis of ideas, the definition of evil (stealing subconscious thoughts/ideas as a job, just as a hit-man kills people, for a living)i.e. what is one's definition of evil, corporate greed and competition. I could go on but people that see the movie will get their own meaning or meanings from it. I've read many reviews comparing this to ""The Matrix."" Sorry haters! They are two different films functioning on two different levels. Dying in ""The Matrix"" meant real death; dying in ""Inception"" just woke one up or depending on the level of the dreaming, trapped one in limbo. Life and death and where reality fits as opposed to reality and how the subconscious gets in the way.As I have gotten older and consumed more media (movies, books, music), I've learned that the best thing I can say about one of these consumables is that there are no throwaway scenes. ""Inception"" is the 500 (1000?) piece puzzle that needs every piece to be complete. If you want everything explained to you, see something else. But if you want to be encouraged to think, go see this movie. Then see it again and again and again. You won't regret it..."
119045,True,"A few years back when I saw The Dark Knight, I thought now thats what made me fall in love with Hollywood. However, Inception made me remember what sheer brilliance this movie industry can create and puts it worlds apart from our Bollywood. SHOCK and AWE !!!! That sums up my experience. As many have already said this is Nolan's masterpiece. The CGI just took it to the next level. I don't favour the recent 3D trend and I thank the producers for not doing something like that to this movie, but considering the story and cinematography I wouldn't have minded, if they had. The acting is not the strongest part of this movie, most of the characters have very little to showcase in this movie. Yet, Joseph Gordon Lewitt,Ken Watanabe, Marion Cotillard did justice to their roles. Leonardo DiCaprio's character was the only thing that had some weight and he performed Brilliantly. (I wish he gets an Oscar nod at least). Brilliance is the only word that can define his performances these days. Nolan has become the go to guy for many new projects for Warner Bros. these days and this is just proof of why it is so. The way this movie has been presented, I cannot give it another name rather than A MASTERPIECE. It shakes you, makes you think and amazes you with the effects, the performances and the story. Nolan deserves every credit that he gets for making such a beautiful and mind boggling movie.The reason I compare it to Matrix is because it makes you think and imagine beyond your normal horizon. It actually requires you to sit and take in everything that is given so that you can enjoy it to the fullest. The reason why I love it even more is because these days with movies like Twilight and all in which you don't have to use your head, this one actually titillates your mind and senses. Now usually when I see such a movie I'd suggest everyone of my friends to check it out. But I caution you to only go watch this movie if you plan to take your Brain with you. It ain't that, keep your head out of the theatre, movie. So if you end up disliking it, Its purely due to lack of concentration.It's simple you would either call it ridiculously Awesome or just plain ridiculous, it all depends on you. The Special effects are outrageous, Leonardo Dicaprio is as usual Unbelievable, the Action sequence is Thrilling, Nolan has gone Over the Top. Yet, what everyone should look-out for is, the story. Note: I haven't seen Paprika and many have complained about it not being credited. I cant say if that is right or wrong, however I personally believe that no anime has yet found a better big screen extravaganza. All I can ask, is for Nolan to watch Death Note. We'd all love that. wouldn't we? The Best Part: The Climax of the movie was the best, I have seen in ages. The audience is devastated, amazed, given hope, rejoiced, then practically left jaw dropped and hung; asking just one question: WAS THAT A DREAM?"
119046,True,"For an original screenplay it conjures up dreams of other movies. It starts with Ken Watananbe looking like Dustin Hoffman in ""Little Big Man"". It contains the assault on Blofeld's headquarters from ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"". Edith Piaf sings to remind us of Marion Cotillard's Oscar win for ""La Vie en Rose"", before Cotillard turns into Norman Bates' ""Psycho"" mother.Ellen Page seemed too young and mumbled her lines. Michael Caine was a distraction in a tea bag role, dipping in here and there. Hans Zimmer wrote a head pounding score that no one could sleep through. Given a ten hour flight to plant the idea in the subjects mind, it seemed like it took ten hours. The burning question of Leo getting home pales to ""are we ever getting out of the theater"". The movie suffers from the written, produced and directed by syndrome. It is way too long, way to loud and way too bad."
119047,True,"I keep hoping I will wake up having seen one of the top three movies of all time, and was only dreaming of being duped once more by the payola-ridden viral-fest that the rating of entertainment on the net has become.""The Matrix"" is an example of an intelligent comic book treatment on film.""Mulholland Drive"" is an example of an intelligent film about dreams.""Inception"" is neither, but currently rated miles above both by the IMDb shills. Go figure.Besides its conceptual shortcomings,""Inception"" is just not a very good movie from a technical perspective. Overlong and overacted by the entire cast in an effort to bring some life to this ""snooze,"" even high dollar action scenes and CGI can't liven it up. No comic relief, none whatsoever, to allay the squirming in the theater seat wondering when it will ever be over.The ""love interest"" subplot is head-scratchingly extraneous to what might have been an interesting corporate espionage thriller.Leonardo D. can not carry a movie any more to save his life, in fact the entire cast is miscast. If you disagree, dream that Tim Roth or Gary Oldman was cast in the lead and tell me I'm wrong."
119048,True,"Christopher Nolan in the past has established himself as one of the best directors working the circuit, equally able to balance the delicacy of smaller pictures and the sheer constructive size of summer blockbusters, making them equally engrossing as a viewing experience.However, as even the best directors do, you have slam into a brick wall somewhere along the career path. Inception is Christopher Nolan's first brick wall, really.In one of those weird complexes of stage and screen, Inception has far fewer flaws as a film than most summer blockbusters, yet is not anywhere near as engrossing as its compatriots trying to dominate the summer ticket aisles every year. The Dark Knight, Nolan's previous outing, was a very flawed film but had me and all of my fellow viewers staggering out of the cinema from the, well...awesomeness of it all.However when I walked out of Inception, the exit doors acted as two erasers, wiping what had happened in the film and refocusing my attention on how I was going to spend the rest of my Friday night.Here are my biggest problems with the film. Firstly the plot. The idea here is a very good one, and the first thirty minutes are the best in the film because it is time spent exploring the dream infiltration, its various levels and the implications of flogging off ideas to the highest bidder etc. etc. But then Nolan makes his biggest mistake of the film, using this high concept into the basis of a soap opera - albeit a soap opera with best visuals ever. This suspended my interested because with all his golden properties one thing Nolan is not good at is emotional storytelling. And so this means the film becomes a battle with trying to keep the plot intensity up and somehow squeezing some emotion out of the beast. In the end the emotional transfer on to the audience gets lost and the 'mega-cool' plot becomes horribly clichéd.The dialogue isn't great either, and the only people who can drag something out of it are Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy, and only because they are mega-cool. MC DiCaprio and the rest of the cast are not, because they rely on emotional impact for their performances, as above mentioned something this film does not have.Speaking of casting, it is on the majority fine. However Ellen Page is not treated with respect by the script and as a result I became annoyed by her rather than inspired by her. DiCaprio is once a again the workhorse, as he usually is in these films, but really does not suit ensemble casts. My biggest difficulty with casting is not who is cast but who Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and to a lesser extent Tom Hardy, are cast as. If I was doing this film I would have had the script rewritten and JGL cast as Cobb and TH cast as Arthur. I have absolutely no Problems with DiCaprio, but I can't shake the feeling that he just doesn't fit in this film, and JGL and TH are class acts.So in the end a film with enormous potential doesn't quite make it is hailed the next big thing because of an excellent marketing campaign but is really quite mediocre."
119049,True,"Whilst Christopher Nolan's Inception is superior in almost all respects to his previous film, The Dark Knight, it's still a portentous, pretentious concept in search of a story. Whilst that concept is a clever one, the film is (as are all Nolan features) seriously over-plotted and far too long, with one-dimensional cardboard characters slotted into position to help prove the director's point about the malleability of reality.It's impossible to give a damn about any of the people involved, and the 'corporate espionage' angle generates little more than a shrug of disinterest. Who cares whether or not some fictional corporation gets broken up or not? Leonardo diCaprio does his best to bring some emotional weight to the table, but Nolan's screenplay doesn't have much room for genuine feeling. There are good performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy, but Ellen Page is atrocious (how long can the woman-in-the-body of a thirteen-year old girl schtick work?), whilst Marion Cottilard is little better. And whoever came up with the idea of using Edith Piaf's Non je ne Regrette Rien as a triggering device should have been fired. Of course, it was probably Mr. Nolan himself.Inception is not a complete waste of time, and it's nice to see a summer blockbuster rely less on explosions and more on matters of the heart and mind, but it's far from a must-see."
119050,True,"MANY SPOILERS FOLLOW!!!One of the main problems with this movie is that it explicates certain directives important to planting ideas and then the movie doesn't follow them. In one scene, Gordon-Levitt is shooting at some bad guys, then Hardy comes over and says, ""Dream bigger,"" and pulls out a grenade launcher. This, coupled with Page's manipulation of the dream early on, seems to indicate that there is power to change what is in the dream. Yet when the van is under attack, the driver only has a crappy pistol. Seriously? What about the directive that an idea has to be simple enough to seem that it springs from the subject's own mind, otherwise they will know its true genesis lies outside them. But the filmmakers steal from many films and don't think the audience will recognize their genesis. People have already mentioned Paprika, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and the Matrix. But there is also in the Cobb/Moll storyline a lot taken from What Dreams May Come. Plus there are Escher stairs that turn into Harry Potter stairs. Personally, even with the hours (felt like) of explication the film did, I never understood how they actually shared dreams. They get wired into a dream? I thought the tube was for what the chemist mixed. How does that allow the dream to be shared? And limbo? Seriously? What a cop out. You remove something that made sense (you die, you wake up) and turn it into ridiculousness--now you're shoved down into pure subconscious and you can't really survive there b/c your brains become scrambled. Yikes. There was plenty more that was problematic, but others here have covered or, I'm sure, will cover that, too. This movie would have been better if it hadn't tried to do so much. Again the trailers were misleading and I thought the plot was going to focus on the ins/outs of many dreams/dreamers. More than a waste of money, it was a waste of time."
119051,True,"WARNING: I GIVE AWAY THE ENDING SO IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.Saw Inception last night and have to say that this is not the classic that many are making it out to be. First let me say that there is nothing at all wrong with the film making. It is well acted, directed and written. The set pieces are flawless and the chain of events that unfold are interesting to watch and not at all that difficult to follow if you pay attention. It is visually stunning at times as well as engaging on a visceral level. I say see it but don't go in with high expectations and enjoy it for what it is, a summer action movie. I won't get into too many details of the movie as that would take up too much space. My issue with the film are as follows:1. For a movie that is about dreams and the sub-conscience this movie is too logical, too linear and makes too much sense for its own good. 2. Inception positions itself as a serious movie and yet the only question at the end of the movie is about the movie itself, what state of reality is Dicaprio living in? (I was already questioning that very early in the film, seemed obvious) The ending is very M. Night Shamalyan and a cop out. A lot of what is on the screen goes back to Plato, Frued, Jung etc. and there are many movies that have handled similar topics with more creativity and depth. (See 8 1/2, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Schynecdoche NY and even The Matrix left me with more to think about) 3. A movie like this should leave one asking big questions and lead to big discussions. A thoughtful Hmmmmmm followed by weeks, maybe months of thought, should follow the cut to black. Instead many in the theater let out an audible gasp. I overheard people asking is Dicaprio in reality or is he still in a dream? The fact that the question posed is about the movie itself is quite frankly boring, pedestrian and far too common of movies now a days. The audience reaction was not their fault though as this is pretty much all there was to ask. I can't answer why Direcor/writer Nolan did not deal directly with bigger thoughts/themes when they are alluded to throughout. A nod in the direction of depth is not the same thing though and in the end my yawn was drowned out by the gasps. And my sense is that the gasps led to nothing more than the exits."
119052,True,You quickly get where the story is going with the dream in a dream idea. The storyline becomes more complex as the movie progress forward. Sadly the same cannot be said for the development of characters. The main character is the only one that is treated and the only thing we see about him is that he miss his wife and kids. This is not enough to empathize with his character.A young girl as the role of the protagonist but it's hard to identify with her character as she is annoying. The story is not engaging as we don't really care for those characters. Masturbatory special effect don't save this empty shell. All the levels of dreams were rather annoying and felt like a way to masquerade the absence interesting plot.Disappointing. Such a movie shouldn't get such a high rating on IMDb.
119053,True,"My wife and I fell for all the hype and went to this monstrosity of a film. I tried very hard to ""get it,"" but my wife just fell asleep. I appreciate the objective of venturing into the wonders of Dreamland, but I've gone nighty-night every night for nearly 63 years without ANYTHING remotely resembling any level of any of the dreams portrayed. My first problem with the film was the basic technical premise of one person being able to get inside another person's dreams. OK, I was willing to accept the concept on faith, but here you have a bunch of supposedly brilliant characters explaining it to each other, and their explanations lurched between ""sophomoric"" and ""incoherent."" Then, accepting the dubious premises of the story, you have this idea that the dream compresses time as compared to reality, so the dream within the dream compresses time even further, and so forth. OK, I'll buy that, but the EFFECT of this is that when we're two HOURS into the movie, suddenly everything is going VERY slowly. We watch that van falling imperceptibly toward the water, and although there's a lot of hyperkinetic action going on at the other levels, my wife is sound asleep and I'm asking myself whether it will take all night for that damn van to hit the water so we can all go home. And while all this is going on, who within the story do we really care about? The dead wife? The cute chick who was supposed to be so smart, but just kind of sits there and doesn't do much as the plot unfolds? The rich guy whose brains are being used as an Interstate Freeway and shooting gallery for some other rich guy's advantage? Leonardo? Forget it. He's like Captain Ahab chasing the whale, but at least Ahab had the good grace to go down to his death with the whale. The only ones I could empathize with were the two little kids, and they've turned their back on their father. I don't blame them."
119054,True,"yes... something's definitely not right. IMDb must have been taken over by a horde of Nolan's fans, or maybe is this all just a bad dream, it just can't be true, no... Please someone send me a kick in order me to wake up because this movie can't possibly be ranking 3rd in IMDb Top 250...I mean, come on ! there's nothing more to this movie than to any other action scenes centered summer blockbusters.People who describe its narrative structure as complicated must have a hell of time using a lift in a building, because, really... it just gets as complicated as that...And switching at a high rate between the layers doesn't add any depth, just get the whole ensemble a little confusing for short attention span people at best...The plot is completely shallow, we don't even care one second about the characters, it's just all about action. Is Nolan able to dream only about gunshot and some buildings scrambling into the sea... well that's quite sad...What's the most resilient parasite ? A idea, no... a heavy marketed movie, unfortunately, yes..."
119055,True,"Based on most reviews so far, it would appear that we indeed have an instant classic here, but it is not so. Here are a few reasons, which others probably are forgetting in the after-glow of seeing a more rare film...or simply this is a good indication that good films are dying out and anything a bit out of the ordinary is a ""gem"". Comparisons to Matrix are ludicrous, btw. Anyhow, a few of those points (and most of them can be related to some sloppy writing, I believe): - The plot is simpler than what it seems, and is helped along the way with introduction of simplistic rules such as, a 5 minute in reality is 1 hour in dream state 'on the first level' etc. (come on!) - The only driving motive of the main protagonist is none other but 'to return to my kids' (oh, how original...) - In these writers' world, the guys who perform the dirty deeds of the utmost sophistication (breaking in people's subconscious!) for the likewise dirty corporations, have the cutest kids on the block, and we are somehow to root for this guy in his struggle to get back to those kids. - In the same fashion, the whole plot rests on about a two sentence dialogue, whereby one corporate magnate persuades the main protagonist to get on with the inception mission, because their competitor would otherwise become very powerful. - There's a serious over-indulgence in action scenes (which, true, are executed very well). But the whole film clocking at 147 minutes is mostly due to these stretched action scenes, which don't bring much new. - The whole story becomes convoluted to the point of messy, where the story first evolves around the inception, then becomes survival, then becomes resolution of the main protagonist subconscious conflicts. With a lot of bang-bang on top of everything else. - There are some good 'mind-bending' scenes, the shame is they are all shown in the movie trailer. (when will they stop this practice???) - Ariadne, aka the Architect, proves her role on the team through her skills, which are later on not utilized very much. Overall, this character is badly structured, with added fact that her big mythological name is all there is to the mythology side of things. Her only purpose that seems to remain was to move the story at a key moment, when the whole team is ready to 'terminate the mission', which was not all that convincing. - The sub-plot around the main protagonists and his wife is fairly interesting, but the resolution in him leaving her felt like some kind of escape writing (now how do we end this so we can move the story on?) - I am usually very keen to forgive such minute detail as the number of shots fired and missed, but in here, it was bordering on ridiculous.All in all, this is an action movie, with sci-fi elements, as opposed to being a sci-fi movie with action movie elements. I believe it is mostly catering to a crowd of late teenagers, and thus doesn't become very elaborate in terms of background philosophy, psychology etc. but rather becomes very action movie oriented. I perceived it as a good fun for the moment, but nothing terribly memorable. It felt like a good idea, going in, but the film doesn't deliver on a more subtle, but deeper layer, where for example a much more memorable movies like Matrix delivered so well. I would advise a more serious movie fan, after inevitable seeing this movie, to look elsewhere for similar concepts and compare: - Being John Malkovich; for excellent depiction of 'collapsing into one's subconsciuos' and the whole story of messing with someone's mind Waking Life; for excellent depiction of what it truly means to no longer distinguish which is reality and which is dream Memento; for excellent depiction of messing up one's memory and where it might lead"
119056,True,"I went into the multiplex to watch this movie without much expectation. I had seen all the trailers, but they did not really give away much of what I was going to see, in my opinion. When the credits started rolling, I was amazed. This is the best movie I've seen in the past 2 years. The last time I had so much to say about a movie was when I saw Nolan's ""Dark Knight"" First of all the opening is top-notch. It builds up the suspense, and smoothly moves on to introducing DiCaprio's character to the audience. DiCaprio shows us the first ""mind heist"" of the movie. His character Cobb feels the need to go home, and stealing others' ideas so that he can buy his way back to the US. It is revealed that he committed a crime in France, so he has not had the misfortune of being extradited.Cobb gets a job from Saito (Watanabe) to get into Fisher's (Cilian Murphy) mind and steal an idea. To do so, Cobb needs to build the dream world, for which he hires an architect Ariadne (Ellen Page). Cobb has secrets of his own, which are revealed in the lower levels of his mind, so to speak. He searches for a sedative that can enable him to create a dream within a dream within a dream. To keep track of reality, he keeps a top. If the top topples, he is in the real world.Cobb is supported by an excellent supporting cast. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy are excellent accomplices in his mind crimes. Michael Caine too gets some screen time. Mal (Marion Cotillard) is an impressive Shade, the memory which keeps killing all other 'projections', which is the dream representation of the real-world character. Cobb is constantly seeking ways to assuage his guilt of being partially responsible for Mal's death. It was because of him that she lost the ability to distinguish between dreams and reality, constantly seeking 'the kick' - the feeling of falling that jolts one out of her dream.After the heist is over, Cobb is seen going back to the US, clearing immigration without being arrested. He spins the top on the table, which never really topples by the time the credits roll. Perhaps reality was never good enough for Cobb, and he has chosen to live in a dream forever until his brain is reduced to mush. Perhaps he did go home. The viewer is left wondering, bringing this brilliant movie to an end."
119057,True,"If you liked Nolan's previous films ""Memento"" and/or ""The Prestige"", you will love Inception. Like those films it does a good job of setting the ground rules for the world so you are never confused but at the same time reality can be distorted but it never does at the expense of the story. Deep down this film is about forgiveness and letting go but also has a great sci-fi sheen that never takes that idea away. Even if the story doesn't hook you than you will be in awe of the set pieces that put many other films to shame where you never can predict what will come next. Overall this is a great film that will stand out this summer of lackluster films by being smart, action packed, and containing real emotion and heart. I can't recommend it enough."
119058,True,"I didn't like it, Nolan has done much much better work.Memento is in another league creatively, TDK a much better action blockbuster, The Prestige a subtle masterpiece.Here's the problems with the movie:1. Ellen Page was miscast, she's too young. Either make her 5 years younger or 5 years older. If older she'd be a love interest, if younger she'd be an amazing prodigy.2. Her prowess and quick acceptance were unbelievable. There needed to be a scene where she proved herself to LeoDC at the school, some amazing ability.3. The script was overly simplistic because they needed to explain the intricate plot. Example: the snow level when they go over the timing of the levels again to remind the audience things happen at different perceived times the deeper down you go. As if the constant shots of the slowly falling van weren't enough. Let's not even discuss the ridiculousness that there is a direct correlation of time between levels. I get that the deeper you go the more time becomes blurred, but a direct numerical correlation?4. Joseph G-L was given no room to show how great an actor he is; his character was stiff and wooden, strange for the ""organizer"".5. LeoDC walked straight off the set of Shutter Island into this movie without changing character. Not his fault, the characters are similar, maybe they should have cast someone else.6. The action sequences, apart from the hotel hallway fight scene, were unoriginal and obligatory, nowhere near TDK. The snow scenes in particular were straight out of an early Bond movie. It would have been better to have left them out completely and spent more time making the movie more complexly layered, with better character development.7. The idea has been done before, and better. The comparison with The Matrix is inevitable, and Inception comes up so lacking.8. The targeting of Cillian Murphy's character was very very mean-spirited, especially since we learn that inception can permanently ruin one's mind and lead to suicide. It's not for revenge, not for patriotism, not for the betterment of mankind, but for corporate greed. It's hard to get behind the characters when they are doing such an ugly thing: targeting a young man who already has major father/son issues because of his successful father, and making those issues much worse. This isn't Ocean's 11 where we don't mind Andy Garcia getting the shaft because we want to see George Clooney get Tess, and Garcia is a jerk anyway. The premise of inception was interesting, but the execution on a complete innocent was downright ugly.Inception was a lot of movies I'd already seen, let's call it Ocean's 11 meets The Matrix, but had none of the light-hearted humor of O11, where I felt the crime was justified, or at least other ""gang heist"" movies so clever and the victim so nameless it didn't really matter.In the end, I feel Inception is going to go down as one of Nolan's worst movies, a clever idea that was made with too high a budget and expectations, such that meaningless action was thrown in, and the film didn't know whether it was a psychological mindbender or an action movie, and wasn't able to pull off both in the manner of the ever-brilliant Matrix."
119059,True,"---CONTAINS SPOILER---- I'll be honest. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, but it does not deserve to rank #3 on IMDb alongside masterpieces as the godfather... It's really insulting! The movie is average and unnecessarily long, as well as terribly repetitive: bum bum bang bang in Mombasa; car chases and bum bum bang bang in the rain; bum bum bang bang in a hotel, and yes of course, bum bum bang bang in the snow...!!! I could really yawn at the second bum bum bang bang...!!! It was as if the only reason Nolan created so many layers of dreams within dreams was to justify different Rambo scenarios...Therefore, any depth the movie can achieve gets lost within the dumb shootings, endless chases and meaningless explosions...And the ending is so predictable...!!! I personally prefer other Nolan films, like The Dark Knight."
119060,True,"If you didn't like The Matrix movies, here's more of the same. Movies involving dreams and alternate realities basically set up a world where anything can happen and there are no rules.I LIKE rules. If there were rules here, they were very hard to follow and very shortly into the movie, I just didn't care.Leo's character claims to be the greatest person in the world at delving into people's minds. Then why is he so consistently incompetent at it? His dead wife keeps popping up when she's least welcome, nothing ever goes to plan. The whole plan benefits only Leo, puts everyone else in jeopardy and is built on very shaky ground. Saito says he will fix Leo's problems with one phone call and he's immediately on board? Speaking of the plan, why does implanting a fairly simple idea into another person's head involve blowing everything up in sight? I didn't care about his dead wife. Was she actually dead or did she just die in a dream and is stuck in limbo? I wish *I* was stuck in limbo so I didn't have to think about this movie anymore.Some notes about the actors: I could rarely understand what Ken Watanabe was saying. Ellen Page still looks like she's ten years old and I just didn't accept her in this role. The other guys were okay but I just wasn't invested into anything they were saying or doing.As it has been noted in other reviews, what do I care if this guy Fischer's company is bigger than Saito's or not? ""Let's go through all of this convoluted nonsense because in the future, something bad MIGHT happen?"" There's one method of getting him to break up his company that could have been tried and wasn't: Walk up to him and ask him to break up his company. He didn't seem all that ambitious, he didn't seem to care about his father's company. It would have been worth a shot.Part of me kept hoping the plane would crash and it would end the necessity of all this.It's too bad that in a reality where anything can happen, Nolan creates a world where nothing of consequence happens."
119061,True,"I must admit, we went to see this in the theater after the massive positive reviews, the high ratings on IMDb, and most of all, the promising concept of the film...Di Caprio is one of the finest actors. He's got charisma and knows what he's doing and how he's bringing it, but as a 'hero' he doesn't seem to pull it off. I just don't believe him... He's too, I don't know quite how to put it... too soft? His performance was impeccable though, but I think the director wasn't assertive enough to direct him as he should have.But then again, it's not due to Di Caprio the whole thing was full of flaws. The main thing that annoyed me most was (again) the overdue of explosions and cgi. Although high quality and nice use of it didn't add any value to the whole thing. On the contrary!!!Second, there was the inconsistency of things happening. (And not only this one, but let's leave at this) Everything was surrounded by the truck falling into the water and there is what insulted me so much. At the speed the truck was falling it should have hit the water more than five times when things were happening. Every time the scenes were cutting back to the truck they made sure he was going back up instead of going down. Friends of mine said, 'yeah, it was, but don't make such a big fuss out of it'! Well, in fact I do, because that is what was driving the sequences. What did the director think? That we have no brains? Maybe some haven't looking at the comments and ratings, but one couldn't look next to the fact that things were so bluntly thrown at us. OK, you can say 'it's all a dream isn't it?, but still...And what was it near the end when Di Caprio suddenly wakes up without any explanation. Quite laughable actually because there was more then enough explaining throughout the whole movie. Now this is happening, now that. I mean, come on...Next time they should take out all the Hollywood sh ite and put some intelligent stuff in. You know, some things that makes our mind buzz.I only saw one movie once that had what it takes but was left out of the picture due to another one, the matrix. The movie I'm talking about was '13th Floor'!So, if you have the time and want a good reference to make sure what is wrong with Inception, then watch '13th Floor'!!!Since everyone is highly overrating this movie, I'm going to 'underrate' it with at least one point. It gets a 4/10, and believe me, many will say that it is still too much!So once again, rent '13th Floor' if you want something that'll make you go 'wohow'"
119062,True,"I know Nolan is a director, not a scientist.However, as a person who relies on logic and reason to understand the world, I need at least some plausibility with my science fiction films in order to immerse myself into the experience.I've had lucid dreams before, at least I think I have. I remember that I've done things in dreams to try to discern if I am indeed dreaming, but I don't necessarily remember how I existed as a conscious entity in those dreams. I might have sort of been just a third person omniscent, invisible ""thing"" floating around observing myself walking around. I think I may have fluctuated between first person and third person consciousness, where I would somehow start distorting everything around ""me"" once the idea occurred that I may not be in reality. Then, when everything becomes a huge, entropic mess, I would wake up. Of course this experience may be unique to me, but it seems that the fluid nature of dreams lends itself to something much more complex than a simple duplication of reality from a person's awake state. Nolan completely ignored this aspect, and I feel it detracted from the overall strength of the film.Furthermore, I don't even remember why I tried to figure out I was in a dream, and I also don't remember recalling the need to question if things make sense from a Newtonian physics standpoint. Newtonian physics is undoubtedly ""intuitive"", but because consciousness itself is such an opaque field, I don't see why something such as a spinning top would convince any reasonable person that they are dreaming or in ""reality"". How could Cobb be certain the top was accurately representing reality or a dream anyway, since it is nothing but his projection of what he thinks will happen in his dream. That is, how could the top transcend the laws of the new world created by the architect, and behave strictly by Cobb's current, conscious interpretation? Also, the transplantation of consciousness from an awake state to a dream state is also independent of a transplantation of memories. It seems to me that Nolan practically invoked the transmission of ""souls"" into the movie, and may have in the process confused the concepts of souls and consciousness.It seems like these characters completely neglected what it means to actually dream and what it means to live in a dream-like world. Sure, perhaps this is not relevant to the movie itself, but in addition to other disappointments such as static characters and shallow dialogue, I can say that it kind of turned me off to the film's main grab: its philosophical implications (which, granted, may not be too deep anyway, considering the crux of the whole film just seems to be that there is no way to distinguish what is ""real"" and what isn't. Essentially, the age-old the whole perception vs. reality argument).Overall, better than anything this year, but it falls short."
119063,True,"Watching this movie was a complete waste of time. Afther watching, you realize that screenplay has (too)many faults, that directing is on high school level, and that actors are pathetic, just like director. I really don't see the reason why this movie did get such good reviews. Nolan took parts from movies like; The Cell, The Matrix, Oceans Eleven, James Bond, and the final product is a bunch of nonsense. I personally don't like Nolan's films, but with this one he's gone really too far. He got lost when he was filming, you can tell it from the beginning of the movie. It's a type of film for American audience. I hope it will fail in Europe."
119064,True,"Like many people anxious to watch Inception, I spent many hours online reading news, watching trailers, and just sharing my enthusiasm about it. Then I began reading weird rumours about the film involving time travelling (it doesn't) and other potential spoilers, and I decided it was time to get away from the hubbub and wait for it in isolation. I wanted to watch the film as purely as possible. I only allowed myself one treat; I didn't resist listening to my beloved Hans Zimmer's score in advance. I never imagined my feelings about the music would reflect my feelings about the film. I expected an exquisite delicacy and instead got a steak with fries. And afterwards I was still hungry.By now word of mouth has taken all the secrecy away from the story, so let's be brief about it. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, the leader of a criminal crew that infiltrates the minds of people during their sleep to steal their ideas and sell them. After a botched assignment, Cobb and his partner, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Leavitt), are hired by Saito (Ken Watanabe) to do the reverse: instead of stealing an idea, they must implant an idea in a victim's subconscious, implant it so deeply that he won't doubt it came from himself. The victim is Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), the heir of an energetic mega-conglomerate that threatens to have monopoly over half the world's energy supply. The idea is to convince him to dismantle this empire. For this epic assignment Cobb hires the architect Ariadne (Ellen Page), the forger Eames (Tom Hardy) and the chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao).Inception has the best ensemble cast I've seen so far this year. That doesn't mean it has the best acting  I think that honour still goes to Shutter Island, which had heartbreaking performances by Ben Kingsley and DiCaprio himself. But the viewer can be sure that a film that contains all the talent mentioned above plus Marion Cottilard plus cameos by Michael Caine, Lukas Haas, Tom Berenger and Pete Postlethwaite, is at least captivating on account of all the charisma walking in and out of the screen every two seconds.I think the film needs all this charisma to satisfy because it doesn't offer much else in terms of entertainment. One of the greatest crimes a film that takes place in dreams within dreams within dream within dreams (yes, you counted it right), can be accused of is being visually dull. Anyone who saw the trailer has nothing else to look forward to, it's all there: the zero gravity hallway fight scene, the city folding, the snow power station attack, the collapsing urban landscapes. The film only expands on the trailer, it has no other impressive scene. Any artist worth his salt only uses dreams as a theme if he wants to show something visually interesting. Dreams aren't held by physical laws; they're limitless, strange, threatening. In Christopher Nolan's world, however, I can see stranger dreams if I just look outside my window.Christopher Nolan is not a particularly inventive filmmaker. There's no visual exuberance in his films. I noticed this when he turned Gotham City, a wonderfully Gothic and oppressive landscape in the Batman comic books, into a replica of any American city. Midas' touch turns things into gold. But Nolan's touch turns uniqueness into banality. Not even dreams are safe from him. Defenders will rise to say that the realism of the dreams is the point. But then why dreams? Who makes a film about Mozart to ignore his music? Many will also say that Inception is a strange film. That's arguable, of course. It's ambiguous enough to allow several interpretations. But it makes sense most of the time. Good writing and good editing contribute to that. I think this is also what made Nolan's previous attempt at a mind-boggling film, The Prestige, so satisfying. He's a fair director. He takes time to show everything the viewer needs to know to understand what's going on, and the film's rhythm is slow. Inception is strange in the sense that other mainstream, but quirkier than average, films are called strange, like The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It's strange in a very limited way, custom-made for audiences that have been deprived of strangeness for so long that they can't recognise it anymore; it's a strangeness that hardly brings dignity to the true strangeness unleashed by Wojciech Has' The Hourglass Sanatorium or Jan Svankmajer's Faust.This banality applies even to the action. There are directors who've revolutionised the way action is filmed: John Woo, the Wachowski brothers, even Michael Bay. But Inception, with the exception of the inventive hallway fight scene, leaves much to be desired. Car chases and gun fights play out much the way we expect, with little elegance or imagination.Inception's saving grace is that, for an action thriller, the main character is far more complex and engaging than usual. Cobb is a man tormented by past horrors, separated from his children, running away for a crime he didn't commit. When he enters dreams his subconscious takes the form of his dead wife, Mal (Cottilard), always ready to foil his plans. Cobb isn't just a cool thief but a man trying to get his life back and DiCaprio makes him effortlessly sympathetic.I don't know why, but I feel bad for not liking Inception more. Cinema certainly needs ambitious films that mix intellect with action; that dare to be unique while being familiar. Inception is a respectable failure, in my view, but is a step in the right direction. I hope at least it inspires other filmmakers to move in the same direction."
119065,True,"Every now and then a movie comes along that is so far superior to the average film it takes your breath away and reminds you why you love movies. Inception does that and more.Not since The Matrix (1999) has a movie exploded onto the scene like Inception leaving an awed audience in absolute chills having witnessed something so fresh, so unique, so thought-provoking and deep that the experience lasts long after the credits roll. It's more than a movie. It's artistic expression at its finest blending beautiful imagery, powerful music, relentless intensity, riveting plot, mesmerizing ideas and heart wrenching emotions, all while captivating an imagination in a fresh and unique way.There are aspects of this movie that simply have not been attempted before. There are images and visuals that before existed only inside ones imagination or dreams. There are spellbinding manipulations of the space time continuum altering preconceived notions of reality.Without any spoilers I will say that the primary vehicle for the plot encompasses the mysterious world of dreams. Specifically the notion of extracting or implanting information or ideas within ones dream. The way in which this topic is approached is highly intriguing in and of itself. But there is so much more to this movie than just dreams.This is a story about guilt, love, redemption, letting go, contentment, curiosity, creativity, acceptance, desires, choices, consequences, priorities and approval. The role children play in our lives and the enormous responsibility and influence we have in theirs was a particularly meaningful theme of the film for me. There are some very touching scenes that will certainly stay with you long after the movie.However, what's so refreshing is the manner in which this story is told. We are provided with the least amount of information necessary in order to follow along and be emotionally invested. Some might find this creates confusion and unanswered questions. I find it creates a crisp, intelligent and thought-inspiring story without falling prey to the annoying and all too common practice of over-explanation found in most movies today. I don't need or want every little thing explained to me over and over again. This is a movie that demands multiple viewings. Some things are left up to interpretation, but many of the so-called unanswered questions will be answered by watching it a second time. At least that was my experience.I also really like how the movie doesn't try to be noble or grand. No one is trying to save the world or conquer an evil enemy. It's a basic plot, but it's just told on a grand scale in a very entertaining and unique way. The primary motivations of both the protagonist and the person that hires him to do a job that makes up the bulk of the storyline is very simple and relatable. One is trying to overcome an obstacle to get home and the other is trying to advance his own power and influence. But neither is presented as either good or bad. As an audience we don't know if the results that occur if the mission succeeds will have a positive or negative impact on the world. We are simply told what is necessary and important. We can fill in the rest as we see fit. And how each individual viewer chooses to see the movie will largely be influenced by their own personal biases and their ""projections"" used to fill in the blanks. Those that have seen the movie just caught my intentional use of the word ""projections"" and can probably guess where I'm heading next.This leads me to the true brilliance of the movie. Inception isn't just occurring in the movie, it's occurring to the audience. We become part of the subject matter. Those that have seen the end of the movie know what I'm referring to. I won't go into any detail, but I will say this. A single idea in the human mind is a very powerful thing. Keep that in mind, not while watching the movie, but afterwards while analyzing it. You might be surprised what you discover.I'll end by saying that Christopher Nolan is fast becoming the greatest director of his generation. Dark Knight is the pinnacle of the superhero genre. I thought that would be Nolan's masterpiece. I was wrong. Inception is his greatest masterpiece to date. Nolan has skyrocketed into my Top 10 all-time favorite directors.And Leonardo DiCaprio is fast becoming one of the most accomplished actors of any generation. At age 35 he has already squeezed in a lifetime worth of quality films working with the top directors in the industry. And I think he hasn't even hit his peak yet. In another 35 years don't be surprised if he's widely considered to be on the short list of greatest actors ever. Not bad for the little trouble-maker punk kid on Growing Pains.And I certainly can't forget the amazing musical score by composer Hans Zimmer. The music in this movie is absolutely one of the characters. It's engrossing and completely elevates the entire experience. It's beautiful. Right now I can't think of a better movie score. And I'm a movie score connoisseur. Like the movie itself, you will not be able to get the music out of your head.Finally, allow me to take this opportunity to announce that there is a new #1 on the very top of my all-time favorite movies. I never thought Braveheart could be eclipsed. But I never imagined a movie like Inception. Since I've seen the movie multiple times I don't feel this is simply a reactionary decision. I've put a lot of thought into it. Anyone that knows me knows that I take my ""favories"" of anything very seriously.Do yourself a favor and go see my all-time favorite movie INCEPTION."
119066,True,"""Dreams feel real while we are in them. Its only when we wake up that we realize something was strange..."" I think I am in love with this movie. This is a very captivating movie which is slickly edited and directed. I don't want to hype this movie too much, but this movie is truly the best film in this year by far, and one of the best of this decade. Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite directors and Leonardo Di Caprio is also one of my favourite actors. I cannot believe that this incredible actor gets snubbed at the Oscars year after year even after doing so many amazing movies. Anyway, the idea for the creation of this movie is not exactly new. I have seen some movies which take place inside the subconscious mind, but Inception pushes the boundary to a whole new level. There are three levels; a dream, within a dream, within a dream which is a whole new concept and it was exciting. For every 5 minutes in the real world, it is an hour in the first level dream state, a week in the second level and some decades in the third level. The film scores some brownie points for the concept itself. My friends and me were captivated by the world of dreams. The great background score along with the taut screenplay was spectacular.Cobb (Leonardo Di Caprio) is the best at what he does and the US government is wary of his skills for which it has made him an international fugitive. Cobb isn't your normal skilled thief, he is the best in the dangerous art of extraction, that is he delves deep into your subconscious mind while you are asleep and steals valuable secrets. This rare superior ability of Cobb has made him a coveted player in the immoral world of corporate espionage. During one of his normal extraction jobs, he cannot uncover the secret that a corporate leader, Saito (Ken Watanabe) is hiding. Saito offers him his life back in USA with his children if he does one last job for him; Inception. Planting an idea in the human mind is a far more dangerous job than extraction, but Cobb accepts and assembles a group of talented players to pull off this mission. Ariadne (Ellen Page) is the new comer and her job is to design the world in the dream, as the previous guy isn't exactly available and Cobb himself has took himself out from designing. Mal Cobb (Marion Cotillard) keeps ruining Cobb's perfect dream plans and there seems to be a dark secret which nobody know. Cobb could potentially destroy their lives if he cannot control his memories and dreams.When Christoher Nolan announced that he would put Batman on the backburner and make this movie with Di Caprio, I was really disappointed because although I am a fan of Di Caprio, I loved the new Batman franchise under the direction of Nolan. It was darker, more intense and definitely more exciting, and I wanted the third part to be made soon. If you have seen the trailers for Inception, you know that it doesn't explain much about the plot. But it looked stunning and I went along for Nolan's ride, being a willing participant. I was blown away and most of you will be too if you would be willing to accept the plot. To write a dream is difficult in this era when most of the stories out there are just rehashed versions of the same story. Somebody should try to follow in Nolan's great footsteps, because we need more filmmakers like him who aren't afraid to blast away the boundaries and create their own benchmark. This movie will be remembered and hailed for generations to come.Some movies make you think deeper even after you finish watching it and this is definitely one of them. Tom keeps on dreaming that one day he will be able to return to his home and live with his children in reality. But the boundary between dream and reality is blurring. Marion Cotillard's scenes were gripping and my heartbeat was racing when she was on the window sill. The English guy gave the lighthearted moments in the movie which I liked. The movie takes us through a roller coaster ride, oscillating between dream and reality and sometimes I was left wondering whether the events were taking place in someone's dream or in reality. Christopher Nolan has displayed some excellent film-making techniques and come up with a story that is intelligent as well as exciting. The performances are great across the board and I am truly hoping that Leo Di Caprio gets an Oscar nod this time around (Two back to back amazing movies from him - Shutter Island and Inception, Oscar is way overdue for him). The supporting cast of Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Marion Cotillard, Dileep Rao, Michael Caine were great. Di Caprio headed the group on his able shoulders and doesn't disappoint. Three cheers to the master director, Christopher Nolan.10/10"
119067,True,"I gave Inception a seven out of ten because the first hour of the movie was missing that ""grab you"" factor, and I almost found it a little boring. Everything is kicked into high gear though,when ellen page asks leonardo's character a specific question. It is the turning point of the movie and I was completely enthralled by it come the one hour mark. I know Christopher Nolan had been bouncing around the concept and script of this movie for the better half of ten years, but I still could not keep myself from getting ""deja vu"" in certain scenes of the movie. I was expecting this movie to be hands down, off the wall original, but instead I kept on thinking of Shutter Island, Dark City, the Matrix, and Batman Begins. (All movies I love) All the technical and cinematography aspects of the movie are amazing;definitely a 10. One other small thing that bothered me was when I read a review of the movie. It said something along the lines of "" you will have to see this movie more than once to get it."" So, I was going into the movie fully expecting to have to do that like I did with The Prestige. It was not the case, however. Unless you are really dumb, or not paying full attention to the movie, you will get it the first time. All in all, the movie is awesome but not for those with a short attention span."
119068,True,"Where do I start with Inception? To delve into the plot would actually take away the film's effectiveness but say too little and it begs the purpose of this review at all. So, on that note, there will be certain, but non-major, plot points spoken about. Some very minor spoilers (again, not plot ruining) but if you wish to go in knowing as little as possible (which is the best way, trust me), then it might be worth skipping the review.DiCaprio is a gent called Dom Cobb, the best extractor in the business of subconscious espionage. Extraction is easy, however when Dom is asked to attempt Inception, the tricky practice of planting an idea into their target's mind (it is explained why it's more difficult but I can't explain it here), the stakes are raised much higher: there's the promise of finally getting home to his family, of whom he has been in hiding for an undisclosed but lengthy period of time.One thing to say about Inception, apart from how truly, utterly brilliant it is, is that it is probably the most original film since The Matrix back in 1999. I think one of the key components that will either invigorate audiences or turn them off is the fact that it's not based on an already established name, be it an adaptation or a sequel. That in itself is refreshing enough but the genius conceit of Inception is that it believes so much in the world it's created that it leaves very little catching up time for the audience. The rules for Extraction and Inception are laid down thick and fast and woe betide the fellow that insists on a pee break. Miss even two minutes of this film and you're lost.But in laying down the rules, the second half of the film (in which DiCaprio's team implement the Inception heist) acts them out with aplomb. We have dreams within dreams within dreams and things that happen in one plain of reality directly effect that in the next, for example: whilst the team is unconscious in freefall in one, in the subsequent dream they're all weightless, and whilst a van in which the team is asleep tumbles down a hill, the gravity in the next starts to shift (giving us that awesome corridor fight from the trailer).Christopher Nolan really has taken everything he's learned from making mature adult blockbusters and utilised it here with maximum effect. To say it's thinking man's blockbuster is understating things but, unlike the Michael Bay's of this world, he does not feel the need to treat his audience like kids. Whilst Inception may hold a 12A certificate, that's not to say it's for children of that age, not because of any of its content I must add, just that the plot, which is perfectly written and executed, will just be too much for those that crave robots hitting each other.But, that said, there is a lot here that will appeal to that demographic. The visuals, whether it is during much of the trippy dream imagery or the outstanding action sequences, are spectacular. Whilst grounding much of the dream world in reality, that's not to stop Paris from folding in on itself or have gravity shifting from wall to wall.But, as stated, what makes Inception work is it stubbornness to stick to it's established rules. So ten hours in real time equates to a week in the dream world but a dream within that dream equates to six months and a dream within that dream equates to ten years and so on, so whilst moments that are instantaneous in one dream, the team knows that they'll have around twenty minutes to get things done in the next, etc. Once you get your head around it, you have to marvel at how well the filmmakers have been able to juggle the different time frames within the dream world. It pays off in spade and once everything comes together in the end (of which it does in outstanding fashion) the satisfaction of staying with Nolan and his convoluted but never confusing mind is like nothing I've experienced in the cinema for years.Inception is literally like nothing you've ever seen before. A heist movie with some serious balls, this is, hands down, Christopher Nolan's finest accomplishment. There will be those that wont like it (it has already garnered some vehemently hostile criticism) and I can understand why but I was enthralled by not only the spectacle but also the sheer bravura at its ideas.This is Nolan's masterpiece."
119069,True,"According to macmillan English dictionary inception means '' beginning of something '' , but here the word is used to mean something like the rhyming word conception .Just like conception means planting of seed in womans womb ,here inception is taken to mean planting of an idea in someone's brain .........and the idea is planted by going into his dreams.......by dreaming together.Loenardo goes into other people's dreams and finds out their secrets .......but is hired this time for .........inception.......what else..........to plant into the brain of the heir to an energy conglomerate the idea that he must divide it instead of strengthening it after his father's death ,in order for its rivals to survive........the hirers are the rivals ,but of course.........But does inception work ?Leonardo is near perfect for the job as he knows the answer to this very question .........though only he knows that he knows........because he's tried inception on somebody very near and dear to him.........and it worked.................And for this very reason he's not really perfect ........for trying inception led to disastrous effects .........not only on his life ,but also on his mind..........and now those very effects threaten to upset and unsettle his dreams ..........i mean not only when he is actually dreaming as part of his job of sharing dreams with other people , but also his real life dream of getting back to his land to be with his mother-less children..........confusing ??........well ,so is the movie.........confusing and complex both......but what a movie........and as the plot gets more intricate ,and the characters begin to dream ,and dream in those dreams ,so does the action hot up..........as all the laws of physics ,and those of gravity too .......go for a toss ,we get to see breathtaking special effects that light up the screen........... .........and fast-paced action sequences that make you miss your heart beats.......director nolan has pulled of a triumph that outclasses other special effects movies of the year like avtar and 2012 ,which look so so shallow in front of this incredibly cerebral thriller............the ending ,of course is deliberately vague.........to keep discussions rolling ,and tongues wagging long after you have walked out of the big screen cinema.................yeah ,thats where you need to see it .........on the big screen ,with digital sound and all that........shame on those who want to see it on the small screen.........my bet is that it has some awards...................or i will eat my words........"
119070,True,"If someone tried to Incept my subconscious - boy are they in for a surprise! Who the hell has faceless pistol toting gun-fodder henchmen for mental defenses anyway? You know what those evil corporate bastards out to grab my secrets see when they step into their ""structured dream world"" which my subconscious has populated??Golden Dragons with napalm breath and Nazgul riders. Armored polar bears the size of double decker-ed Hummers. Sorcerers yelling ""avada kedavra"" at anything blonde and male. Jasons and Kruegers (yes, Krueger will be in MY dream and I will control that funky demon, muhahahaha). Wee Leprechauns doing the Moonwalk. And unicorns spewing rainbow goo all over the wannabe Inceptors, while they scream in strangely squeaky voices, arms raised to heaven (which, of course, has turned in upon itself). And oh - millions and millions of gut munching zombies flying between skyscrapers, defying gravity, just for effect. Then Ill play ""Never Gonna Let you Go"", full blast. And LO!, just when Cobb and his dandy tuxedoed men think ""Oh we are SOOO rick rolled, HOT DAMN!"", I would appear, like a semi-drunk, all knowing, starry caped, fop-smiled mage and turn all their guns to beautiful yellow posies, and send them home to sleep (sweet dreams within dreams, babies) with their wives (magically transformed to Kim Kardashian). Cuz underneath, in my deepest of deepest mind, I'm a wonderfully kind and silly man.Christopher Nolan, Sir, This is what a D.R.E.A.M. looks like. Idiot."
119071,True,"I will start off by saying that this movie does deserve attention. There is some merit to the writing and cinematography. In fact, some would allege that this is undoubtedly the greatest movie released thus far in 2010, and while I'd agree, I'd disagree to the numerous claims about this being one of the greatest films of all time.(some spoilers) I'll start with the characters. I cannot remember any of their names in the movie, except for Leonardo's wife (Mel? or some short name starting with an ""M""). Yes, I cannot even recall what Leonardo's character's name is. I, like several other reviewers, do not think that the movie took enough time to explore the characters and to get a feel for them. I could care less when the heir to the company dies.Of course, the film spends a very large portion of time exploring Leonardo's past. Yet, this time could be better spent doing something else, like creating some more emotion or searching several of the other characters' pasts. His character is extremely stolid throughout the movie, save for some flashbacks and towards the end when he comes to his realization about his wife. I was not incredibly impressed with his performance.Then to the plot, the ever so hard to summarize plot... Well, I can dig intelligent stories, but this story has such a convoluted storyline that it's slightly ridiculous. The story is so complicated that it spends too much time introducing everything and little time developing anything.I feel as though the first 15-20 minutes is completely worthless, for it leaves any viewer clueless and establishes little. Sure, the top (which is a clever motif) makes its first appearance, but its importance is not even discussed until later.And sure, the end forms a sort of thematic circle that leads back to the beginning, but that was absolutely unnecessary because it established nothing. And sure, the idea that the projections in a dream rebel against the dreamer is hinted at as well, but this entire concept is later explained, and no reference to this part is even necessary. Wasted time.One of my major gripes in this film is the wasted time. It dragged because the story spent so much time trying to hammer in Leonardo's story to the point of exhaustion. Yet, with all this time, NONE of it was spent developing any other character. The same people with whom Leonardo would end up trusting his life and mission were simply figures used to further the plot. Useless. It felt at least three and a half hours long to me...Now, my last major gripe is the fact that this is complex purely for the sake of being complex. Yes, I understand the story. Yes, I found it a little entertaining. No, I do not rate this movie highly in my list. Why? Because it is incredibly drawn-out and fairly unoriginal. The concept of going through others' dreams has been done. The concept of ""dream within a dream"" (Edgar Allan Poe) has been done before. The concept of taking a corporation down has been done before. It's simply taking several interesting plot ideas and trying to glue them together. For me, the result is not cohesive enough. Fair enough to those who truly enjoyed the film."
119072,True,"The movie is clearly carried out in two phases: the first one lets you in on what the main character does, hints at the monsters in his closet, and assembles the team to carry out the biggest job of their lives. It is a strained attempt at generating feeling that something big will happen when they get to the second part. The second part is a three-tier dream with a distinct design at each level with an additional fourth one that appears when the bottom drops down.For something as visually elaborate as this film is, it lacks a good character conflict. The action concentrates exclusively on the ever-changing and beautifully executed scenery, but the characters are rather two-dimensional and there is no tension between any of them. The only pseudo-villain that we encounter in the film resides within the main character, and the villainry is better represented through fear it generates in other characters than through its actions. The ""villain"" barks louder than it bites. The film concentrates too heavily on the effects while lacking in basic character development. It ends up being too benign, too flat, too plain.True, there are many good concepts that find representation in the film: the yoga of dreams, lucid dreaming, NLP techniques of programming people into doing what you want, etc. Any somewhat-read person would clearly see the roots of ideas in this movie. The off-the beaten-path-ness of the concepts does not make them brand new, though. And for anyone who reads, this is a rather opportunistic film in a sense that it capitalizes on the fact that most will never read a thing about lucid dreams or anything in that general area of knowledge, thus pitching its concepts to an average film-goer as something revolutionary. Despite tons of visual effects, it is an easy film to follow, perhaps too easy in the light of the hype that leads one to expect more for your brain to feast on. Instead, all your brain gets is crumbs.This film feels like a mutant baby of ""The Cell"" and ""The Matrix"". It is fun to watch at times, although scenes with the main character and his wife are mercilessly stretched, well beyond what is necessary to deliver the idea.It is amazing that the man whose subconscious is penetrated does not put up a better fight despite his training in dream security. On the second level of the dream he just surrenders and is led like a lamb to slaughter. And you say this man was trained to defend himself when someone invades his subconscious? That's a plot hole, and a big one. Besides, who better to play a well-equipped villain than Cillian Murphy? He needs more depth and more screen time than he was given this time around. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, on the other hand, is scrumptious and understatedly sexy, a hot brainiac who can even create a kick in absence of gravity. Now that is impressive. What's a kick? See the movie. Just don't expect too much, if you are a well-read, well-traveled old soul. If not, you are gonna love it."
119073,True,"Christopher Nolan's disappointing follow-up to The Dark Knight has an intriguing enough premise. It's just a pity the man himself couldn't have settled for a ""Story by"" credit and let someone else  perhaps his brother?  take up the quill and ink. Because the only respite we get from the barrage of exposition occurs during one of the many exciting, imaginative action sequences. (The cliff-side finale is not among them, sadly.) Perhaps Nolan wanted to make absolutely sure that the audience knew what was at stake by the time the corridors started to flip and the subconscious snow started tumbling down the mountain. Even his symbolism is spelled out, lest we miss a moment of the craftsman's genius: it's like watching Tarkovsky with the writer's commentary blaring over the top.As you may or may not (or even wish to) know, the plot involves a moody widower (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his team of Wall Street extras infiltrating the subconscious of the son (Cillian Murphy) of a wealthy businessman (Pete Postlethwaite). Being a self-proclaimed mind-bender doesn't excuse the series of convolutions that puts the team at actual risk, but suffice to say, down this deep we're pretty much in the Wes Craven school of dying in your sleep, or near enough.Leonardo DiCaprio is at his spitting best; Joseph Gordon-Levitt is wasted on action duties; Michael Caine is... oh no, he's gone; Marion Cotillard screams like a cat; Tom Hardy shines.For me, the most disappointing aspect lies in the fact that this is a dream film without a single, solitary dream-like image. Nothing uncanny, eerie, unsettling or psychologically askew. Perhaps this is how Nolan dreams  in solidly defined 'levels', with straight-lined origami cities, empty of metaphor or oneiric imagery. Nolan's dreamscape is a pristine museum, carefully and verbosely labelled, occasionally confusing, but not in a fun way; ultimately nothing more than a playground for confident men in tailored suits."
119074,True,"Imagine a world where dreams could be tamed, where they could shared ... where they could be tapped into by others with ulterior motives. Imagine being unable to tell whether you were indeed dreaming or not, being unable to tell if those you were interacting with were merely projections of your subconscious, or enemies from the outside trying to discover your inner-most secrets ... or trying to implant ideas into that subconscious ...Feeling a little warped? Well, that's how I felt about five minutes into this mind-bender starring Leonardo DiCaprio, a movie described by The Rolling Stone as ""James Bond Meets 'The Matrix,'"" and after watching the highly-stylized trailers for this movie by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight""), that's exactly what I expected. And while I'm not one of those idiotic fans who actually believe that actors invent the movie, I was encouraged by Leo's earlier venture this year into movies with more existential themes, ""Shutter Island,"" - an interesting, mildly surprising movie whose twist borrowed heavily from Alejandro Amenábar's ""The Others."" Existential movies, along with the upcoming ""The Adjustment Team"" starring Matt Damon, have piqued my interest with the notion that Hollywood is once again revisiting a genre seemingly forgotten since the turn of the Millennium. ""The Matrix,"" ""Fight Club,"" ""Waking Life,"" ""eXistenZ,"" ""The Thirteenth Floor,"" ""Sixth Sense,"" ""Abre los Ojos / Vanilla Sky"" and ""The Truman Show"" seemed to be an artistic query from the creative world about the nature of our existence in a new era where concepts of religion, nationhood, and individual were starting to lose their original definitions.This year, there seemed to be a re-awakening of this collective self-examination through cinema, and while ""Shutter"" was a nice (but borrowed) first start ... ""Inception"" is a pompous goose-chase. It's premise is as mind-bending as Neo's dialed-in world, but you soon sigh with disappointment as the characters are forced to narrate its many complexities: a maze that is so convoluted, it nearly drowns in its own philosophical holes.At the final scene, you're wondering what you might have missed; the last scene mocking the mental notecard you've been keeping to keep up with the ""dreams-within-a-dream."" Its eXistenZ's-inspired plot is suddenly destroyed by a Bobby Ewing-esquire shower, and you wonder - suddenly - how long you've been duped.Existential movies are by their very nature puzzles. ""Inception"" is a very extraordinary attempt by Christopher Nolan to match the mastery of the Wachowski's brothers' masterpiece ... and it is very noble failure. While the backdrops and CGI is all at-the-ready, what lacks is a consistent vision, metaphorical references, and momentum. It pretends to be a clever ride on the roller-coaster of reality, at a pace so fast that one would almost assume that Nolan is smarter than his viewers. The end is neither satisfying nor clever, and the spinning attempt to keep the viewer pondering ... to me ... is the resignation of Nolan that his story simply ran out of steam.Here's a better idea for your fifteen dollars: put it in a garbage disposal."
119075,True,"Christopher Nolan has once again utterly mastered the intensity of motion picture theatre. Without Christopher Nolan making movies every two years, theatre would be mind-numbing. What Nolan does to make audiences get so intrigued is from his characters. The characters in this film are performed beautifully by some of my favourite actors, and they make the audience believe the story is factual. The best part about ""Inception"" is how Nolan is able to hypnotize the audience, and dispatch us into the dream world, truly making the audience believe they're dreaming themselves. After the ultimate grand dream is over, and all the characters return to the real world, you feel like you were actually dreaming (or watching a dream). It was implausible, and spellbinding to watch. Yes, this film was extraordinarily brilliant. My favourite scene in the entire film was when the van was gradually falling off the bridge, relating to the dream that everyone in that van was having at that specific moment. That scene was vividly done, but also, the whole movie was vividly done. I could never imagine a movie better than ""The Dark Knight,"" but this one completely dominated over Batman's story, intensity, and acting. Christopher Nolan made, pretty much the greatest movie with the greatest idea ever. Unbelievable."
119076,True,"And by deception rather than Inception I am referring to the title of this movie as although the film is good, it's far from brilliant and I have to say I left the cinema feeling rather deceived by all of the great reviews out there from the public and critics alike who had heralded this flick a masterpiece. But a masterpiece it is not. In fact, it's rather derivative from other films Christopher Nolan has directed, including Memento and The Prestige, with shades of 2001 A Space Odyssey permeating the picture as well. Now DiCaprio, of course is mesmerising as always, yet he doesn't really have a lot to do as he mopes about missing his children without really expressing the distress he feels to the audience very well. Sure he anchors in the film, and in a very subtle way, but to subtle for me - almost boring subtle, which really griped me as I prefer his more flamboyant and boisterous roles. Roles he has played in films such as Shutter Island and Blood Diamond really allow him to work those acting chops of his and usually make for a very entertaining film. This film just didn't let him do that. The film, although visually superior to most others out there on the market today, left me with a feeling of boredom at times and by the end I felt the pay off I had been desperately waiting for didn't arrive and instead of sharing the elation of the critics and audience alike I was left with a ""O my God, was that it"" replaying in my mind. So my advice...watch this film by all means, but be warned, that although it is at times intriguing and thought provoking most of the time it's meandering, plodding and ultimately quite pointless. Good but not that good. 6/10 (3*)"
119077,True,"When film-makers make a movie that deals with the human subconscious like inception, they have millions of trinkets to play with. Literally, the film-makers own imagination is the limit.Inception does this very nicely, it creates rules for which the inception (-planting an idea in someone's subconscious while they sleep) takes place, and tries to get the absolute most out of the story, action and graphics within the rules it created for itself for this inception to take place.Even though I found the movie very entertaining, in the end I felt a bit conned. This was because the movie kept telling me over and over again how brilliant it was, and how superbly complex it was, while in fact, it wasn't complex at all. The basic story is very simple actually. It's just made complex with a lot of gimmicks.This isn't really a bad thing, all movies do it. So I wondered whether 'feeling conned' is a good argument. I guess it mainly had to do with the ending of the movie. The ending is a cheap way to have your audience question whether it was real or not. Of course, there is no correct answer. And that's OK. But why ask the question than? If it all wás real in end, the movie is that much better. Now they choose to be oh so 'deep' and 'thoughtful'. Where yet again, it really is not.I guess the 'feeling conned' sentiment comes from all the 'this movie is oh so complex, oh so deep, oh so thoughtful' gestures it makes. But it fails to deliver actual arguments (for me at least)to back that claim up. The gimmicks are (needlessly) complex indeed, the basic story itself is not, not by a long shot.This all sounds very negative, and the movie doesn't deserve it, it's a very good movie and to all the people I know I recommended watching it. Mainly because it spawned interesting conversations. However, that bitter after-taste of 'feeling conned' has made me come to feel this is a movie without heart. To me it seems they didn't want to make this movie so 'complex' and 'deep' because they loved doing so or because the story deserved it. They only did it to try and trick me to think this was a brilliant movie. And when you try to do that with me, I tend to back away.All in all, a very good movie, which left a cheesy after-taste. But at least it was a lot better than the Dark Knight (the directors previous blockbuster) which I found horrendously bad (and over-hyped). So, Final Verdict: 7 It would have been 1 or 2 points higher if the movie had more heart. A lame argument I know, but I don't know how else to put in words."
119078,True,"Dreams are colorless, you can not read in them and you don't dream about dreaming. You might jump from dream to dream and you can live a dream more intensely but you don't dream in a dream. You can not share or enter a dream, it has never been achieved in the least possible way. Lastly if it rains outside you don't obligatory dream about it.If this was only the protagonists dream and he woke up: You can't find catharsis in a dream, you might wake up feeling uneasy from a nightmare or wake up feeling good from a good dream, but that's it.If he didn't: If he fell in a coma from the use of those drugs or whatever, he saw strange dreams, so what? He failed, his wife failed to bring him back, no point.If he did went home and things are what they appear to be the plot holes are abundant: 1. If you can get you hands on the president and CEO of a multinational conglomerate you don't need his secrets to begin with. Those sections are ridiculous, Saito and Fischer should have an army of bodyguards or at least some aids around them at all times. 2. Why Saito hire Cobb? He fail to extract from him. 3. Why don't they know Fischer is trained? That is the only thing they had to make sure and triple check. 4. When they wake up why they are not angry at Coob for lying to them and the danger he put them through? 5. What scum sends a little college girl on a job like this? 6. They plan to stay in the dream for ten years but when cornered they make stuff up, succeed and are out in a day. Why not plan that from the beginning? 7. Inception is easy. Take some random numbers from the victim, put them as combination on a safe that you made, disguise yourself ala mission impossible and voilà. Why doesn't everybody doing it? 8. Fischer is specially trained for just this kind of thing but doesn't have a totem to blow the hole plan apart? 9. Mal jumped from another hotel room, isn't there a paper trail or forensic evidence to that room? Or even a single witness? Being declared sane by three different psychiatrists does not look strange at the polices eyes? 10. If you want to see your children put them on a plane, make a video call, have them send pictures for god sake. 11. The entire rule set of the dreams is illogical in its own context and the time passing between the tree layers makes no sense, nor could it make because of its complexity. It would need an entire book to be attempted at.Artistically it is shot with skill, it is immersing, the effects are good and I did watched all of it for the cinematography. But pointless is pointless.Also when movies end this way, meaning with two options for the viewer, either he is still dreaming or he woke up, does not make a good movie or a good ending. Good ending makes open interpretation from many points of view, for characters ultimate motives, for questions of what is done is done for good or ill, etc. Here the characters are evil and they want to destroy thousand of peoples lives(Destroying Fischer company) for money, Cut and dry.To conclude I want to say that this has nothing to do with dreams. Dreams do not work that way, we all know that. This is a sci-fi movie about how dreams might have worked but even in that context doesn't make sense like I said. Watch but don't take seriously."
119079,True,"Well that's a pointless 2 hours and 33 minutes of my life I'm not getting back.The praise lavished on this movie is more indicative of the lack of any originality at all today in Hollywood rather than the qualities of the movie itself.Great as the concept is Philip K Dick came up with much more outlandish ideas that he just wrote up as short stories and novels forty years ago - many of them having proved impossible for the movie business to translate even with modern imagery.Don't get me wrong, the images along the way and performances are outstanding but the trite ""Are we still dreaming?"" ending is unoriginal and actually just hollows the entire film. I also guessed it from about ten minutes in. By the end I frankly couldn't have cared less."
119080,True,"Inception Nolans latest effort is a cleverly constructed and beautifully executed sci-fi thriller, apparently he first pitched the idea to WB in 2003 and then went away to write a script he thought would be finished in a few months, 8 years later the film is released and it's no wonder it took so long to complete. The film follows Cobb (Leonadro Di Caprio), who specialises in entering people's dreams and stealing valuable secrets his employers. We open with Cobb in the mind of Saito(Ken Watanabe); a business tycoon he needs to retrieve secret documents from, but things go horribly wrong when the subconscious projection of his former wife enters the dream and betrays him. Cobb and his partner Arthur (Joseph-Gordon Levitt) are forced to flee the country as their employers will not tolerate failure, but Saito tracks them down and makes them an offer; Inception. If they can successfully plant an idea into the mind of one of Saitos competitors Saito will pull the strings necessary to grant Cobb the freedom to go back to America and see his kids again. Cobbs team is consists of Arthur, Yusuf the chemist (Dileep Rao), Eames (Tom Hardy), Adriadne the architect (Ellen Page) who is responsible for creating the dream. Nolan not only manages to create a wonderful story, but also adds his own cyberpunk dialogue to the mix. 'Riding the kick', 'Totems', 'Projections', they all add substance to the world he has created. The origins of this technology are not explored, in fact it's more of an alternate reality than a story set in the future, but it's a world constructed with such attention to detail that it feels real. What follows is a complex but not overly contrived series of dreams within dreams in order to plant the idea deep enough for it to stick. It's a mixture of theft and business espionage that provides a setting for some wonderful visuals, and in the end the only limitation is the mind of Nolan himself. One scene where Arthur is fighting off the projections of the target inside a rotating corridor is thrilling to watch in all its nauseating vertigo, whilst Cobbs training of Adriadne provide the artistic license to pull a whole host of crazy special effects. Cities bend in half, mirrors smash and turn into streets, it's a world of unlimited potential. Di Caprio once again proves that he knows how to pick a movie, his Scorsese partnership rarely disappoints, but Nolan has provided the platform for another successful performance. Joseph-Gordon Levitt is able to play his role with both suave coolness and perfectly timed comedic relief, whilst Ellen Page uses her indie image to convey a female lead devoid of the usual stereotypes. The rest of the supporting cast all do a fine job, especially Cillian Murphy as the mind-invaded and emotionally manipulated target of the Inception.After watching this film I'm still convinced Nolan boasts a flawless oeuvre, every one demonstrates a clear talent for script-writing. Insomnia may be the weakest of them all and it will come as no surprise it's the only film he had no hand in writing in. Nolan however could not resist one final teaser to the audience with Inception. As the film concludes and we are left satisfied with the arc of our protagonist, the camera pans away on to the perpetually spinning totem. As it is about to topple the film cuts away, now I don't think Nolan is seriously trying to imply that Cobb is dreaming, instead I think it's his own clever Inception. To plant an idea into the minds of the audience and watch it grow."
119081,True,"I'm gonna go with the former, although something in my brain pan keeps coming back to the movie's casual mention (twice) that the rich and powerful central figure who is the target of Cobb's team of dream invaders carries a $500 wallet. Who would pay that much for a wallet? I mean, what could a wallet have that would make it worth that much? I couldn't shake this question about money foolishly spent.Watching this, admittedly, amazingly entertaining but absurdly complicated movie does make you stop and say, ""Wait a minute, I want to see the flow chart."" Plot points race past at breakneck speed. Do they go down three or four dream levels? Why did Leo inception his wife? Was the eroding seashore city limbo? Why were they all tied together and floating in the elevator? How did Cobb ""betray"" the team with memories of his wife?Perhaps repeat viewings will make all this clear. If anything, Inception is a movie that will have audiences back for a second viewing to try and clear things up.In a word, Inception is a movie that has its way with you. You are helpless in its clutches. A freight train crashing through rush hour traffic? Check. Siege of a mountain fortress with avalanche thrown in for good measure? Check. Paris folds in on top of itself? Check. Volcanic Hans Zimmer soundtrack? Check.Oh, and machine gun warfare. Lots of machine gun warfare.And then there's that hotel hallway fight. Whoa. One for the books."
119082,True,"The worst cinema experience of my entire life.My wife had seen it before, yet she still recommended that we go and see it together when it did the local rounds. I should have suspected something when she described it as 'strange'.Don't waste two hours of your precious blood flow for this. Pure Hollywood indulgence. Pure nonsense. Good luck to them for making money.Horrendous noisy music score. Loads of gratuitous violence, people get shot dead yet that is deemed acceptable in dream world.I am really angry that I wasted money on this utter drivel.By the way, I did not like it."
119083,True,"Dear Mr. Nolan.I am writing to you about that movie you made, ""Inception"".I am sorry but I have to tell you that I find it really annoying.The only part I liked is when Leo and the girl sit in the café and he explains to her that it is a shared dream they're creating. Then she walks around and tinkers with the dream world as she pleases.Which means doing stuff that is interesting to look at yet ultimately totally pointless. While people walk by and stare at her. Yeah, seriously. That's all they do. What an interesting dream. You know I can have that (the staring part) in real life whenever I want to, I don't need to (or want to) go to the cinema for that.Some physics experiments later Leo goes on to tell her that, for some reason, he doesn't like it when she recreates large chunks of her real memories in the dream world.Huh you say? Yeah, I say that too.Supposedly it is because that sort of creative action ""makes her lose grip on what's real and what's not"".Uhm. You know what? That is just nonsense. You can create dream worlds all day long and it does not make you lose any grip on anything.Sadly, the movie goes steeply downhill from there.Music that is supposed to sound ominous sets in and never stops for the rest of the movie. It's the kind of atmosphere that tells me right away that whatever happens on screen is not worth watching because it's just frightened clueless people telling each other ""serious stuff"". Kinda like politicians talking to each other. I hope you forgive me that I skipped through most of this while watching the movie.After a lot of that BS a guy who is in way too many movies (Michael Caine), appears and the flick ends.Here is the larger picture.""Inception"" is part of what I call the ""New American Madness"". Movies of despair, disjointed, logic falling apart, stories making no sense. Everything always seems dangerous and ominous, but nobody knows why and nothing leads anywhere.The cinema worlds of the New American Madness can be seen as a reflection of America's wars in Iraq (halfway past), Afghanistan (current) and North America (upcoming) which are really nothing but large-scale implementations of insanity. You really shouldn't think about this stuff too much lest you like to go insane yourself.To sum this up, Mr. Nolan: Please find a proper story writer for your next movie. ""Memento"" was so, so, so good. wtf happened to you after that?Nevertheless! You are without doubt a talented artist and I wish you the best of luck for future endeavors. You might want to consider joining the peace movement which I happen to be spearheading.Greetings, New Spirit Jazz"
119084,True,"Inception. I've seen it two times, and I plan to see it at least one more time before it's out of theaters. Let me tell you, I'm still shocked. It's one of the hardest movies to understand, mainly because it's so open to interpretation. I love it. I love, love, love it. The great thing about this movie is that it is what you want it to be. It's like a fully customizable film. You see yourself in the characters, you feel what they're feeling, and you get just as lost in the dreams as they do. It's slowly but surely working it's way up my favorite movie list.Now there's a lot of different theories swirling around out there about how the story is meant to be taken. I've read a lot of them, and this is what I, personally, have decided about the film.I think what you see is what you get. When Cobb claims it's reality, it is. The movie takes place on two parallel planes, our reality and our dreams, and they navigate deep into one and return to the other. It is what it is. As for the ending... I personally think he's awake, back in reality, and finally reunited with his kids. I know it's very unclear and a lot of people don't see it that way, but it goes back to this movie being what you want it to be. I want it to be a happy ending with him living in this world and being with his kids.In contradiction to what I just said, I also think that it doesn't entirely matter if his totem falls or not. The point is that he is a changed man. He's let go of his guilt and he's ready to accept his fate as long as he's with his children. In a way, his guilt was his totem and he was battling it, trying to grasp the reality of his feelings throughout the movie. He came back to what was important after he let go of Mal's death.I also read somewhere that this was nothing more than an allegory for filmmaking. It makes perfect sense. Cobb is the director, in charge of creating the dream, or the allegorical movie. Arthur would be the producer type, gathering all the information so the dream/movie goes off without a hitch. Ariadne is the screenwriter, creating the world that the Mark, Robert Fischer (representative of the movie's audience) sees. Eames represents the actor, changing faces and playing characters. Saito would represent the guy from the production company that wants in on the making of the film to make sure it's getting done, and Yusuf is the technical guy who's pretty much responsible for making things run smoothly on the outside. When you look at it that way, it makes perfect sense. Even Mal has her place. She represents what happens when a director brings their ""personal touch"" into a movie. It can make things more interesting, but can also kill the Mark/audience. Alas, Fischer is saved, and at the conclusion of the dream, he is a changed man. The dream/movie implanted an idea in him, and in the slightest way, altered him. And then the ending also makes sense. The director, Cobb, goes home changed too, and it doesn't entirely matter that the movie was fake, it changed everyone involved, including the audience. Nolan, the movies physical director, wouldn't do this picture until he had some experience with big movie franchises. Was that research? Who knows. I love this standpoint though, and while it may have been done intentionally, the movie seems a bit hefty to be solely about making a movie. I think the symbolism in it is beautiful, and I think that what I just typed out is very accurate, but the movie is so much more than that.The movie itself IS an inception. This is my favorite part - You get lost in the dreams just as the characters do. You lose track of where you are, which dream level you're on, who's dream you're in... it all gets so scattered, and it's great. It's kind of like an existential-meta-fiction blend. The movie plants doubt in your mind, it plants ideas in your mind, and most of all it plants thoughts in your mind. I guarantee after you see it, and you're truly immersed in it, you won't stop thinking about it.10/10. Way to go, Chris Nolan."
119085,True,"Have you ever managed to remember the beginning of a dream? Somethings stated in this film were small but true statements. The bizarre things that happen in a dream only appear weird when you wake up. The mind is constantly justifying your mental image with reality.In so saying, Christopher Nolan's 10 years in the making idea offers true science fiction with an all star ensemble cast which in my opinion is noteworthy in its self (I've always been of the opinion that you put too many stars in one movie it usually saturates it with personality conflicts that ooze onto the big screen and lessen the experience). The scope, both in depth and presentation show that it was loved and nursed from concept with just enough technology to create a world that would comfortably accommodated one foot in cold reality and one foot in womb of dream. The good thing is that you can appreciate the movie without intimately following the plot, the bad thing is that you can get very lost if you need to use the facilities. The use of dreams is not a new idea as a vehicle to present a story, I guess the closest thing that would compare to it for me would be ""The Matrix"". What Matrix misses though is, and rightfully so is humanity. Where Matrix is program driven, Inception is almost completely driven by primal needs and the vehicle that fuels it was developed by none other than the military. Once the tools to define and control the dream life of a human being fall into the hands of a special ""underground"" group of people, then we start seeing the dangers of manipulating the fabric of time and space. For DiCaprio's portrayal of Cobb with a dark secret and the mission/job he has been offered that would allow this dark secret to be at peace, the focus is set (and mind you, pay attention because it is easy to loose your perspective through the multiplicity of the story).I am a baby boomer, and as such a person who see's retirement within reach have memories of shows like the original Mission Impossible. Inception follows the Mission Impossible time line closely: 1. You have a potential customer that has an interest in your product and you let him sample it. Out of this, he hires you to do a specific job. However, it goes further than you normally go - which is you are not just getting information willingly out of a target, but also implanting an idea so he believes in the end it is his own. the game is a-foot. 2. You assemble your team. You find an architect, an apothecary, a forger, weapons master... etc. 3. You find your best option for deploying your plan. 4. You initiate your plan. 5. You improvise as needs fit in adverse conditions. 6. You accomplish your goal. 7. You all depart with slight nods and smiles as you move on to bigger and better things.I have seen this now twice, which for me was necessary; some things just didn't make sense to me at the start but came clear during a second sitting (2.5 hours long too... so don't drink all your water or eat all your popcorn in the first 30 minutes, or use the facilities during the movie). The only teaser I will part is that the ending justifies the job. Please, don't take children to this movie. It is dark, the music is repetitive and builds throughout the movie (reminded me almost of a 007 theme), there are lots of surprise explosions that are loud - I say this because some stupid 30 year old man bought an 8 month old infant to the theater and sat in the second row from the screen. My opinion he should have been locked up for his arrogant selfishness. This movie is also offered with D-Box motion seat signal which is kind of entertaining. We sat in the row in front of the D-Box section and the floor was constantly vibrating during loud sequences. The experience of this film for me was a 10. The plot was a 10. The acting was a 9 as was the music. The FX were seamless and a 9.Another must see in the theater A-list. Enjoy. -B"
119086,True,"Where do I begin? Hmmm, where can I describe how amazing this movie is. I really do not know how to tell the reader of this article without spoiling? Well, I am only going to ask the reader to take my word for it. Now, my reviews are not well received and dismissed as useless. I want to try to be as helpful as possible, I will make this review quick. I do not want to ramble on and on and bore the reader. I will state that I am a Christopher Nolan fan. In fact, I think he's on of the best filmmakers of all time. People told me it was too early to tell when Dark Knight came out but after viewing Inception, it proved my point. Inception is not only the best movie of the summer, the year, it's also one of the best movies ever made. It really is amazing, I can't even think of ONE flaw in it. It's really hard to describe the plot but I can throw this out there, it's very intelligent. It's a great story about dreams. It's like the Matrix with a hint of Memento. However, it's it's own movie and it's rich and original. It's also well acted. I also want to point out the obvious is the visuals. Man let me tell you, it is pretty to look at. Nolan manages to make pretty visuals without the need to use a lot of CGI. In fact, the movie hardly had any CGI it was pretty much all compositing with actual shot footage. Which in my opinion made the movie look more real. He manages to also make the movie trippy without going overboard. This is as far as I am going to tell about Inception I do not want to spoil anything. Plus, I am too tired to write a long review. I wanted to sum it up with a short review. I am sure nobody will find this article useful but meh, I just want to give out my opinion. If you like Blade Runner, Matrix and Nolan films in general, this is a great movie to check out. It will go in the history books as one of the best scifi movies. It's a must see on the IMAX, trust me on that one. Also, Nolan, he better get an Oscar. He seriously deserves one more than any filmmaker right now. He's magical and I don't think he knows how to make bad movies. He only knows epic and awesome. Thank you Christopher Nolan."
119087,True,"I want to start out by saying I don't think that the story is any way a rehash of the Matrix, like some critics seem to be saying. The Matrix dealt with other ideas about humanity, the dependency on machines, etc.Let me also say before I begin: This movie is VERY VERY HARD TO FOLLOW. IT IS IN NO WAY A POPCORN MOVIE, IF YOU WATCH MOVIES TO TURN OFF YOUR MIND (there's nothing wrong with that, either) THIS IS NOT YOUR MOVIE! I had to tell my family what was going on at certain times, though I'm not sure I caught everything, because they brought up things that I had to forget to keep up with the movie.Alright, to the actual review... but where do I begin? For my own sake I'll start with the cast. This is a strange group of people. Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Page isn't the first powerhouse combo that comes to mind for me, and some of the cast is from Nolan's Batman Begins. This cast works very well together, I heard a colleague say that this may be the best work Leo has ever done. I'm not going to go as far as to say that, because I haven't seen very many movies with Leo in general. He does, though, do a fantastic, job, equivalent of Pacino in The Godfather and Freeman and Robbins in The Shawshank Redemption. The rest of the cast does a great job too (though Ken Watanabe was sort of hard to understand at times). This though, is also thanks to how well Christopher Nolan was able to attach us to this cast, and with how little background he gave us to work with on everyone other than Cobb (relatively speaking, it still wasn't that much) I thought that was very impressive.Next, I suppose I'll talk about the effects. Hands down this movie has some of the coolest fight scenes in the movie industry, from shifting gravity to anti-gravity, puzzle paradoxes to the mind's defenses. This movie also promised cool effects in the trailer, believe me when I say that it delivered, if you just let the movie happen and for the entire 2 and 1/2 hours allow the movie reality in, I promise you'll be blown away.Now, this is the hardest part for me: the plot. This is by far the most complicated movie I've ever seen in my life. The plot is just plain hard to follow, in a good way, it is, in many ways, like a game of chess where you don't know what the other person is up to. Chris Nolan plays said game very well. I can't describe how difficult it was to follow this movie at some points, because of the different ""dream levels"" it goes to, but beyond that you tend to forget whose dream it was to begin with (in a sort of dream-within-a-dream concept). This doesn't help because of Cobb's past, and the fact that his subconscious is waging war on him the entire time. IF YOU DON'T WANT THE ENDING RUINED PLEASE STOP THIS PARAGRAPH HERE AND CONTINUE ON TO THE NEXT ONE. Now the important part: the ""twist"". The problem is, that the twist may or may not exist, because the ending of the movie leaves it open to interpretation. Believe me when I say that's infuriating, but at the same time fantastic, especially because the movie is so airtight that ""plot-holes"" (believe me, that could just be rationalizing) which could turn it one way or another actually open a new path for explanation, and are actually explainable no matter the circumstances, because it is a dream after all.I stayed up until two thinking the night after watching this movie, I couldn't figure it out, it's like a puzzle where all the pieces but the edges are the same, and you can make a picture with more than one arrangement of the pieces, and that doesn't even take rotation of the pieces into account. So what did I think overall? It was quite possibly the greatest movie I've ever seen (a title that hasn't been overthrown since I saw Pulp Fiction). This is only after watching it once, my opinion could change with time (though I doubt it), and the few more viewings that I'm bound to do. But as of now, this is one of the greats, maybe the greatest."
119088,True,"I've said that about so many movies but the euphoria passes about some time after it's done. So I figured I'd wait 24 hours to see if this euphoria has passed... looks like it hasn't. V For Vendetta was my favorite movie, I now have to reconsider.Inception is an AMAZING movie. For one, it has one of the most interesting plots I've ever had the good fortune to witness. Look at it. Stealing/planting ideas through dreams. Entering others' dreams. Completing tasks in dreams. This stuff is what I like. The plot was very complex and multi-layered, and therefore there was so much to offer in the plot. Not a single moment went by where I wasn't interested.The visuals are AMAZING. I was blown away when Cobb was showing Ellen Page how the dream world worked, with the folding city. As well as the scenery in the Arctic. The sets looked vivid and gorgeous. They complemented the film's great plot and IMO, were very creepy and brooding too.Another reason the movie is so great is because it uses ambiguity THE RIGHT WAY. A lot of filmmakers (*ahem* Michael Haneke, I'm looking at you!!!!) think that senseless manipulation equals a great movie (to a lot of people nowadays think it does and because of it, they rave about it like it's second coming of Jesus), and this one doesn't senselessly manipulate the viewer. It challenges the viewer to piece together the puzzle and find out the answer. Yet it has plenty of exciting action and suspense to offer, and it doesn't beat you over the head with the theme. You're getting your adrenaline up during the action while simultaneously piecing the puzzle together.The ending. WOW. I'll be thinking about this one for at least a month. It uses ambiguity the right way too- I am personally leaning towards the ""he's still dreaming"" side, but I definitely like the ending a lot because he could be in the real world too. My friend and I both decided last night that he's lost his mind and is in limbo, but that's what makes the ending so powerful. You interpret it your own way. See this is what I wish a lot of the pretentious directors who go for the ""open to interpretation"" approach did more often- end it AFTER the resolution of the conflict and then leave the one element up to the viewer to decide. It can be interpreted many ways.The movie is VERY long. 2 hours 28 minutes. But it didn't feel long at all!! I seriously thought it was only 1 hour 45 minutes. That's the thing, when you're so into a movie, when your attention is drawn to it for that long, when you're trying to piece together the puzzle, time flies so fast. I didn't even get up from my seat once and mind you I'm VERY bad for having to go to the bathroom.Last night I lay wide in bed thinking about the movie. I tried to sleep but I couldn't. The movie was very powerful, it made me think about it. I was thinking about it on the way home from the IMAX. My friend and I were talking about it the whole way (and ruining it for people on the bus lol). It goes to show you how powerful a movie can be. It leaves you thinking, and I'm STILL thinking about it as I type this. I am really glad I saw it.As over the top as I may sound, I am not trying to sound over the top. I really loved it. WAY more than the Dark Knight. I'm seeing it again on Wednesday, and I cannot wait. This movie is the best movie I've seen this year and maybe the best I've seen in general (I do not make that up, and have seen several movies in a lifetime alone)."
119089,True,"Once in a while comes a movie that changes our perception of movie-making! For Nolan, its just another day's work. As Inception, the most highly anticipated movie of the summer, gets brains and brawls just in the right proportion to make the perfect summer movie. Inception is an intelligent, innovative, ingenious, intriguing movie. To cut a long story short, its Incredible.Dom Cobb (CAPRIO in YET another great role) masters the art of stealing ideas from a person's dream. He helps his clients in corporate espionage and that makes him an internationally wanted fugitive. But it is not only the Law that chases him, as the memories of his deceased wife Mallorie (CORTILLAD) keeps on haunting his mind. He is helped by his researcher Arthur (GORDON-LEVITT) in entering a target's mind. Desperate to get home, he takes on a daring last mission for Saito (WATANABE) that requires him to enter a corporate head Fischer's (MURPHY) mind NOT to steal an idea but to INCEPT one. He is also helped by a dream architect Ariadne (PAGE), a chemist who specializes in sedatives (RAO) and a forger who can impersonate another inside a dream Eames (HARDY) in this job. But, as all Nolan fans can expect, things don't as planned. The rest is for you to catch at a theater near you.The story is tense, deep and disturbing. The tension is taut and it hardly ever slackens. The dreams within dreams within dreams concept is complex to say the least. It requires complete attention from the viewer if he wants to decipher every little puzzle the movie throws. The acting is top-notch. The all-star cast (with special appearances by Nolan's favorite Michael Caine and the ever-dependable Pete Postlethwaite) delivers superbly. The haunting music by Hans Zimmer deserves a special mention. The visuals are very good and intelligently made.All in all, the year's best movie yet (and should be till the year end), that requires multiple viewing for complete understanding and is poised to be THE cult classic of the decade! Take a bow, Nolan! Your ideas will be worth the steal!"
119090,True,"This is a movie that definitely was majorly hyped as Matrix meets James Bond. It was neither. The plot is very confused and unless you want to start a chart be prepared to miss a few things here and there. One reviewer earlier said you have to watch it at least twice to understand it. REALLY??? A dream inside a dream inside another dream and inside yet another dream only to realize at the end the whole movie was a dream so it was yet another layer deep. Please.... just tell the story. A 2 hour plus movie that shows the same flashbacks again and again just to prove the the lead character is deeply mourning and hiding something. I swear if I saw the same cutaway scene of his 2 kids again I was going to scream.The graphics are mediocre at best... CGI is CGI it's not new guys. Just because you can bend a street..... doesn't make it as ground breaking as Matrix... whoopee! As for James Bond.... not really. A few gun battles and a grenade don;t make you a James Bond. Besides James Bond is based on a character who fights for queen and country.... not to rip off a company for personal gains. At best these scenes are comparable to a first person shooter like Battlefield.The main character played by Leo is the same character over and over from him. Shutter Island, The Aviator, The Island, etc is a deeply troubled character with secrets which end up cursing the main character to sacrifice. It's tried and boring from Leo... branch out buddy... your not getting any younger.Overall, this was just not as hyped as a lot of movies are these days. A movie that is about 30 minutes longer than it should and with high priced talent which could have been performed better by lesser more able actors.... I say save your $15 and wait a few months till its on HBO"
119091,True,"Just one advice ! - Keep AWAY from this nightmare ! 2.5 hours of boring, boring and once more boring thing (cannot even call it a movie). Stupid idea, veeeery slow action and absolutely nothing new what we haven't seen before. I do not understand why Leonardo Di Caprio who used to be for me some kind of guarantee of a good fun decided to take a part in this disaster. The same about Michael Caine. And one more thing - music: the most disturbing and annoying movie soundtrack I ever listened to... they should be returning money for tickets !"
119092,True,"A corporate billionaire wants to eliminate his competition by implanting an idea in the subconscious of the man who stands to inherit the fortune, that he should dismantle the company into smaller entities. He hires Cobb (DiCaprio) to do this, who enlists a team. They tether together in dreams through a low-tech contraption that is never explained, which also puts them to sleep instantly.To implant this idea in the man's mind, they have to go very deep, a dream within a dream, within a dream, within a dream. Down three layers. In each successive layer time speeds up so that hours in layer three is a few minutes in layer two, and seconds in layer one. To go three layers deep they need to take a sedative that is specially designed to deaden everything but the inner ear, so that the feeling of free-fall (called a KICK) will cause the subject to wake up. But one catch: using the sedative, if they die in the dream, their mind goes to ""limbo"" in real life, apparently a coma-like state.They need about 10 hours to accomplish their task. Luckily for them, the target (the billionaire's son) takes a plane from Paris to LA regularly, and the flight is 10 hours. Arrangements are made so the private jet has mechanical problems forcing the target to take a commercial jet. To ensure they won't be disturbed in first class, the billionaire who hatched this plan buys the airline ""because it seemed neater."" The dreamers carry their own talisman that reveals to the dreamer if they are awake or dreaming. Cobb has a small top that spins infinitely while dreaming, but in waking state it eventually topples. (How the other talismans work is never explained. Arthur has a loaded dye and the girl makes a chess-like piece. We never see them use theirs to check their state of reality, but Cobb uses his twice.)The details of how lucid dreaming works is conveniently concocted for the film. One of the dreamers constructs a world in the form of a maze for everyone else to use as the dreamscape. The subconscious mind of the target fills the landscape with their unguarded thoughts, allowing someone to steal their thoughts (or plant a thought). A dreamer can also introduce fears and guilt into the landscape which materialize as threats, buildings crumbling, etc.Cobb doesn't tell his team that he is deeply conflicted about planting a thought (inception) in his wife's mind, which was to question her reality. He did this while they lucid-dreamed together, which became an addiction, gradually revealed throughout the film as backstory. She finally jumped out a window to kill herself and wanted him to commit suicide with her, so before she jumped, she sent a letter to her lawyer saying her husband wanted her dead. Knowing he would get blamed for her suicidal jump, he fled the country to Paris and the entire movie takes place abroad. His drive to help the billionaire is a promised call 'to the right people' that will allow him to return home to be reunited with his two children. Cobb's guilty subconscious kept bringing his dead wife into the dreamscapes where she tries to kill others.The dream sequences themselves are long, drawn out, convoluted, and often boring. They try to distract you from this by having constant gunfire from ""projections"" that are nearly always attacking the main characters. The villain of the movie was psychological: Cobb's inner struggle. That was a major weakness because there was nothing to root against. And you don't care about the main objective either (the billionaire's plan)  in fact the target is a more appealing character than anyone else in the film. So the only reason to sit through the entire movie is to see if Cobb gets to go home in the end, and frankly it takes the entire movie (if you don't walk out) to care about that too. And by then the only reason you care is b/c you sat through 2.5 hrs to see how it ends.The best scene, dramatically, is when they wake on the plane and each look at one another after going through so much (~2hrs worth!) in dream state. The billionaire makes a phone call as the plane lands in LA, and Cobb clears customs. He is met by his Father (or his ex wife's father?) who takes him home. Cobb walks into the house, sees his children playing outside (as we have seen in many sequences throughout the movie) but this time he calls their names, and they turn around and look at him. At the same time he drops his bags, and as a last action, takes out his talisman and spins in on the table, then rushes to greet his kids. We hold on it in foreground while he picks up his children in background.... zooming in on the spinning talisman until it occupies the entire screen.... spinning, spinning spinning.... it starts to wobble ever so slightly... and CUT TO BLACK. Leaving viewers unsure if Cobb was still dreaming.The ending was good and there were two other noteworthy scenes. One is a fight scene in zero gravity in dream layer two, and another was in the movie trailer: the dreamscape curling in on itself to form a cube.Unfortunately, I didn't care about any of the characters nor was there any emotional investment in the main plot. Who cares if a billionaire gets his competition to breakdown his empire? And I also didn't care much if Cobb was reunited with his kids, as there is one lone scene of a phone call he makes to them that is supposed to establish our emotional investment, and it fell way short of doing that. Finally, as previously stated, there is no villain except for Cobb's guilt over his wife's death. I struggled to sit through this film."
119093,True,"As much as I really wanted to enjoy this film, it took me all my patience to be able to sit through the whole debacle.Anyone who expected anything as good as The Matrix will be sadly disappointed. I am astonished at the positive reviews this film has received so far.As an idea, this could have been genius.Instead it was a drawn out, over complex, sleep inducing nightmare for us.Dicaprio looked like he had stayed on Shutter Island.The only redeeming actor was the young Ellen Page who was excellent.Sorry folks but i'm just being honest-an appalling film."
119094,True,"""Inception"" is a decent science fiction/ thriller which balance very well the action, the drama, and the suspense.The direction is good, with a decent visual presentation, strong performances, good character development and a story which is entertaining enough to keep my interest during the whole thing. Despite the fact that I consider that would have been much better present the dream world from a more ""imaginative"" or surreal perspective rather than the realistic approach done by Nolan in this movie, I guess that was point, portraying dreams that were hard to distinguish from reality. And in that aspect, this doesn't disappoint. I guess that this movie would be more appreciated for the public if it wasn't for the massive amounts of hype that it received after it was released: Personally I don't think that it's the outstanding masterpiece than some critics and the supporters have proclaimed, but it is a good film anyway, which qualifies as a decent entertainment.""Inception"" is worth-watching, but don't expect it to be a life-changing experience."
119095,True,"I'm afraid I failed to see the genius so many others apparently did. The nested dream concept was crafted well, but it quickly became stale. The film was not difficult to follow and didn't leave me wanting to see more. The climax had me checking the time, wondering when it would be over. I would rate it a 7 except there was too much non-essential breakage. I understand the notion of the dreamer's defense / attacking the invaders, etc., but the destruction seemed gratuitous and detracted from what, otherwise, could have been a much more cleverly delivered story. Then again, perhaps the experience was partially ruined by all the adulation heaped on the film before I got around to seeing it. If you have high standards for calling something brilliant or genius, Inception will probably leave you a bit disappointed."
119096,True,"Wow. What I read here is really crazy. People talk about INCEPTION as if it invented film all over again.Only few, more down-to-earth reviewers here see this movie as what it really is. An entertaining blockbuster.I don't want to talk about the good things in this movie cause they are obviously more obvious than the bad things. And you will find these in the countless positive reviews. Don't get me wrong. I liked it (7/10 rating from me), I just didn't love it as much as most of the internet seemingly does.People say this movie is so complex and amazingly scripted etc. That's just not true. At least not in relation to the amok running hype! Don't confuse complex with complicated! Inception is ""just"" complicated with all its levels and kicks. It's a complicated universe which needs a lot of explaining (which is done in a hell of a lot dialogs merely there to talk to the audience directly rather than developing the characters, who are actually saying the words. For screenwriters in most cases this would be considered bad writing!). Once understood, these wild explanations, which neglect reason in more than many cases, somehow seem to strike people as 'complex'. --The 'wow-effect' takes over, intelligent entertainment is seen and the best thing is, I totally get it.-- Amazing? No. Complex is a movie like ""12 angry men"", 12 wildly different characters sitting in one room, unpredictably interacting with each other all at once. Or a movie like ""Heat"", where the emotionally torn good and evil parts meet in a grey zone, where moral is not the answer to everything. 'Complex' rather describes the depth of character and haunting situation they are in, than the outer machinery, the mere workflow of the universe they encounter (like in Inception). The characters in inception are totally one dimensional, almost clichéd and driven by typical, standard motivations. Which is not necessarily bad, but just not very complex! Take away the sci-fi mechanism of the dream worlds and you are left with a pretty standard heist movie with fabulous SFX and one or two nice but predictable twists. And yes an open ending 'that totally stuck with me for days'... NOT.Mediocre characters, silly/unmotivated shoot-outs (the ski scene fell right out of a James Bond movie) and, considering the self-seriousness, often unbelievable, ridiculous details. I have to say that I expected more, I expected that very complexity I just described. More depth in character would have been better than the endless depth of dreams. At least for my taste. Still I saw a very good, refreshing, original blockbuster. So this movie is no disastrous disappointment. And I recommend it with a lot of popcorn. I am only disappointed that a movie like this is hailed as a modern masterpiece. I find that a ridiculous statement - but maybe the audiences have been so numbed by the brainless remake-, sequel and franchise-blockbustery in the past years that they mistake this good film as the one that will change filmmaking forever and pave the way into an era of semi-intelligent cinema. Camelsh**. For those who don't know it: intelligent cinema does exist already. You just may not find it among titles that cost 160 mil to make and have that 25 percent shoot-out and fight scenes people's eyes seemingly need to stay focused to the screen.Anyway we all agree, I guess, in hoping that the big studios take Inception as a good example, showcasing high budget productions should take more risks in creating and producing undigested, original material. And for that, granted, Inception may go down as a landmark after all.Considering that, the box office needs your vote. So go see it."
119097,True,"Here's the rub. Although I am astounded by the layering, scene and editing logistics and other details of the movie, the experience left me underwhelmed. The are so much information to take in, more than usual for your average that while there are down times (I'll come back to this) they are not enough - and felt rush for a 2.5 hr movie. I wouldn't mind 3hr (maybe better yet as a series???! or a book even). And yet the focusing character is Cobb, a veteran of the trade, rather than the new comer - Ellen Page's character. So you must pick-up concepts like extraction, inception, dream times, totem, kicker, limbo in a hurry without laying any significant weight to these concepts. Especially in the scene on limbo? Mind you the movie repeats these to you - in earnest plot line no less.This is one information overloaded action movie, but then there's action loaded on top in the 3rd act! Which I found unnecessary or set at the wrong location as one of the character explained it. This is a concept movie, and should have stayed that way - use words, use dramatic pauses, use ideas ? Such that the sequence in discussing and finalizing the wording of the inception concept felt dry, washed over, had no sense of - achievement. -- added And I'll be darn that a friend mention this kind of plot hole : Knowing how ambiguous the ending is, but yet clearly stately throughout the first 1/2 of the film that the 'wife' character is so much of a risk. It was a wash over in the end how DiCaprio's character brushes off and not struggle a bit more ??????Thinking back, memento, prestige and dark knight in their own right were better in terms of pacing, tempo change, and focus. Although even Dark Knight had a issue of who's the lead - Batman or Joker? (But I understand the juxtapose of the 2 - starts off Bat, changed to Joker mid way, then change back?)And the back story for Cobb - kind of cliché????? You see it coming ??"
119098,True,"I have a pretty high standard when it comes to the re-interpretation of dreams (or the workings of the mind in general) by filmmakers which is likely due to the fact that I myself am a dreamer. There is nothing more irksome than these half-conceived, mostly contrived dalliances that are gobbled up by the ever passive viewing public as if they were shedding a bright light on the subject. I could go on about how not one of the characters is developed enough to overcome the films main flaw of not being LIKE A DREAM or how Nolan couldn't seem to make up his mind which movie to make; the more psychologically gripping tale of multiple lives lived in an endless cascade of dreams or the non-stop, high octane espionage tale which would have been super fun if it had actually taken place IN A DREAM (but keepin' it real, the action sequences we did see were pretty standard). I won't, however, because I can't let go of the glaring inadequacies of Mr. Nolan's literal, linear, unimaginative, and perhaps disinterested efforts to delve into the dream world proper.While walking out of the theater, I got into a quick chat with another member of the audience. I stated that, :in the main the film was predictable"" and he replied, ""I think it was supposed to be"". Really, since when are dreams predictable? Mein Gott! We're getting soft. People, we're not supposed to walk out of a movie concerned with this both known and unknowable subject matter rock-steady. On the contrary, we should all be wearing deeply puzzled yet deeply satisfied looks on our faces as though we'd been led across some great gulf and left there to work our own way back. The takeaway message here is that it takes more than the latest CGI to deliver a reasonable simulacrum of the sub-conscience. And for the proof of that remark one need only look at the work of Michel Gondry and of the master, David Lynch. Your mind will reel indefinitely."
119099,True,"Inception is one of the more enjoyable films that I have seen in some time. It falls somewhere between the Matrix (methodology), Vanilla Sky (multi-layered realities) and the Usual Suspects (densely-plotted, begs more than one viewing.)The result is a thrill-ride that will leave most viewers pondering long after the credits have rolled. It is both provocative and at times mesmerizing, albeit a bit over-thought at times.Though the idea of ""dream hacking"" is hardly new, Nolan's layers to the idea make the concept seem quite fresh and the result is something unique. Instead of relying on one ""plane"" of consciousness or dreamscape, Nolan has included ""levels"", which dictate different levels of a dream and each team member has a role to serve in navigating its murky and at times unnerving landscape to accomplish their mission. Timing is critical at every level and the story is weaved together rather well, though at times it can feel a little overwhelming.In fact, the only complaint I have about the film is that at certain moments it bogs down under the weight of its own complexity and at times, unnecessarily.Part of this is because Nolan is a little unconventional in terms of how he handles exposition. Instead of laying out the rules of the world in one part of the film, he chooses to add more rules as the film progresses.In a more conventional scenario, consider the Matrix:1. First part, we are as disoriented as Neo and do not understand what is happening. 2. Second part, the rules of the world are laid out by Morpheus and suddenly we understand what is happening. 3. Finally, the action takes place with the audience in the full know of the established rules.With Inception, these rules unfold throughout almost the entire film, much like the plot points. The result is a double-edged sword: On one hand, it keeps the film moving swiftly and you continue to have ""ah-ha"" moments. On the other hand, it makes one feel like scorekeeping is in order to keep everything straight as you watch it.It's not so much that Nolan gives us TOO MUCH INFORMATION, as much as it that he gives us CRITICAL PIECES OF INFORMATION in VERY SMALL WINDOWS of screen time. This means one ill-timed bathroom break could compromise your entire understanding of the film. Even paying strict attention the entire time, there are still times when details lost because we're too busy absorbing info. Another common complaint is the ""ambiguous ending"", which has sparked raging debates. I personally don't mind such endings. I like coming to my own conclusions, but that's just me. Unfortunately though, I found more ambiguous moments throughout the entire film, which doesn't work as well. Again, the ""rules"" get fuzzy at times, which one should always be avoided when doing science fiction, especially as layered as this.That being said, you still feel like you've seen a ""complete film"" at the end, and it should resonate one way or another, good or bad. No one and I mean NO ONE can dispute Nolan's ambition here. It's one of the most ambitious concepts and films I've seen in years.PERFORMANCESI don't consider myself a huge DiCaprio fan. I love much of his early work but don't remember him in a memorable role since Titanic (I have not yet seen Shudder Island, which I am told he is good in.) I thought he was very strong here, with much of Nolan's script playing to his strengths.Supporting performances were exactly what I expected -- nothing Oscar worthy, but perfectly capable. Cillian Murphy is teamed up with Nolan again, and serves his character well. I feared Ellen Page would be a weak link in the film, but I was wrong. Also refreshing were the performances of lesser known talents such as Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe and Dileep Rao. Michael Caine also has a small part and it's always good to see him.My biggest disappointment was Marion Cotillard, who I thought was rather one-dimensional here. But that may have been more of a symptom of her role. CINEMATOGRAPHYIn standard Nolan fashion, Inception is generally gorgeous and well- shot. I love the fact that Nolan relies less on CGI than the average Hollywood director and still understands the value of organic action, scenes and stunts.MUSICFrankly, I was under whelmed with the score, but less because of the score itself and more so because it seems too loud and overwhelming at times. There were even times when I couldn't even hear dialogue. This is either a mixing/editing problem OR possibly because I was sitting at the back of my theater and it seemed too loud.IN CONCLUSIONI found Inception to be exciting and captivating, and easily one of the better films of 2010. Where does it rank among the all time greats? I cannot say. I do consider it a top-flight science fiction film, but I struggle to think of it as a cinematic masterpiece because I really do think it out-thought itself on too many occasions.Do I suggest you go see it? Absolutely, no questions asked. In parting I'll leave you with....RECOMMENDATION FOR FIRST TIME VIEWERS:1. The first 10-15 minutes are a little disorienting. Be patient, things will fall into place soon enough.2. As mentioned above, try and avoid bathroom breaks. It really can be the difference.3. Sit in the middle or front of the theater. As mentioned above, either by design or because of my theater, the music was too loud at times and dialogue was lost.4. Be prepared to be absorbing a lot of input. You won't have much time to process that input until the film is over."
119100,True,"Christopher Nolan's one of the best directors working today. So my expectations were understandably high for his latest, Inception. Even with hefty expectations, I was still blown away. I'll need to see it one or two more times to unravel all of the plot intricacies, but I honestly believe that this is Nolan's best film to date. Yes, I think that Inception's better than The Dark Knight and Memento. I adore The Dark Knight and Memento, so this isn't just high praise, it's astronomical.Here's a brief plot summary. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a corporate espionage agent with a very specific area of expertise; stealing people's ideas through their dreams. Dom and his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are hired by their previous target Saito (Ken Watanabe) to perform an even more difficult task; inception, the planting of an idea in someone's subconscious to the point where they believe it to be their own. Dom assembles his team; researcher Arthur, architect Ariadne (Ellen Page), forger Eames (Tom Hardy), chemist Yusef (Dileep Rao) and Saito himself, who is tagging along to protect his investment. However, Dom's subconscious could threaten the entire team, especially with the memory of his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) being a less-than-helpful saboteur. Suffice to say that, when the mission finally gets under way, not everything goes according to plan Films as rich, multi-layered and compelling as Inception rarely come along. This film is full of intelligent ideas and questions about illusions and reality (much like the hugely under-appreciated Shutter Island from earlier this year, which also starred DiCaprio). However, it is also a riveting action thriller, with thrilling, jaw-dropping action sequences and unforgettable images. Think you've seen all the visual effects? Wait until you witness the iconic moment in which Ariadne bends the Paris cityscape on top of itself. Think you're seen all the action sequences? Wait until you devour the extraordinary zero-gravity fight in a hotel corridor between Arthur and an armed goon. This is majestic entertainment.The tortured love story at its centre gives Inception much-needed heart. This is largely due to the exceptional performances of DiCaprio and Cotillard. DiCaprio is effortless here; this is all the more impressive, as the whole film rests on his shoulders. If he goes down, so does the film. DiCaprio never exaggerates his portrayal of a man who is carrying deep emotional scars, instead hinting at his pain through his expressions and body language. In a early sequence, whilst Cobb is describing the business of mind defence to Saito, he holds his arms and hands out like a box in front of him. This not only shows the prison of the mind which Dom must break into, but also symbolises his own emotional entrapment. It is this kind of subtle behaviour which defines DiCaprio's performance. It is also notable that he doesn't try to overshadow his co-stars. This is another superlative piece of work from DiCaprio, following his haunting performance in Shutter Island. Cotillard, on the other hand, is the tragic heart of Inception. Beautiful and menacing at the same time, Cotillard is gracefully strong in her role. She is a truly alluring presence, and together she and DiCaprio bring an electrifying pulse of humanity to Inception.Gordon-Levitt's brilliant; he brings great authority to his role and constantly gained my attention. Also, he's rewarded with the zero-gravity fight sequence. Hardy is charming and bad-ass; his bickering with Gordon-Levitt is one of the film's highlights. Page brings intelligence and wit to her role; at one point, she wonders out loud, ""whose subconscious are we in, exactly?"" Ariadne is the audience, constantly wondering whether we are in reality or the dream world. Watanabe is quietly dignified and cunning; we often wonder whether to trust Saito, and Watanabe seizes that ambiguity. Cillian Murphy brings a hitherto unseen emotional depth to his performance here as the target of the team, whilst Rao also impresses. Even Michael Caine and Tom Berenger appear in minor but pivotal roles, and both do great work, with Berenger in particular succeeding in a tricky role.Technically, this is one of the most extraordinary films I have ever experienced. Hans Zimmer's mind-blowing musical score and the wonderfully free, wide cinematography by Wally Pfister both give the film an epic scope which compliments the potential of dreams to transport us to a world beyond mundane reality. And what else can be said about the visual effects? They are mind-bogglingly beautiful to behold. Also, a big shout out to editor Lee Smith. Especially in the last hour, where events in the different layers of the dream world are simultaneously playing out on screen, Smith's editing gives the film perfect fluidity and immediacy. This film runs for around two and a half hours, and it moves like a bullet all the way to the conclusion.Inception's a visionary, muscular and mesmerising work of genius, with excellent performances, gorgeous imagery, heart-pounding action, a terrific screenplay from Nolan and his brother Jonathan, a stunning score and intelligent discussions about the human mind and the pain that it sometimes struggles to abandon. The final shot's pitch-perfect, questioning the fine line between what is perceived by the mind as reality and what is truly the real world, without going for the easy twist that one might expect. Mr. Nolan is far too clever for that, and he is too respectful of his audience and their intelligence. His craftsmanship and imagination in a world filled with generic, seen-it-all-before films isn't only commendable; it is awe-inspiring. Inception is easily the best film of the year so far, and it will be hard to top. It deserves multiple Oscar nominations in both the technical categories and the big ones such as Best Picture and Best Director. If this film isn't on my top ten list of the decade come 2020, this decade is going to have to have been one incredible period of creativity, ambition and sheer ingenuity at the cinema."
119101,True,"An interesting way to portray futuristic lucid dreaming technology.The movie would have been more enjoyable if it focuses more on the dialogs than the blockbuster action. We've seen the effects before, so there's really nothing much new as compared to the Matrix when slow bullets first came in.Since the idea of lucid dreaming is still new and fresh to most people, not many people would actually understand the depth of this movie.And what i didn't understand was, why couldn't the dreamer dream of better weapons? OR wear a bulletproof vest etc.? If the dreamer could dream of such complicated architecture, wouldn't that also mean he/she could dream of the people in it? Since in dreams, buildings and humans are the same, they are emotionless and formless. Only the dreamer feels it and have the power to tailor it.Everyone would love the idea of living a life in a dream to wake up still young. And i believe that this is true! It's a matter of how much you can remember from the dream after awoken. It's said that 90% of dreams are lost within 5 mins after awoke.Limbo just did not make sense in the movie. How one arrive and get out, is a little complex. And really, one could wake up with the memory lost from a dream? The movie is not exactly mind blowing since we have already seen similar pieces of work but it's still good and refreshing once in a while rather than those no brain teaser movie, iron man etc.I guess the most intriguing is Nolan's conclusion of the movie is that we will never find out if Cobb is dreaming and neither will he. Still, thumbs up and worth watching.Other better similar movies to recommend: Vanilla Sky, Waking life, The Matrix."
119102,True,"Christopher Nolan has the penchant of playing mind games in his previous three movies: Memento (2000) , Insomnia (2002) and The Prestige (2006). Inception is Nolan's fourth production which brings mind games in the next higher level.The story of Inception is rather original, touching on areas which many have not explore before. It is further enhanced with a group of A-listed cast, including Leonard DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy and Michael Caine. With Joseph Gordon-Levitt (of (500) Days of Summer) and TV actor Tom Hardy as the leading cast, Inception is a sci-fi thriller which is presented without much confusion due to the various characters involved in the story.Dom Cobb (DiCaprio) is a master thief who specializes in stealing ideas from the victim's dream, when the victim is in a sub-conscious state. After the plan of stealing an idea from Japanese businessman Saito (Watanabe) fails, he was given one last chance to redeem himself: not to steal, but to implant an idea on Saito's rival, Robert Fischer Jr (Murphy). With the help of his group of specialist (Gordon-Levitt, Hardy) and the recruitment of a student Ariadne (Page), the team began their heist on the implant of ideas, which comes with enemies they had never seen, or prepared for it.Inception is not your usual boring summer blockbuster flick which throws in loads of cliché plots and predictable endings. The concept may seen very similar, just like any other movie focusing on a heist. However, the catch is Nolan creates the story, using the background that not many filmmakers will touch on: dreams and state of consciousness. The Matrix Trilogy (2000 - 2003) had cover on dreams and consciousness, and no other movies has touched on similar issues. Now, these areas are once again, being explored and brought to a new level.Nolan awes the audience by creating state of sub-consciousness in layers, which means a dream within a dream. Ideas in real life becomes the setting and background for a person in their dream, where what has happened in real life will determine what will happen in the dream. An example created by Nolan in this case: a person will be flooded in their dream when he/she was woken up by water in real life. This seems magical, and at the same time, logical. Thus, to enhance the thrill the audience are experiencing, Nolan creates a new level of sub-conscious state the team will be experiencing by what is happening to them, which in someway, looks like a chain reaction in different sub-conscious levels.DiCaprio's role of Cobb is the center of the story, where his decision will affect the people around him, together with the outcome of the heist. While he is creating the most perfect crime to salvage himself, he will need to overcome the grief of the death of his wife, Mal (Cotillard), which can be his potential enemy. By implanting the role of Mal in the world of Cobb, we can see how Cobb is crippled by the thoughts of Mal, while trying to create the perfect heist.Both issues discussed above creates the labyrinth within the movie itself, where audience are brought to a labyrinth, and they have to figure out on ways of getting themselves out. While the labyrinth is created in the movie for the team to avoid and deter the attack of unknown enemies, the audience is brought to the labyrinth, where they need to figure out what happens next. Certain form of interaction between the team and the audience exists in Inception.Though the audience might not get much action sequence in Inception compared to Nolan's previous acclaimed production, The Dark Knight (2008), an interaction has been created for the audience, which is something that is very much lacking in the movies we are watching in cinemas today.If the summer blockbusters playing out there fails you, go for Inception. You will have fun and you will never regret, for there is always something new for you, waiting to be explored."
119103,True,"Honestly coming into Inception I didn't have a clue what it was about, but I knew it had to be good with Christopher Nolan directing and Leonardo DiCaprio starring (funnily enough I didn't care for him until I watched Shutter Island). Despite my assumption being based almost entirely on names the film did not disappoint! Inception is the definition of summer movie and Nolan created an intelligent film with an actual plot behind the orgy of special effects fuelled explosions (which there was plenty of). The storyline is very matrix-esquire and Nolan manages to weave a story with dreams within dreams and the whole concept of implanting an idea seamlessly. Although aside from DiCaprio's character many had no real personality, but the performance is mostly on DiCaprio in the end and he manages to succeed in creating a character still lost in his dreams pining over his love. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you should definitely see it because its a wonderful blend of action adventure, science fiction themes, plot (!), and explosions."
119104,True,"I loved ""Memento""...I liked ""The Dark Knight"" and I couldn't believe that Heath Ledger could out-do Jack...I truly like every actor in ""Inception""...I am a faithful IMDb user for many years....having said all those good things, WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH YOU VOTERS?....More than 100,000 of you voted this movie a ""10""?? You're gonna tell me that this movie is the 4th best movie of all-time?...I don't know if there's another movie website out there but I'm gonna start looking....what a joke...I don't understand what's going on with the IMDb voters lately, but if you think that Inception, The Dark Knight, City of God, The Matrix, and The Professional deserve to be in the top 35 movies of all time, it's time for me to look for another movie website...Not a single one of those movies is worth a second view (with the possible exception of the Dark Knight if only to watch Ledger), and not one of those movies will be relevant in 5 years (with the possible exception of The Matrix for its' special effects)...For a movie to be rated in the Top 250 of all-time you have to think ahead...will anyone CARE about it in 10 years time??...Who's gonna care about this movie in 2 years time? I thought Shutter Island was pretty stupid but Shutter Island is The Godfather of all movies compared to this mess of a movie...Oh, I'm wrong, It's not a dream...It's a dream within a dream...or is it a dream within a dream within a dream?"
119105,True,"After all the hype and marketing that built up before the release of this film I decided to leave it a week before seeing it. Sitting in a crowded cinema with hundreds of wannabe intellectuals who will immediately, and loudly, begin to dissect the film as soon as the credits roll doesn't appeal to me.I've heard that Inception is a ""mindf***"" and a film that requires more than one viewing to fully understand. Well, I never found it to be that way. Not that I am showing off, but I found it rather straight-forward in the sense that it goes from A-Z, but the entire alphabet in-between is completely jumbled and anyone the slightest bit attentive can put it in the right order rather easily.Is it well made and flawlessly shot? Definitely! I think that Wally Pfister is long overdue for an Oscar and his cinematography on this film should secure him that award. The acting, while competent, left me cold though. I never really felt anything for the characters, they were far too distant and deadly serious. It reminded me of the Matrix (a very similar film) with the heavy exposition and surreal physics. Inception is all about spectacle and epic visuals. That's not a real criticism though. The scope and sights are worth the price of a ticket alone.The dream manipulation theme has been around for decades and it didn't impress me as anything breathtakingly new. Hans Zimmer borrows from his own Dark Knight score a bit too liberally, though there are some ingenious sounds in there. So...while many, many people are praising this film to the point of possible mass-hysteria I have to point out that there isn't THAT much original about it.A bold, confident work, and consistently gripping, but no one will blame you if you have a feeling of deja vu. Even the final shot is similar to the ending of a certain Paul Verhoeven film from 1990. Is it a dream or is it reality? It's been done before.If you want a film that truly messes with your head check-out David Lynch's Inland Empire or Lost Highway."
119106,True,"Let me just say that first and foremost I am a Christopher Nolan fan. I watched The Following and Memento over and over again. In his new movie, Inception he has a love story with no love. This is the biggest piece missing in the puzzle. The trailer convinced the moviegoer that this movie was about a guy who goes into people's dreams and steal secrets. That is not what this movie is about. In fact, there are giant holes in the set-up. He did a few cardinal sins as a writer, for example, he set up rules for his world and then broke them. The movie is interesting and ground-breaking with the action and effects but in the end you don't care about the characters. In the end, with all the dizzying effects and cut backs all you have is a Lost like ending. I hated Lost because ultimately they didn't know how it was going to end. And I think for Christopher Nolan he fell victim to this same fate."
119107,True,"Inception is one of the boring overrated films I have ever seen. Let's start with the plot of the movie. Basically they have to go into a dream world to convince a guy to do something. Why? Why don't they just kidnap him, threaten to kill him or someone he loves if he doesn't do it. Could have made a decent little flick. Nope, lets waste 3 hours falling in a van and wondering if we are in a dream world. Boring. I think this is the I love Nolan fans boys thinking he can do no wrong. I like Nolan, interstellar was a good film, so was batman begins and the dark knight (the other 1 was terrible) maybe it's me but I think this movie is very overrated, I gave it a 1 because its probably a 4 at best(not 8.8), the effects in the film are great but that doesn't make a good movie in my opinion"
119108,True,"Spoiler warning.This film is just overrated beyond belief. The genius in this movie, is that it makes viewers feel like they are a genius, feeling they understand what is going on and that they are very smart for it because the story is so complex. Yes it is complex, but it is totally incoherent and illogical and the complexity is not contributing but quite the opposite. The complexity is uncalled for and unnecessary. The people following and attacking the protagonists are all heavily armed and professional armed forces. Yet their aim skills seem to be non-existent. Heavy machine guns, explosives, sniper-rifles and the only on who got shot was Mr. Ciao or whatever his name was (the characters were so non engaging, I can't even remember their names after just finishing watching the movie). Also the music is just horrendous and totally over the top.The only thing I got from this movie was a headache. Totally wasted these 2.5 hours on nothing but more Hollywood American blockbuster filth."
119109,True,"I figured out this was all a dream because there were zero black people in the movie. The one minority in the movie is of course a drug dealer. Well played.*Spoiler* belowThe plot is wasted. The rich use idea extraction and inception contractors to change the future. In this particular case, to prevent a monopoly but there's no emotional connection or drama created. What will happen if they do not succeeded other than ""our employer will not accept failure"" ? Long movie and no real explanation. Try again. And this time ""take your time"". In the movie, while dreaming, 5 mins feels like an hour. Well, somebody wake these guys up and tell them they're talking too long to sound smart. I feel like this whole movie is in limbo waiting for someone to wake it up. The one good thing about Inception is the visuals. The scenes are beautiful. Whatever style of filming this is, it carried the movie throughout. Hopefully they make a sequel and create a back story. Otherwise, this movie is really stupid and the people who give it such a high rating can't explain the many holes in the story line."
119110,True,"I love this film one of my favourites. The dynamics and computerised affects are just mind blowing. I can definitely relate to the dream world...those sort of dreams can become nightmares...not so great if your being chased by people with guns or ghosts. Leonardo DiCaprio is such a talented actor, its like he becomes the character. I love the edited effects of this film where they've slowed it down...it gives me goosebumps. Always will be in my top 10 list of best films. I felt like i was in the film; i actually got quite emotional and violent at the cinema because of Marions character...shes so irritating and delusional (certainly a femme fatal). I like that the producers challenged the audience with their cliff hanger. Is he dreaming or his awake...i wonder. I really hope there's an Inception 2."
119111,True,"To be as honest as possible with my review I did watch Inception a second time after reading all the FAQ, fans reviews etc to make sure I understood the film well enough. The second viewing just confirmed my first impressions: the film is enjoyable but it's so full of flaws, it's surprising to see it so highly praised, especially here on IMDb.One thing right away that disappoint me is that the film keeps you guessing and wondering where it all will go but in the end it's under delivering on its promises. And you're left with a sentiment of having been manipulated for no reason. In Inception you're promised a blend of action, drama and even philosophy that never really lift off above their premises. Take for example the concept of ""Inception"", we're told at the beginning it's ""the most radical idea"" but in the end, it feels like a sales pitch because we don't feel anything special about it. Just because you say it's radical doesn't make it radical.Now let's talk about the obvious flaws: 1. No character development, especially around Cobb they're all feeling cardboard. I don't think all films need character development but in a film that has some pretension at drama, it's a glaring flaw. Cobb is a bit developed through his relationship with Mel but it's never convincing or deep enough. BTW I think Di Caprio is mis-casted (again after Shutter Island) in a role of a grown-up man.2. Plot holes everywhere. It's particularly glaring after a second viewing where you're left wondering why some of the characters do this or that. It's not like the first viewing where you were thinking it would be solved by further revelations. There is also some inconsistencies about how the dream world is supposed to work in this film. Sometimes it works this way, sometimes, to fit the story, it doesn't! 3. Weak motivations. OK some of them maybe just a MacGuffin but seriously I wish they would have find something more credible for their main job. And less morally flawed. That's another thing that speak volumes of our times: characters do morally questionable actions but they never seem to be aware of it. They just do what they want without thinking about it. Or there is always a ""good"" justification.4. At the end, it doesn't really make you think. I know, it's an action flick. Or is it? It seems that many people gloss over the ""many layers"", the ""complexity"", etc. The director/writer also seems to have some pretension. But it's not even first grade philosophy, it's quite trite actually. And not complex at all, the characters are always exposing (often in a dull babbling way) what you need to know to understand the story.In spite of these flaws there are also some redeeming features. Technically it's well made, but we know Hollywood is invincible about that, especially with such a budget. The director does a good job of keeping you seated through a narrative that always make you guessing what this is all about. But at the end you feel a bit manipulated because the carrot has no taste. There's good suspense and mystery. But next time they should hire a real writer. That's a thing that amaze me about some big budget flicks, they spend millions on CGI and almost nothing (so it seems by the result) on a good script. Like a car with a super powerful engine but no tires."
119112,True,"Like ""Memento"" completely overrated plot wise: like it's brilliant and stuff and all kinds of explanations and dimensions outlined by the fans. It's just about a man who's torn up by the suicide of his wife, searching his own mind for his responsibility in all this to find forgiveness and carry on with his live. The whole movie until the part where he wakes up in the plane is just a reflection of his chaotic and desperate mind dealing with the loss of his wife. And all the dream-layers and stuff is complete and utter nonsense to make a cool and fun movie. Just a lesser serious ""Shutter Island"".""The Prestige"" is still Christopher Nolan's best work according to me, doesn't mean Inception wasn't a good movie, but certainly not in the top 10 of all time best movies.Wake up people.Oké raised the score from 7 to 8, just seen it again, still think the whole dream-sharing-creating idea is full of crap, nothing genius here... but cool and fun as stated before."
119113,True,"Christopher Nolan, the director of such memorable pictures as ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Memento,"" among others, has taken visual imagery and special effects to a new high, adding a fairly intriguing plot to the mix with his newest effort, ""Inception."" And while the film tends to employ a bit too many shoot- 'em-up scenes, gets a little convoluted and drags near the end, it is nevertheless one of the better products of 2010.It was a story that has been in Nolan's dreams for at least 10 years, now, in its fruition, it's living up to most of its hype - so far.Basically, it's ""Dreamscape"" meets ""The Matrix"" meets ""Mission: Impossible"" meets ""Shutter Island,"" but with enough originality to set itself apart from these movies and features a cast that includes Oscar winners Marion Cotillard (""La vie en Rose"") and Michael Caine (""Hannah and Her Sisters,"" ""The Cider House Rules""), along with nominees Leonardo DiCaprio (""The Aviator,"" ""Blood Diamond""), Emma Page (""Juno""), Tom Berenger (""Platoon""), Pete Postlethwaite (""In the Name of the Father"") and Ken Wantanabe (""The Last Samurai"").Story has Cobb (DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, ""500 Days of Summer,"" ""Third Rock From the Sun"" TV series) as extractors- or corporate dream thieves, if you will - who rip off ideas and concepts for a huge company that profits from the acts. But when the two attempt to extract secrets from industrial giant Saito (Wanatabe), they are met with mixed results.Having failed their mission, the two are now on the run from company goons, but Saito offers to clear things up if they use their skills to plant an idea into the mind of a corporate rival, Robert Fischer, Jr. (Cillian Murphy, ""Breakfast On Pluto,"" ""Redeye""). Evidently, planting an idea is much more complicated than stealing one, so Cobb has to assemble a team to do the job.Add dream-builder Ariadne (Page), driver Yusuf (Dileep Rao, ""Avatar"") and forger Eames (Tom Hardy, ""Thick As Thieves,"" ""Oliver Twist"") to the mix and soon the group has sedated Fischer aboard a 757 and is traveling through his subconscious. They must, however, travel through several layers of his psyche and induce a dream-within-a-dream-within-a dream to properly plant the seed.Meanwhile, Cobb is fighting his own demons based on memories of his late wife, Mal (Cotillard). It's a relationship where the two created their own virtual world but it all came crashing down when they lost touch with reality. Or did they?That's the question (or problem) that left some viewers scratching their heads after seeing this film. The script is highly imaginative and compelling, but the movie does tend to overlap itself with cleverness until is almost becomes too intellectual for its own good.That, and the subplot involving Cobb's little children is uninteresting and unnecessary.Aside from that, this was well done on so many levels that the long running time and sequences at the snow fort - while annoying at times- did not detract for the overall enjoyment of the experience.Perhaps released a bit too early for much Academy Award recognition in the acting department (although DiCapio and Cotillard stand out), expect big things for the visual effects and maybe the cinematography. We'll see.For now, just soak in one of the more innovative and imaginative works you are likely to see for a while."
119114,False,"Let's get this out of the way right now: This movie does NOT make you think. I am so sick of that cliché. A movie may be challenging to the senses and demand your undivided attention, but it can't make you think. You think independently of movies, people. Stop giving Hollywood that much credit.That said, I found Inception to be a grand disappointment. One of the things that marks other Chris Nolan projects is his love of character and development of such. Nolan has interesting ideas, but once he gets the germ of an idea, he then populates his films with rich and interesting people, giving them compelling stories, making us care about what happens to them beyond the constructs of the idea. Not just masterpieces like Memento, The Prestige, and Insomnia (one of the few English language remakes of a foreign film to get it right), but even in his ""comic book"" movies, Batman Begins and THe Dark Knight, Nolan's love of character and relationships is what drew us into the story.Insomnia is about 2-dimensional characters (okay, some of them flirt with being 2.5-dimensional) who wander through a complex and admittedly brilliant idea for a little over two hours. There are some stunning visuals and some quirky twists, but for the most part I fought to stay awake because I did not care. I was told not to leave to go to the bathroom or I would be lost when I came back; well, I nodded off for 15 minutes and did not miss a beat.And for all this primal hooting about the breathtaking final shot, a moment that elicited gasps from audiences across America ... not to sound arrogant, but I must be smarter than most audiences because I saw that moment coming. I knew how the film would end, and I knew what that last image would be.An okay film, but not up to Nolan's standards."
119115,False,"Not too sure what all the fuss is about Nolan has directed far better movies.How this can be rated in the top 10 of the 'Top 250' index only demonstrates the flaws of the IMDb rating system as much as it does to the rationale behind general movie-goers.The idea of a dream within a dream, or lucid dreams, or memories, has been touched on and seen in other films. Vanilla Sky is a perfect example, which is actually a much better film overall. The acting is more powerful and you begin to develop a strong connection with the characters throughout the movie, unlike in Inception which is rather more focused on plot.Inception...well, I wish it really were a dream."
119116,False,"When I first saw the early 2009 trailer of this movie I was intrigued because I knew this time Nolan will not repeat himself in a brilliant breathtaking action movies like he made before in his new Batman or the deep thriller he represented in ""The Prestige"" or the mind-blowing ""Memento""No, This time Nolan will make his crown jewelry his own masterpiece.This time Nolan will teach us how to make a thriller-action-psycho-mind blowing with intelligent science tricks movie .And when I saw ""INCEPTION"" yesterday I wasn't disappointed. In the first few minutes you will be bolted in your chair trying to get the grasp of what is going on around you. I can only describe it as the same reaction when you first saw ""The Matrix"". There is certain rules going on you can't understand, which will begin to reveal its meanings after a while.Cobb ""Dicaprio"" is a strange character-reminds you of ""Teddy Daniels"" at his last "" Shutter Island""-his job is stealing the ideas from the industries' pioneers by tricking them in their dream state to reveal their secrets.This is the main character the film is all about, around him a clever cast of Joseph Gordon- Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken watanabe, Dileep Rao and Michael caine to support him in his new ""mission impossible-like"" job.The job is instead of stealing an idea is to put a new one in the mind of a rich industry heir ""Cillian Murphy"" by putting him in a deep three level dream in order to reach to the core of his mind to plant this idea.During the film you will discover the danger they put themselves into by doing so, and that Cobb ""Dicaprio"" is hiding a secrets of his own. Also a several shift between different dreams happening in the same time away from what is happening in reality with a time perspective change which was a surreal experience. A twist of brilliant camera,visual,action & science tricks is the main theme of this movie, you can't trust any of your senses, you can't make the difference between dreams and reality, you are caught up in-between all the time. I can't describe it really only by that you don't know if you took the blue pill or the red one as like in ""The Matrix"", and maybe it is much worse because during the movie you won't know whether you are dreaming or watching a movie in a cinema - or maybe its just me - :)The final words that Nolan has answered the question of why the cinema won't die, by showing us that there is still a huge creative space waiting to be discovered."
119117,False,"I haven't done a 'movie review' in a while, basically because we've had quite a lot of rubbish recently. Well, either rubbish, or clichés. Gone are the day's of the 90's, with great movies that were actually intelligent, like Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, Sixth Sense, and so on. Now all we seem to get is more of the same dumbed down movies, over and over again, and so on for the past decade (sure, there have been a few good movies here and there, but that's all they are, a 'few').This year seems to have made a comeback, though; is this decade going to be a good one for movies? Shutter's Island at the beginning of the year with it's crazy multiple psychological twist, trailers for Salt showing a clever WTF plot line, and just yesterday, Inception.Wow. It's not often I sit and watch a movie in the cinema gripping the edge of my seat, dreadfully anticipating the next few seconds. Not often that a movie ends and everyone in the cinema starts clapping.So what is this Inception business? Well, to actually review the movie without spoilers is kinda tough, and even though it's kind of immune to spoilers (telling you the ending would not take away from the story, as it's the point of 'how they got there', and even if I tell you 'how they got there' it would probably make you more confused) so if you haven't watched it yet, read until the ---Spoilers--- tag below. The movie has a cast that basically drove it to perfection; Michael Caine, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Marion Cotillard, and stars the lovely Leonardo DiCaprio, who got famous from the cheesy ""I'm the King of the World"" scene in Titanic (well, that and getting it on with Kate Winslet in the back of a steamy car). Let's just say back then he was a little, what's the word, soft.But over the years, he's gone from some young and pansy romantic actor into my top 10 list (along with Al Pacino, De Niro, Brad Pitt, etc), and again that's partly through his mind blowing performances in movies that again, blow your mind; from Gangs of New York, to The Departed, to the recent Shutter's Island, and now this? I must say, we're far off from that little kid back in Titanic.Inception is basically about dreams, how you can actually enter someone's dreams (through a physical connection while you both sleep), and from there steal hidden ideas and thoughts from their subconscious. DiCaprio plays an expert thief at that game, and along the way is forced to take a pretty tough mission (details of which I can't discuss, see spoiler part below).The acting was high quality, graphics amazing without making it seem over-done, and the plot-line way above anything you've seen in theatres over the past few years. This being said, it's not a movie most people won't get, but if you are a dumb viewer who can't grasp more than your typical straightforward storyline, don't bother watching this. I counted at least 8 people leaving the cinema half way through the movie. Many others would probably want to watch this a second time due to the complexity and number of levels this movie hits.I've always had a fascination with dreams, and how the dream world works in comparison to the real world; dreams within dreams, the time aspect of it, controlling your own dreams, or even being aware that you're actually in a dream - I wrote about this a while back, read it here (http://www.ammaro.com/2007/08/dreams-reality.html) It does raise multiple questions about your life, dreams, what is real and what isn't. I would go as far as say that it brings about that same feeling you get when you first watched 'The Matrix'. Everything in the real world seems kind of blurry for a while. And this movie makes you think, oh yes it makes you think. I couldn't find much to fault with it, except that even though the whole thing lasts about two and a half hours, I felt a few parts were rushed, and probably needed a little more development, while others dragged on a little. Overall, this didn't deter much from the enjoyment, I give this a 9/10, a definite must watch and so far the best movie of the year! Continued with spoilers at http://www.ammaro.com/2010/07/inception-2010.html"
119118,False,"I don't normally write reviews but looking at the 'This is a true masterpiece' type of reviews I thought I would balance it out a bit.Inception is a good film, the special effects are simply stunning and the acting very good indeed.The plot however is quite weak, and gets a bit lost and muddled towards the end.Many people think that because the plot appears complicated you have to watch it very carefully or twice. Not true the plot is very simple, and I found the film easy to follow, in fact after the first 30 Min's, me and my mates could easily predict what would happen - and indeed it did happen.All in all a good film, its the best I have seen this year. However very predictable and not really that clever."
119119,False,"Inception is overall an enjoyable experience. The concepts and rules Nolan presents to us are, like the intriguing Morpheus / Neo relationship (in the superior The Matrix) delivered to us in large chunks of exposition that never get boring due to the interesting ideas being put forth. This film never bores.However for a film about dreams, the action and set-pieces (except for a fight in zero G) are surprisingly unimaginative. Chases are never more than run, shoot, run (unlike some set pieces in the Bourne movies for example) and scenes like the ski chases in the snow feel flat when they could have been exciting set pieces with a bit more thought. It seems to me, that even though I enjoy his films, Nolan's weakest link is his direction of action.I also thought there could have been more use of the surreal and of the bending of physics at some stages. Yes I know they need the subject to be tricked into believing that it is not a dream but at one point a subject is told that he is dreaming, giving Nolan a pass to screw things up a bit visually. Yet he only goes so far as to have a bar shake and drinks in glasses bend with gravity. He could have gone further in scenes like this that's just my opinion.Overall this is worth seeing. Nolan has not made a single bad movie and all his movies are worth seeing. Inception isn't one of his top three (That's The Prestige, The Dark Knight and Memento in my opinion) but he can stand proudly beside his resume with this addition."
119120,False,"Certainly Inception is by no means a terrible movie, but given its hype, Nolan's past record and the claims that this was an overtly cerebral blockbuster made this one that I was looking forward to quite considerably. The most disappointing aspect was that with its dream concept I was waiting for some genuinely interesting surreal imagery, what I got didn't look altogether unlike a stylised advertising campaign for the fashionista with added contorting architecture. Whose dreams actually look like that? Advertising executives possibly, or more than likely the new elite of Hollywood film directors. Still it's not all bad, I found the Hans Zimmers soundtrack to be great, adorning the film with a dense atmosphere. DiCaprio's performance as Cobb is excellent, his relationship the subconscious manifestation of his deceased wife, Mal ((Marion Cotillard) providing an exceptional metaphor for grief and the emotional core of the piece. Unfortunately this is stark contrast with the supporting cast whose bare bones back story and lack of depth make them no more than emotional zeitgeists,whose sole purpose seems at times to provide mouth pieces In which to explain the intricacies of subconscious espionage. And that would probably be my main qualm with Inception; the obvious self-love it has for the cleverness of its concept, this is an accusation that can be thrown at a few of Nolan's other films. Though the director himself has nodded to the likes of Jorge Luis Borges and the anime Paprika as inspiration, the main concept of the piece is still strong and quite original, unfortunately its necessity to explain said concept throughout the film becomes a little grating to say the least, surely while the concept is clever it doesn't go the such realms of ingenuity nor originality that it should exhibit such a flagrant self- love. And while some have been stumped as to the concept of a dream within a dream I have to confess more of outright ignorance to Ken Watanabe's at times impenetrable accent."
119121,False,"It went too big. Personally there was just something wrong with Nolan's interpretation of the whole dream thing. I got uber bored and i thought most of the stuff was too predictable. People were freaking out saying this was the best film ever and it was mind-blowing and all that jazz. i FELT THERE WERE TO MANY PLOT HOLES AND GOT SICK OF THE FILM ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH. It was truly not even remotely as good as it was made out to be. 1. It wasn't as good as it was supposed to be. 2. I didn't end up liking any of the characters that much. 3. Nolan's fan-boys get on my nerves. 4. I have a friend who obnoxiously is obsessed with Nolan, and that makes me biased. 5. I had higher expectations based on Nolan's previous films."
119122,False,"When I first heard of this movie I could not wait to see it. I heard nothing but good reviews and it had Leo dicaprio which im am a huge fan. It was directed by christoper nolan the man who brought us the dark knight (another one of my favorites) so I watched this with very high expectations and sadly they were not met.This movie is set in the near future where it is actullay possible to enter someones mind and memories through their dreams. So a dream thief (leonardo)is sent into a persons mind to achieve ""inception""Now everybody is going to hate me for this but I thought this movie was just silly. The way they explained it and the explanations they had for everything were convoluted and silly. Then it had about hour of story and then about a hour and a half of shooting guns. You would think a movie with this complicated of story line would describe the story in depth but no. It piles on the information one thing after another in a ridiculous manner. If you liked the matrix and are usually a fan of this kind of Sci-Fi thing then this movie is most likely for you. If you are like me and prefer a movie to have solid story development and you want it to make total sense please stay away from this. The only reason i gave it 6 was because it was high budget it had leo and also some pretty stunning moments."
119123,False,"Good news is I got to see it for free on an HBO free weekend and did not have to pay to see it.Bad news, I got to see the movie.I was really looking forward to this movie. The trailers were great and the concept was intriguing. The problem was the execution. Once again, chase scenes, fights, explosions, special effects etc took the place of good writing. What could have been a cerebral movie just turned out to be another action movie. I do not want to take anything away from the special effects, they were very good and some were outstanding. My problem was that maybe there was only 30 minutes of actual plot and dialog in the entire movie. After a while, you quit wondering if it is real or a dream and just start dreaming that the movie will end soon. There are really no good twists and turns in the movie and little that is so thought provoking that you want to talk about the movie afterwords.My advice would be to take the special effects budget and spend it on some great writers.As the old commercial asked ""Is it real or is it Memorex?"" Who cares?"
119124,False,"Apologies if i stand whilst i speak of the Great Nolan, the altar is full of knick-knacks, the floor is dusty.I am sure to feel different when i have viewed this spectacle for the third time. As it is i felt no emotional engagement, no desire, no trepidation given that all threats on view were 'contrived' to be dangerous and were not inherently forceful enough to ensure my adrenalin peaked at any point by natural causes.In short, aside from my vague emotional criticism of something 'confined' by intellectual scripting, the whole does not carry the impact of the individual moment. The sensation was of having watched a two hour twenty minute trailer for a film.Clever, hence the 4 out of 10 marks. Lacking any sense of humour, warmth or human flaw, the sheer contrivance makes me want to go back to watching Batman kicking people about the place.Full of sound & no Freudian slippage, signifying misconstrued Jungian.And i apologise for the pretensions, unlike this movie, sorry, film."
119125,False,"We have a phrase in the UK about 'too many eggs spoiling the pudding' and my view against the majority of reviewers, is that Nolan had committed the same sin with Inception. On the positive side, the story has an intriguing and largely original premise. The cast are all pretty much excellent  DiCaprio and Page and but Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy also and great to see Tom Berenger again. Also a brief cameo by Pete Postlethwaite who I heard only today has sadly passed away  a great actor who appeared in some really interesting movies. Inception clearly had a big budget  masses of CGI (maybe a little too much?). All the ingredients are there but I felt that the script was a layer or two overdone. The 'arctic' section for example was largely unnecessary and didn't add anything to the story, other than dubious justification for extended gun play and James Bond style explosions with people flying through the air. Make no mistake, the story is very clever and bold but the plot lacked tightness and tried to be too clever, to the extent that my attention wandered as did that of those with me (all 'serious' movie fans). I really felt that 30 minutes or so could have been shaved off the running time and that the momentum of the story would have greatly benefited as a result. I know that Inception has achieved cult status and that this review will be considered blasphemy by some but I really feel that this thriller could have been so much better with tighter editing and direction."
119126,False,"I rarely write reviews here because I think that in general there are a bunch of people out there doing a very good job and I am not sure I have something to add. So I was amazed when I started reading the reviews for ""Inception"". Comparing Nolan with Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock? C'mon! And a solid stream of 10/10s for a movie that is admittedly very innovative, but misses the mark in several key places? What? Then I changed the sorting to ""prolific reviewers"" and then I saw it. People who watch and review a lot of films have a much more nuanced and diverse set of views about this film, which is what you would expect for a movie that genuinely tried to do something different. Obviously the marketing budget for this film extended to a big effort to pervert the integrity of IMDb.And my view on the film? Acting - great! CGI and general cinematography - excellent. Soundscape - better than average. General ability of a thriller's storyline to create and build tension and then release it quickly at the end - tick! Where this movie failed for me is in the storyline. Nolan should have spent another ten years on this one, because it fails to work on many, many levels. For a start, I didn't recognise many of the real qualities of dreams in the dream sequences. Not convincing from that point of view. Second, there are holes in the plot line you could drive a truck through, and for this kind of film I expect the storyline to be very, very tight and stand up to multiple viewings.This film is a worthy offering in the line of ""Memento"" and ""Mulholland Drive"", but Nolan didn't quite pull this one off and it cannot be rated in the same class as those two movies.For heaven's sake don't let this review stop you from watching this film. 7/10 from me means that it is definitely worth paying real money to go and see, and it is one of the better movies of 2010, make no mistake about that. It's also a thriller that keeps you thinking throughout, and that is uncommon in a summer blockbuster."
119127,False,"there have been a huge number of comparisons between this film and the matrix, and if this is true, then i'm sorry to say this film won't be winning best picture or best director. true that film is good, and enjoyable, but the film can be disheartening at times, because you as an audience have to work to keep up with the movie. though i understood it, i felt cheated because i ended up explain what had just happened to my mother, who was left dazed and confused about what had just happened.the film, moved through fantastically, but the start was a bit of a giveaway, that this film will end on an annoying note. though i like what Christopher Nolan did, i was greatly disappointed that he took more time in telling the movie, than he did telling the actuals story, if you get what i mean. i can certainly see why people are quick to say this will win best picture (because the dark knight didn't) we mustn't think like that, if we are to say every physcological thriller had to win best picture because it's entertaining, then the Oscar has lost it's merit because it's supposed to celebrate films, not a specific person."
119128,False,"Inception is a fine film, but it cannot match up to the hype. I am not going to explain much of the film here because it will ruin a plot built on surprises. Leo Caprio plays 'Cobb', a man possessed of a desire to return to the US to see his children, but is currently barred from the USA. God knows why he can't just move his kids to live with him in an altogether nicer country, but seemingly he can't. His passport to his dream is to enter the dreams of others and steal ideas, using some unexplained technology. Think Existenz, and you'll be on the right track, however Existenz did this a lot better IMO. Now, the cast is very good and Nolan conjures strong performances from every one of them. The cinematography is world class and where effects are used, they are striking and superb. But there's little emotional engagement with the characters, even the always brilliant DiCaprio fails to make us care for him. Add to this a flaky set of rules about the universe they inhabit, and it starts to get a little shaky. One gets the distinct feeling that Nolan changes and bends his own film architecture to suit the plot, rather than allowing the plot to flourish inside the film. He falls short of writing himself into a corner but nonetheless, this constant bending of the rules of the film prevents us from achieving total suspension of disbelief. On more than one occasion I was sat there thinking, ""that's all well and good but this latest statement contradicts earlier statements about such and such..""I can't give anything away on the above, but you'll see it for yourself, I am sure of that. I'd like to watch the film again to clarify a few points but some rather rambling exposition early in the film puts me off a little. I am sure that'll change and this is certainly a film that'll reward repeat viewings. I thought that Shutter Island was a far more delicate and engaging treatment of similar subject matter, with a superb and decisive denouement, whereas Inception rests on a fair few clichés. Definitely superior to your typical Hollywood blockbuster but not the work of genius the Internet would have you believe it is."
119129,False,"in order not to spoil anything, I will not give away any details of the story itself.the performance of the cast is convincing as to be expected. the movie is definitely well shot and has the ingredients to please a broad audience: talented and popular actors, a fast pace, action, brilliant animation and most importantly a storyline interesting enough to capture the viewer's attention.there is one thing left to be desired: the main character, Cobb describes his work as a chance to create things that never existed. one would expect to see just that in the dreamworld being built by Cobbs and his team. unfortunately, the movie falls short right there.nevertheless a movie worth watching. but Nolan can do way better."
119130,False,"This is amazing.. to see how many people were stupified by this movie..Scenario? Original but hardly adequate.. Film direction? Very-very good, Chris did it again. Acting? OK, I guess. Music? AMAZING!! Hans Zimmer is THE man!Long story short, the movie was an (almost annoying) continuous attack of mind-boggling and illogical ideas that (I believe) caught many people by surprise.. C'mon people! IMDb score:9.1?? For THIS?? Didn't it bother you that A LOT of things were totally inconsistent, phony and 'had-to-be-done?' (like the flow of the move dictated the characters to make *these* choices, for no logical reason). SOooo unconvincing.. So sad to see so many people's mental defenses breach so easily... Next time I half-expect to see a nicely and aggressively directed popular soda drink ad, to get a 9 on IMDb..On the pluses, the movie *is* original, direction is awesome, the music is FANTASTIC. Acting was OK. If they'd work the movie-logic right (trust me if FAR from right), then this film would be a great one; sadly it isn't (contrary to what *many* people voted). Personally I enjoyed it, and I suggested it to my friends as well. Don't miss the opportunity to see that movie, just don't get carried away by all this hype!!Cheers."
119131,False,"Now I will start by saying that for all the many flaws and silly plot holes, which seem more glaring the more you think about them after viewing the film, I did enjoy the ride. It didn't really stick closely to it's own rules and some of the characters got lost in the shuffle - well, most of them, I suppose - but at least Nolan was trying to create something more than the same old flicks Hollywood churns out like the hot-buttered popcorn you can buy at every cinema. It's not terribly original and nor should anyone buy into the hype that it is, but that doesn't mean it is without merit.To dispel the myth that this is original, I have to say it draws fairly obvious comparisons to the following works, which isn't to say it lacks originality, more that it treads the same sort of path with a different flavour.* The Matrix (1999) - Anyone who doesn't see this must be blind; they seem to come from the same seam. It's one of the few similar films that can stand up next to it though. * Dark City (1998) - The buildings, the gravity. I can't say more than that. * Blade Runner (1982) - Chris loves this film. It's more in visual styles than story but it's there. And when I think of the title I can't help but think of the term ""incept date"". * Star Trek TNG - For the holodeck reference/style mostly. * Heat (1995) - The action scenes, despite the fantasy settings, seem remarkably tight and often quite realistic. * Synecdoche, New York (2008) - The more I think about it, the more similar it seems to this film, and the more this film seems similar to Dark City. Which is why I like them, I guess. * Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind (2004) - Love is a big theme and how the mind deals with it an even bigger one. It would spoil Leo's story arc to say more. * eXistenZ (1999) - Can't believe I nearly missed this one. In that film it is virtual reality, as with The Matrix, but there are still a lot of parallels. * Ocean's Eleven (2001) - The whole thing about it being a concerted team effort to pull of such an ambitious caper.There are a lot of tiers at work here, and it's probably going to be the case that it's good first time around, and perhaps more intelligible after another viewing or three. Of course, the folks who fund Nolan films are aware of this and are hoping to double their revenue streams, actually adding this observation to some of the marketing bumph in the hope of getting people to go and see it twice a la Fight Club which makes me more than a little cynical, but I can wait for the home release anyway and would recommend everyone else do the same. This looks like a fun one to learn, certainly something worth studying if you happen to have more than a passing interest in film-making and convoluted slight-of-hand storytelling, and you really need to be able to pause, rewind and freeze-frame advance certain sections in order to do that.It mines the seam of ""what is reality, really?"" a favourite topic of Andrew Niccols and Charlie Kaufman, too. Those are among my favourite types of works because they beg endless discussion and if handled correctly can be a great source of inspiration. As I have a soft spot for those kinds of plots I suppose I'm naturally more willing to grant a bit more leeway, because credit where it is due I did find myself mulling over my perceptions of reality and re-evaluating the value of lucid dreams. Most films leave no discernible traces in the minds of anyone which makes this at least above average.The special effects aren't overused and/or intrusive, merely adding to the story I feel. And the mixture of CGI with real photographed elements is deftly handled. There is the odd moment of ""oh, too much"" or ""not layer blended so well there"" but trust me, it's far superior to a lot of the junk that gets through and at times I actually think they were deliberately making it a little weird and obvious to show it's still not a real world.To tie this review up: as one of the seemingly few people who thought The Dark Knight was a hopeless mess with very little to enjoy outside of a fiery Heath Ledger performance it's a welcome return to the twisting story lines that are usually a Nolan trademark. Despite the length there is enough going on that it doesn't feel like a moment of filler is present. Also, I would like to briefly point out that this is the first film DiCaprio has starred in where I actually enjoyed his performance completely.This film is not his best but nor is it his worst. It is well worth a watch, no doubt about that, but it shouldn't be heralded as a masterpiece and as of the time of writing this review is far, far too high in the IMDb Top 250. I'll grant that it is better than most of the cookie-cutter remake product that Hollywood is very fond of dishing up as of the past decade or so, therefore it looks better by comparison, but it isn't quite coherent enough to be brilliant. Hopefully it will inspire other writer/director auteurs to come up with similar, perhaps more lucid works. As it is, Memento (2000) and The Prestige (2006) are still the high watermarks against which few others can measure up, even the man himself. But it's still one hell of a ride."
119132,False,"With the good score and knowing Nolans previous work I got into the movie with some expectation. But the whole thing for me was, wait, the fun (visual or intellectual) will begin now, but no, it didn't begin then, seemed that some more explanation was needed, so be patient, the fun will begin soon, that movie looks long.... now?, will it begin now?... and the movie ended.I was thinking to see it again, perhaps I was not my most brilliant intellectual day but fortunately I see others experienced something similar so it was not my fault I think.So, an average+ work but with that hype and the director's prestige it doesn't live to the expectations."
119133,False,"The trailers of this movie were great, especially the second one (look for it on youtube). Great, dark score, mysterious story, superb special effects, and two great actors.The problem with the movie is, the trailer lasts little longer than 2 minutes, the movie lasts over two hours, and the time is wasted -- there is no mystery here. All good parts are in trailer already, the movie adds only ""surprising"" twists, but they are not surprising, they are just like deus ex machina alterations. The characters could even speak foreign language, it wouldn't matter because there is no cause-effect chain here, most events are incoherent.The movie repeats itself (how this can be interesting?), the moral struggles of the characters are rather shallow and predictable, and with constant shifts (now let's try something completely different) it is so unreal (not in sci-fi sense) that I didn't even care. Sure, unreality works for Terry Gilliam because he uses tale scheme, it worked for The Matrix because it was futuristic message with ancient background, it worked for Monty Python because it was comedy. But here? What it is? Monty Python seriously?Speaking of The Matrix, it was 11 years ago, when my mind was simply blown away. Inception didn't even manage to get me interested. You want a fast paced action thriller, watch The Kingdom (2007), want a masterpiece of suspense you cannot wait for solution, see The Ghost Writer (2010), you want an insight of the mind, see The Matrix, again (1999).Inception just will make you yawn. It is not even the execution, there was not any good idea for a full feature movie in the first place. The Matrix succeeded because it explained the whole mechanism and all pieces of the puzzle fit. Trailer of the Inception explains the mechanism well enough, there is nothing left to explain in the movie (and additionally, because of the nature of those two movies, there had to be a lot of similarities, and there are).I rate it so high (4/10) because I like main actors (yes, Ellen Page is cute). Every movie rating is a matter of taste but anyway I am totally surprised Inception is #3 at the charts, my advice -- look for something maybe not that fresh, but really solid, the one I mentioned above or Nothing but the Truth, or Syriana, or Body Lies, or The Departed, or (if you prefer something lighter, for summer), The Shooter, or... ;-D"
119134,False,"Interesting concept, and yet OK writing. Almost perfect casting, and yet rather odd acting. Visually stunning, and yet not very exciting. First of all, this movie is no Dark Knight, which is truly Nolan's best so far. It is also NOT The Matrix or Fight Club. The problem with the movie is it started out very interesting and grabbing audience attention right away, and yet with more and more detail being lay out, you started to realize it is not really that big a deal, In the theatre, as an audience sitting there watching people getting shot at and as the intensity steadily going up, the movie gives nothing, no fear, no pain, no emotion. Because all it is a dream. The worst possible outcome, you go insane, like we are not already. The movie lacks conflict which every good movie should have. Two, because the movie is set in dreams, so realistically, there shouldn't be too much emotions which Nolan got it right. Yet for a movie, it is a disaster, because without emotion there will be no feeling. Half way through the movie, I really didn't feel bad for Dom at all. His pain was like fantasies. It was all in his dreams. Even his personal family difficulty didn't strike me as painful. In today's global society, the situation he was in was just unbelievable. Last, the ending. It just doesn't make sense. To be honest, I can't even go into detail to explain why it doesn't make sense, but it just doesn't. A movie is still a movie. However, since Nolan can make a comic book movie actually make sense, and even nominated for Oscar. I will forgive him on this one. Either way, I recommend people to see it because it will make you think about it. Any movie that makes us use even the smallest amount of our brain is worthy of a viewing."
119135,False,"Inception, Christopher Nolan's seventh-feature film is in many ways a summation, of sorts of everything his cinema has strived to achieve for in the past decade or more. The detailed intricacies of human mind and the sheer complexity of all the layers that lie beneath it such themes have often played a frequent role in his movies. A magnum opus of epic proportions, Inception is the kind of a movie that is a sign of director reaching his artistic peak. It's like Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" or Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" in many ways where the meaning the director has been trying to strive for reaches it's complete realization. In the follow-up to the much-adored Dark Knight, Inception is a rare big-budget cerebral blockbuster built on strong foundations of it's original, mindbending concept in today's age of sequels and ""inspired"" remakes. Leonardo DiCaprio plays as Dom Cobb, an ""extractor"" who is paid to invade the dreams of the minds of various corporate giants and steal their ideas in a fictional setting of the future. When he is challenged by Saito (Ken Watanabe; understated for most parts) to attempt an inception which is the planting an idea into someone's mind, he accepts the challenge. Backed by a powerful ensemble cast including the likes of Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao and the ever- dependable Michael Caines, Inception drives forward often with the speed and intensity that can only be helmed by Nolan. Using mind-bending visuals and top-class special effects to create unforgettable dream scenarios, Inception is the movie that involves the viewer, challenges them throughout its entirety and rewards them with believable logic and dazzling imagination throughout its entirety. Inception never loses its emotional core despite all the twisted logic and mindbending space between dream and reality. A special mention should go to Marion Cotillard whose haunting portrayal as Mal sent shivers down my spine with dread every time she appeared on-screen. I would also applaud Nolan for keeping the ""craziness"" factor low for this movie (something which many critics complained about). I preferred the believable factor and how nothing ever seemed over-the-top mostly which further distorted the difference between reality and dreams further more. I preferred this rather than the movie taking a crazy Kubrick turn somewhere in the middle. In the end despite few rough edges and leap of faiths, Inception is a dazzling achievement in every right. It challenges the viewer with every sequence to suspend their belief on what is dream and reality. It is an achievement in the fact that original ideas when supplied with big- budgets can turn into incredibly powerful movies such as this one. But lastly and most importantly, it is an achievement of the fulfillment of the vision a man set to fulfill a decade back with an idea. The idea which has synthesized with the kind of cinema he has gained mastery over to form this single movie. And what a movie it really was.10/10"
119136,False,"even if you go in with high expectations you will come out astonishingly praising the director and the crew in mind.yes,Chris Nolan has done it again.you wont even take an eye or your mind even for a second till the end.once again Nolan has proved that not every thing depends on how great the story was but the way you present it.with an exceptional directing skills,good casting,haunting music by Hans Zimmer and a brilliant editing and cinematography,inception blew you minds off and special Thanks to the outstanding performance's from DiCaprio and Gordon-Levitt.The reason for loving this film is that its not a kind of rubbish meaningless high budget action flick.you have to keep your memory in mind to watch this movie from the very inception.A must watch movie worth's your every single penny spent on it.cheers to Chris Nolan 10/10 for his dreams.don't miss it in theaters in one word ""Inception is Exceptional""."
119137,False,"Clumsy, derivative, lazily scripted and massively over-long. I know this isn't what most people are saying about Inception but I'm afraid this is the cruel truth about the film. There is simply nothing new here, despite the ""originality"" everyone has credited the film with. If you've seen The Matrix, Dreamscape, Total Recall, Blade Runner, or Johnny Mnemonic (to name but a few) then there is going to be little here to surprise you. The opening half hour of the film spends its time frantically throwing complex and very clunky exposition at you in a desperate attempt to explain the highly contrived rules of the dreamworlds which provide the backdrop for much of the narrative. The action is there, but as always, Nolan struggles to film it in an exciting way, generally pushing the camera so close to his subject that it is impossible to really make out what is going on. Even the dream worlds in the film are remarkably bland and unimaginative - apparently we all dream as if we are in a Hollywood high-concept film dominated by CGI. The small scale nature of most dreams is nowhere to be found here and nor is any of the fascinating strangeness and mystery associated with dreaming; apparently the subconscious only really expresses itself in our dreams by manifesting itself as a lot of rather tetchy people who try to beat up anyone who invades the dreamer's mind (sound at all like the agents in The Matrix?). There are of course some impressive visual effects along the way (for instance at one point Paris suddenly folds back on itself so that streets run vertically and upside down like something from an M C Escher picture) but these are calculated simply for spectacle and Nolan really misses a trick in picking up the potentially genuinely fascinating subject of dreams and the way in which they link to the fantasy world of films. I'm sure this will be popular with a lot of teenage boys who might be impressed with the cod-philosophy of the film, but if you've seen any of the films listed in the first few lines of this review or if you've read novels by Philip K Dick or William Gibson, you aren't going to find much to engage with here. Massively over-rated, incredibly tedious and a waste of an excellent cast who, in fairness, do the best they can with the dreadful screenplay they were handed."
119138,False,"After a June filled with movies that wanted to be nothing but popcorn fun but ultimately your popcorn bucket emptied, we were all looking forward to Inception bringing something intelligent to the screen. Man, what a huge let down. I guess you can't blame Inception for expectations and for the crap that came before it but those factors may have led to the disappointment. People labeling this film as smart are doing nothing but exposing their own ignorance. Either that or else, they're exposing their own vast imagination because they must have filled in scenes in their own head to compensate for this films obvious shortcomings. There was no thought put into the dialogue and the effects are certainly awful. The action scenes are weak simply because they scream cartoon. I know they have the ""Matrix excuse"" that lets them warp reality but the CG is too bizarre for my taste. The shocking thing is that most of entire movie lacks real energy and especially lacks heart. Anyone else think there was little chemistry between the stars? Everyone besides Leo seemed to intentionally deliver no personality or charisma. I knew Nolan was going for an Indy-bizarre flavor. So, I expected little character development but I did expect to care about something or someone in the film. That really never happens. What a shame.Can filmgoers want to love a film so much that they block out how bad the film turned out? Or, will they be jaded holding it up to impossible expectations? Maybe my expectations were too high but I was greatly disappointed by this movie. The writers of this film and YES, the director took a promising concept and turned it in to a blathering waste of effort. Hope can be a strong thing but hoping so hard that you'll love a film that you actually fool yourself in to believing its good is genuinely unhealthy."
119139,False,"I suspected that the rave reviews for this movie came from mostly teenage/young boys, and that seems to be the case based on the polls. In fact, this movie is essentially impossible to follow, and worst of all, you won't care about a single character in it--not really, anyway. There is no drama, there are simply empty characters mouthing nonsense about dreams and dreams within dreams. It steals from the Matrix and other movies, and does a far worse job with similar material than those better movies did.Perhaps the first full hour or more is little more than chat that is full of hot air and psychobabble but that probably a lot of people in the audience don't bother thinking about. Everyone's waiting for the special effects, which do come along, but when they do, you probably won't care what happens or for that matter, even know what is happening. Vans falling from bridges, a snow fortress under attack--why? What? No matter. You'll be led to believe this all Means Something, but it doesn't, and worse, you'll feel nothing too."
119140,False,"Superficially, you know when this one winds to a close that you've just spent two and a half hours with the results of an over supportive studio giving Christopher Nolan, fresh from his huge Batman successes, way too much leeway.It's a bloated, convoluted, over-extended and ponderous film that has almost no reward in store for viewers when all's said and done. But still, even as you secretly hope it'll be the next Ishtar or Cutthroat Island, you know it's wrong to think like that. You know there was still a truckload of vision and good intentions involved in the making of Inception, and you keep thinking that maybe this is the rare summer movie to attempt delivery of an intelligent construct to generally numb and switched off audiences.The truth lies somewhere in between. Inception suffers from some factual failings that can't be denied - it's too long, for one. Then, the plot turns out surprisingly thin, so in order to fill the runtime, Nolan and Co resorted to severe repetition, so we're put through the same sequences time and again. Yet, there's no tension. You can figure out the entire affair for yourself in advance. Do not expect any twists when going into Inception, and actually the most tense moment comes right at the end, although we suspect that's because you're worried the suspense is leading into yet another scene.Then, we get to the performances. Nobody does a really bang up job here, although no one falls too short of the mark. DiCaprio delivers basically the same character he was in Blood Diamond and Body of Lies, except he doesn't yell at the people on the phone as much this time. Otherwise it's the same reluctant gun for hire routine. He plays the oddly named Dom Cobb, a specialist in extraction. That's not a dental reference, it just means he's a dream hacker, able to infiltrate the sleeping minds of others and steal valuable information. This dream world is presented as a virtual reality straight out of The Matrix, including hostile locals and bizarre physics.Cobb gets hired for one more big job by a powerful industrialist (Ken Watanabe), who needs his talents to interdict a rival family (Cillian Murphy and Pete Postlethwaite). But Cobb can't do the job alone, so he puts together an entire crew, including assistant Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and architect Ariadne (Ellen Page), among others. The job becomes increasingly complicated, though, mostly because Cobb is haunted by his beloved wife (Marion Cotillard), who's somewhat of an antagonist, albeit a rather mundane and annoying one.What ensues exposes the failings of Inception. The narrative is just too long for it's own good, and presented in a manner that promotes repetition over ingenuity, despite the vision we mentioned before. Inception takes obvious cues from previous science fiction and surrealism entries, but at least it's honest enough to not dwell on the technicalities of just how Cobb and his posse manage to penetrate other people's dreams like that. Aside from the positive, there are mostly negatives, as you're compelled out of some basic decency to keep watching, hoping for things to take a swing in the right direction. That never happens, and Inception remains a middling exercise in over extension start to finish.Most of the effort and talent here have evidently gone towards the visual richness of the feature, which doesn't disappoint. There are some excellent effects, landscapes, costumes and settings involved, but they're not enough to distract from the overall emptiness of this movie. Were it 30 minutes shorter, then maybe Inception could have been commendable for aesthetic endeavor, but as it stands, those pluses are drowned by the lacking storytelling on show. While not a complete disaster, Inception will get you started on the path to your next movie outing real quick."
119141,False,"Without exaggeration,i can say I had never waited for anything in my life like i waited for Inception.I was keeping update of every single development and news about the movie,i can say i was getting hysterical ,and the reasons are quite clear as both my favorite actor and director of my generation ,Leonardo Di Caprio and Christopher Nolan come together ,my favorite newcomer actors Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon Lewitt they are all together in one movie,it is like a dream come true and the movie itself explores the world of Dreams,the boundless world of dreams where you are free from any limitation of real world to imagine and create anything you want.It is action,sci-fi,romance,you find everything here,every grand scale entertainment that we experience from watching different movies brought in a single movie(as Chris Nolan said),a movie we all dreamt about and Christopher Nolan made it real.When the movie released and after reading dozens of reviews,i came to decision that i will not see this movie till the hypes get over so that i could make own point-of-view on the movie.But i was unable to control myself.Now,the movie has released in my city,the dubbed version actually,in Hindi and they also renamed it in Hindi as ""Chakravyuha"" which means ""Labyrinth"" which also seemed quite sensible to me.The dubbing was perfect,with brilliant translation and synchronization, and the selection of voices for actors were also fantastic.In short,they didn't spoiled the movie like they did to Harry Potter and Avatar .We watched the movie in empty cinema hall(there were only 40-50 peoples present in the capacity of 300) which was not surprising for me,as no one care much about Christopher Nolan movies here,except few movie aficionados like me.Watching Inception was the experience like seeing a miracle from you own eyes ,a entertainment for your mind, body and soul.This movie satisfied me completely from every point of view,like i said before this movie is a complete package,this movie makes us think deeply and explores subconscious of human mind and make us realize the power of it.The completely original and personal work of Christopher Nolan with some inevitable influences of other movies like Matrix but this doesn't make this movie unoriginal ,the idea of traveling into the subconscious of human's mind and steal his idea or even seeding an idea in his subconscious is completely new,mind-blowing and ground-breaking concept,the brilliant action and chasing sequences maintained adrenalin rush in your body,and also a very heart-touching love story that doesn't seemed out-of-place but the vital part of the movie.This brilliant concept get the full support from Warner Bros. who can take such a high risk and give full freedom to their director,grand scale production which made the sets and special effects looks so real. Brilliant performances from every single cast as they were portraying the beautifully created characters with such depth that made their work very challenging.The soundtrack of the movie is mesmerizing and added great feel to the movie.Inception may not be the best,may not be the most perfect and flawless movie ever made but certainly it is the most complete grand scale entertainment movie,so far."
119142,False,"All of the complaints that I have seen about this movie were ones explaining how viewers did not understand the movie. Honestly, the movie is really simple to follow, if you pay attention. I've only seen it one time and I understood everything. Many are saying that they want to see it twice in order to grasp everything, but one viewing is enough if comprehension is all you want to get out of the second viewing. This being said, I would love to see this movie a second time. The acting is outstanding and the chemistry between the actors makes the movie so pleasant to watch. You instantly forget that these are actors. The chemistry between Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon Levitt is phenomenal. Also, Leonardo is unbelievable as always, and no one can look better in a suit. The topic is so engaging and I would recommend this movie to anyone. It has been my favorite movie so far this year, and I will definitely be purchasing it as soon as it comes out onto DVD. Spend the money, see the movie, pay attention, and everything will be great."
119143,False,"OK, Inception is, in my opinion, the culmination of everything that's wrong with the movie biz these days.Awful dialog and no characterization, stock actors who give stock performances, plot holes that are covered by the a fore mentioned awful dialog and weak characterization, an inability to explain much of the way the dream world and limbo work, and the ambiguity of the entire movie is quite over the top. If something isn't done soon, movies like Inception will be considered great works of film when the people who work on them don't even take the time to have a coherent storyline."
119144,False,"Reaping money like there's no tomorrow and rocketing to the top of IMDb to contend with even The Godfather and Shawshank, Inception has had nothing but success since its release. An incredible sceptic toward all things popular, especially in their earliest days, I fully expected this to be quite poor and overrated.Working as an independent dream-thief, Dom Cobb is tasked with the more difficult job of implanting a thought within the mind of a subject, the promise of reunion with the family from which he is estranged his motivation to do so. Forging a team of assorted talents, he plans an intricate network of dreams and deceit whilst simultaneously coping with increasingly realistic memories of the past.When a film garners almost universal acclaim and high rankings all around, discussion turns quickly away from the work itself, and more towards its accolades. Such is certainly the case with Inception, its current spot at number 3 on the top 250 as much the subject of discussion boards as the (soi-disant) intricacies of its plot. Like its predecessor in Nolan's filmography, The Dark Knight, Inception is now praised variously as genius, brilliant, revolutionary, and ""the greatest film ever"". Yet almost for every fanboy who screams the wonders of this sci-fi epic is a cynic, tutting with disapproval and angrily muttering about the decline of modern civilisation. What we're currently seeing is a replay of Nolan's fortunes just two years ago. Some call him the new Kubrick, others dismiss him as a glorified Michael Bay. The arguments between these two camps have been the subject of more discussion than the film's merits, or lack thereof; indeed such is the content of this ""review"" so far. My point: people feel compelled by such acclaim to either love the film, or to hate it, leaving a disturbing imbalance in its ratings. Unless you take a stand and proclaim it ludicrous garbage, anything other than unending praise will see you labelled a thoughtless moron, incapable of artistic appreciation or sagacious thought. Those who rate it a 1 out of 10 are making a point, refusing to stand for overrating. The simple fact is that Inception is a good film: entertaining; interesting; superb looking; well-acted; well-directed. Is it a masterpiece? No, absolutely not. Its flaws are many, both logically and cinematically; its moments of brilliance few. Aside from excellent effects and anti-gravitational fight sequences, it holds insufficient emotional impact to transcend the general mediocrity of its genre: the heist thriller in essence. And that is it. The film is perfectly entertaining, but at no stage is it anything special. I enjoyed myself, but certainly see nothing within it to warrant such vigorous fanaticism. And the ending was silly, overused, and lazy.A key example of the way in which people forget what they really should be discussing, Inception has become naturally presumed as a deep and thoughtful movie, probing far into recondite things and leaving us to formulate our own theories and opinions. In truth it is a standard action film, delivering a solid chunk of appealing-to-the-eye entertainment (some of the best for a while), but little more. Its plot is complex rather than its meaning, a key mistake audiences will continue to make as they argue and bicker. I just wish people could sit back and enjoy the film, rather than messing their pants at every halfway decent movie that hits the screen."
119145,False,"But it's got its heart in the right place. First it's too long by at least a half-hour. Second it relies too much on frenetic activity to cover up its more grievous shortfalls. And third it's not really sci-fi, it's more a psychological thriller. But despite all that it is what it is portraying, an attempt to implant a notion, and that's highly commendable on several levels. Also a few of the scenes are both memorable and essentially flawless.The acting's all there too despite what some critics claim. DiCaprio is capable and fully invested. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance is especially engaging, but the casting of Ellen Page was a near fatal mistake if you ask me. I can see why she made sense to the director and producers, but she's a drag on the movie as is Ken Watanabe who I could barely understand half the time. Still I like his acting and I can tolerate his pronunciation here. Page I don't like for some reason. Perhaps it's just too distracting and/or annoying to see her exude an almost pre-adolescent lack of experience again. If they needed an 'innocent', and I don't really agree, I would have preferred Dakota Fanning. Marion Cotillard does the exact opposite, she's worldly and knowing, but her I'd like to protect and get to know personally.I would have liked to see a slower more moody treatment of this topic. Though at least one of the chase scenes is masterful and hair-raising, the real pay dirt would have been imagining trying to enter another person's mind. In fact the separation between our minds is the bedrock on which most of our problems lay. A 'shared dream' as portrayed here would have been several notches more paradigm breaking than depicted here, I think, and that's no small flaw in this film."
119146,False,"I loved it. OK, I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and I love dark movies with great twists. I loved Memento..Prestige, I had to watch it twice to understand it.I have seen dreams inside dreams inside dreams, so I got the movie from the moment it started. I will not spoil it too much but everything in the movie are explained clearly. The mystery of the movie is inside the mind of Cobb. He is hiding his subconscious guilt and still playing the game of inception with his team members. This is the most difficult job he has to do and all the time he is haunted by his wife. The movie is understandable. Leonardo Dicaprio's one of the best performance after The Blood Diamond. Ellen Page is absolutely the character Nolan wanted from her. She is a brilliant architect and also curious about all the mysteries that goes around Cobb's life. This is the first movie I have seen of Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I loved his character, balanced and funny sometimes. This is the first movie of this summer that I am going to watch a second time and may be third."
119147,False,"9.4? ? ? ? ? Wow I went and saw it tonight because of all the Hype. I decided to stay level headed because the previews did not look that great. I went into it with medium expectations, and it was still a huge let down. Honestly I would give it a 3/10 for its cinematography and effects. It lacks everything everything that makes a great or even a good movie. The characters weren't developed besides Leonardo's and they were all bland and uninteresting. There are about 4 different subplot-like events going on and it creates for the viewer to be very disconnected, you never sympathize or empathize for anyone or anything in the movie, let alone give a damn about its very uninteresting story. The story was all over the place dragged out and bland, I felt disconnected from the whole plot. Good premiss, cool idea, good graphics.... Story was border line awful, acting was just average for such good actors, the characters were bland and sucked, the dialogue got wacky and pretty out there and didn't even make sense at times. the cinematography was all over the place. These past 2 years the IMDb rating has been corrupted or screwed. This is not, not, not a great or even a good movie. One of my least favorite Decaprio and Nolans films. The Dark Knight must have got to his head. Could we see another lost director like Tarentino? Apparently not to general audience who are apparently mindlessly entertained and think everything that is confusing is wonderful."
119148,False,"Wow! Another super overrated movie from the guy who brought us the Dark Knight. And of course its totally overrated. After watching like 5 minutes you can tell this movie is going to be awfully boring. The story may be interesting and the effects up to date but the movie is still not worth a watch. How can this have so many good reviews and an average rating of 9,1?? Were we watching the same movie? Leonardo di Caprio playing himself as usual, Christopher Nolan directing like somebody with an IQ of 2 and the rest is Hollywood plastic. So whoever has some brain in his head should be wondering how someone can possible enjoy such a boring movie."
119149,False,"9.1 / 10 on IMDb? So ~91% of Earth's population is asleep, these people like the film so much, because it tells them of fantahstic possibilities of dream state.Well I don't want to wake up anyone forcefully, espehcially since propagation of the weird reality of the American Dream, but speaking from an outsider's observation-point: looking at all your bodies with your eyes wide-open but frozen in deep-sleepYou all are so vulnerable in your dream!Since your birth it has been continuous, stabilized by swallowing Matrix-blue pills. Greatest drama is you will never wake up what happens at the final moment may resemble an individual in coma whose heart or brain stops."
119150,False,"This movie is a joke. 9.1 rating on IMDb? Better than Dark Knight, Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, Braveheart? After 10 minutes I just wanted to get out of the cinema, girls made me stay, and I suffered for 2 hours. Ridiculous plot. The whole idea is a mess. As soon as I realized, what this movie was all about, I just wanted to drop it. Chris Nolan, The Dark Knight is the best ever(due to Heath Ledger), but this one? It is beautifully executed, excellently done. It would be a masterpiece film, but this plot, this nonsense! Nonsense is the best way to describe this. There are movies, which are complicated, and I love'em. But to over-complicate a nonsense? Watch South Park's new episode(Insheeption)! That one tells you exactly, what this movie is like. Do not compare it with Matrix. That one is credible, possible, you can find logic in it, but not in Inception. I do not remember the last time, I wanted out of a cinema after 10 minutes! I would not recommend this movie to anyone! Nevertheless, Long live Chris Nolan!"
119151,False,"Epic Fail.People are to plug in a cable to some black box, close their eyes and become visitors in other's heads? Come on - thats way too simple and too far away, if not absolutely impossible anywhere in our universe, and never will.Given that, it's nearly impossible for me to get a grip into that film. Too unrealistic. One's think all the time is ""that cannot be"".""So is fiction!"" one might admit.But for me Inception lacks the ability to lead its spectator over ""that final threshold"" that lets us forget just and right that.I love C.Nolans interpretation of the Memento Mori. Kinda realistic. Thrilling. One real classic.Inception is not. Look what happened to Avatar in #Top250."
119152,False,"I was disappointed. I had great expectations from the film and I was let down. The story was predictable, nothing was left on viewer's imagination, the constant talking and explanation(in any single scene)was unnecessary. The techniques of direction were pioneering, but the story lacking of depth. The development of the character's personality was short, as a result the lack of connection between the movie's characters and the viewers. I expected more silent scenes and less gunfire. Nollan, this time, was arrogant,underestimating the viewer's mind. The move was like a ""blockbusterous"" imitation of memento. It was nothing new.I found myself sleeping after the break. When the movie ended ""I was old and regarded""."
119153,False,"This is by far my most disappointing movie experience in years. Its not really that its that bad. I would probably have given it 7 stars if it wasn't for the unbelievable 9.1 average, which sent me to the theater with such high expectations.First of all, I have to get this of my chest: ITS NOT THAT ORIGINAL! In 1998 a by-now-forgotten film by the title of Dark City was released, with a strikingly similar premise, but with better writing, a tighter plot and a fraction of the budget of this monstrosity. Do yourself a favor, watch it.Back to Inception: The casting is good, the performances vary between average to good, and in general they more or less work together. But the characters lack any real depth, the dialog is mediocre and the pervasive pseudo-science conversations are down-right silly.Visually its stunning, ground-breaking, with more special effects than you could ever wish for, but quite often pointless. The same goes for the action sequences, amazing yes, but often out of place and you can't shake the feeling that they were forced into the plot: OK guys, its been three minutes since something exploded or someone used a grenade launcher, stuff an action scene in here.Worst of all: the premise of the film is ridiculous but there is nothing that makes it believable. This, I think, is the mark of a great Sci-Fi flick: you completely buy into the premise no matter how ridiculous it is. Inception fails.Does it have better entertainment value/ is it a better film than:Shutter Island: No, but comes close/ No, doesn't even come closeDistrict 9: No, D9 is 3 times more fun/ No, God No, in what dreamworld?Clash of the Titans: Yes/ YesThe A-Team: About the same/ Yes, its better than The A-TeamAvatar: No/ NoFinally, Dark City: bang-for-buck, Yes/ No, even though Dark City has a weaker cast its still the better movie,"
119154,False,"The moving is a'Maze'ing and you will come out of the maze (read cinema) in just a tad less than 2 and half hours, fully refreshed and satisfied. Watched the first show of the day at 12 noon (India Time) which I guess means it is yet to be released in US while I am writing the review.Another DiCaprio thriller after Shutter Island and that too in the same year. DiCaprio has done just 11 movies since Titanic came out in 1997 and probably you can name them all, he is that selective). Too good to be true. Actually it is too good as although you cant and shouldn't compare, Christopher Nolan has matched Martin Scorsese and has probably outdone himself compared to TDK. Forget the complexity about the plot of a dream within a dream within a dream, what will linger are the amazing visuals caught in slo-mo. Everything seems to fall in place like a Swiss watch that by the end of the movie all your questions and 'how did that' gets answered.There is a lot of similarity between Inception and Shutter Island and the similarity is that they are like North and South Poles. That different yet nonetheless they are poles, right.I do not want to give the story one bit because that is the beauty of this movie's concept, the story unfolds with almost every scene and there is always the suspense that the story just might take a dramatic turn in each frame and does it take the turn or turns? Well, go watch for yourself and you will feel like writing a review yourself.All the actors are good and plays to the character, but the thing is the movie is so damn brilliant, I guess Nolan could have just about cast anybody and it would still have turned out a'Maze'ing."
119155,False,"This movie has some great special effects. The acting is pretty decent. That is about all I can say to its credit. Inception is a textbook example of the Hollywood hype machine in full effect.The much-vaunted plot is interesting but derivative, failing to live up to its 'mind-bending' reputation. You would be much better off watching a film like Videodrome or the animated film Mindgame if you want to truly be thrown sideways. This one is about as deep as Total Recall, but takes itself about ten times as seriously.I gave this a one merely as a corrective to the ridiculously high score that only a team of studio clerks working round the clock could have pushed to such a level. All in all it is a quite enjoyable film. I would watch it on TV if there was not much else on. But that is as far as it goes. There, now you are fully inoculated against the hype, go fourth and watch or not, free from utopian delusions."
119156,False,"Oh man this film wasn't really that good and I'll try to explain why without giving anything away.Firstly let me just say that I've always been a fan of Christopher Nolan, and whilst I've never particularly been a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio his recent films particularly shutter island changed that view and I've actually started to like him he's surely grown as an actor over the years, furthermore, there are other talented cast in there but Joseph Gordon-Levitt I think was a bad choice for this movie he just didn't suit his role.OK now onto the actual film, the ideas were there, so was the budget and the cast so were did it all go so wrong? With a mixture of the directing and writing things got too deep and generally quite cryptic that felt a little hacky at times. It's not greatly structured nor does it seem well thought out, I think they tried to put so many twists and turns on the movie that it just wasn't that enjoyable; I totally understood it but the time they spent putting too many twists and turns in it could and should have been spent using deeper character development and general creativity opposed to just making things as non-linear as possible.4/10 and that's being generous"
119157,False,"After experiencing NOLAN's earlier works(The Prestige, Memento & Dark Knight) i actually have a faith on INCEPTION. And guess what..... i was absolutely right. INCEPTION is by most NOLAN's finest combination of storytelling & action at the same time with same pace. The amazing concept of dreams and thieves mixed up in a very cinematic way that take your breath away. The very first frame of the movie itself told the audiences that they are watching something extraordinary. HANZ ZIMMER awesome BG score keeps the movie alive and fantastic Visual Fx makes it more real and terrific in every sense......so DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR... go and watch INCEPTION........."
119158,False,"After watching the midnight premiere, my friends and I came up with a theory behind Christopher Nolan and his Inception movie. While he was making Inception Christopher Nolan needed more funding therefore he decided to make the Dark Knight. Sadly Heath Ledger passed away but his death brought more fame and fortune than Nolan expected. He was planning on reusing ALL actors in the Dark Knight but Christian Baile went on a drama-queen rampage on set against the lighting director causing Nolan to lean towards DiCaprio as his lead. (This came about because Nolan happened to be sipping tea with Scorsese one lovely evening, discussing Shutter Island and how fantastically adorable DiCaprio was in thrillers.) The Dark Knight was at best a side project because what Director Christopher Nolan REALLY had in mind was to F*** with our sense of reality through HIS thriller, Inception.No movie has ever caused me physical pain except this one. i was cringing from suspense. Every muscle in my body ached. my lungs were collapsed and when i tried to stand up after the credits i just couldn't. i just could not BREATHE. my eyes still sting. why? because the entire movie, my eyes were GLUED to the screen and i probably blinked, oh lets say, ZERO times. driving back from the theater, i lost my voice raving about the movie with my friends. and Hans Zimmer? i made my own Hollywood Star for him in the backyard. the grass spell out his name. i loved this movie. Pick and pull at it all you want, it was fantastic."
119159,False,"I want this to be a very accurate and very constructive review of Inception, because it seems like people are either overly bashing it or overrating it out there and I don't think that's right. Personally, I wouldn't listen to any critic (not even me) when it comes to Inception because whether or not you like this movie depends completely on you. If you're looking for deep and complex characters, I don't know if Inception is for you. If you're searching for an action film full of explosions and exciting car chases, I'm still not sure if Inception is the right movie for you. But I could be wrong.Inception cannot really be explained in words without giving much away because of the story's complexity but I will tell you this.. Don't go into Inception totally blind. Know that you're about to watch a confusing movie that will make you think. You should also know certain aspects of the plot. For those aspects, I'd go to the synopsis located at the bottom of this review because it is the best description you will find on the internet. Okay, now that I got that over with, here's what I think about Inception: It is a truly mind blowing experience. Some scenes in this movie will leave you with your jaw dropped. I can assure you that some of the stuff that you will see in Inception is like nothing you've ever seen before. With that being said, it doesn't save Inception from falling short of a fantastic movie. This isn't a mindless action flick, but there is little emotion in some characters. When it comes to the main character, Cobb, you do have a lot of emotion and his character does have some depth. But when it comes to other characters like Ellen Page's Ariadne, you'll get almost no emotion at all. Some characters are only present in Inception to provide exposition or do something to allow the story to move forward. Because of that, it's hard to praise Inception as a masterpiece.I should let you know though, just because the emotion isn't really there, every actor did the best they could with their role in the film. The other performances are a bit overshadowed by Leonardo DiCaprio's, which was no doubt his best performance to date, but they were still great. And because I'm on that subject, I should add that Watanabee and Hardy have very strong accents in this movie, that are a little hard to understand at times.Exspeaking of accents, Christopher Nolan's directing was top notch. (Don't ask why accents have anything to do with Nolan's directing because I don't know either, I just needed a way to get on the subject.) Nolan has improved drastically since The Dark Knight in terms of directing action sequences. They are no longer choppy, they flow very well and are some of the best I've ever seen. (I mean that.) And Zimmer is there to help out, with an incredible score that I believe is one of his best. I believe that this is Nolan's second best movie in terms of directing, just behind Memento which was masterfully put together.To sum everything up, Inception is fantastic when it comes to action and suspense but falls a bit short with emotion, but it's made up for by great acting and the depth of Cobb's character. (which is really the only character that matters...) However, because of this, Inception is far from a masterpiece. I'm going to reward Inception with four stars (ten on IMDb) because I believe it is the best films of the year so far, and is one of my personal favorites.Synopsis: http://screenrant.com/inception-plot-synopsis-deatails-mikee-58124/****/****"
119160,False,"In this movie, Nolan picks up the Freudian Theory of dream and pens an intelligent and surreal script from it although he seems to borrow some of this ideas from a Japanese anime movie Paprika. However, to condemn this movie as a Hollywood CGI polished ripoff of Paprika is preposterous. Inception stands on his own because it has an entirely different plot and characters.The best thing about this movie are the settings, with a ton of dream within a dream within a dream worlds, for me at least Nolan successfully presents us with a fairly coherent state of one's dream (coherent enough to be filmed with CGI at least) without losing the glorious incomprehensibleness of dream itself. However, sadly all of the best CGIs and dream worlds stuffs here on this movie has been spoiled in the trailer, the folding city, the zero gravity hotel room and the icy fortresses.The acting quality of what could be considered the best all-star casts in any 2010 movie complements the set and plot nicely without any particular character chewing the scenery. However, somewhat annoyingly in my opinion DiCaprio's acting falls short and feels a little bit dull compared to the sheer awesomeness of the environment. His character seems distracted and somewhat bored throughout the movie. His inner struggle projected in the dream settings throughout the movie in my opinion totally distracts the flow of the plot and completely unnecessary since we have already seen DiCaprio struggles against his own mental projection and questioning reality in another movie. Shutter ** cough.. cough.. Now that I've written three paragraphs about this movie, I felt that I'm somehow being to harsh. This is a really good movie, for me it holds a respectable second best movie in 2010 after Toy Story 3 and definitely a top 10 movie in this decade. The action is really intense and the dream worlds presented by Nolan are really top notch. Although the sub-plot DiCaprio's mental stuff kinda drags a little bit, it doesn't decrease the sheer volatile awesomeness of this movie."
119161,False,"Nolan gets lost/off in the baroque intricacies of his ""mind-bending"" plot at the expense of pretty much everything else. The talents of the many excellent actors thrown together to create this pretentious, money-sucking crap are simply wasted. Don't expect any fire from these pieces of wood.Nolan asks the viewer to turn his brain on just enough to try to follow the idea (you have to suffer through an unbearable amount of exposition), but then hopes that enough action, effects and oppressive soundtrack will stun that same brain into not questioning the ridiculous character motives, sloppy plot contrivances, and breaking and bending of his movie's own rules. If you feel like you haven't heretofore been sufficiently crushed by suspension of disbelief and reason, then this is your movie.As an aside, the movie felt like a converted book or graphic novel and it's likely this non-existent original medium would have allowed for a more credible attempt at floating this turd."
119162,False,"It should be called ""Deception"". Or ""James Bond Meets The Matrix"". Take the worst bits of James Bond and the worst bits of The Matrix movies, randomly mix them together, and you have ""Inception"".It's pretentious nonsense from start to finish. The characters are caricatures, the acting is formulaic, and the plot! Jeez. It starts badly and gets worse. By the end, even the director couldn't be bothered and lets it degenerate into a standard James Bond movie (complete with men in snow suits fighting on skis).The age rating (12A in the UK) means the ideal demographic for this movie (8 year-old boys) can't see it. This film is so bad, it creeps into classic-bad-movie territory. Oh, by the way, I ""get it"". I just don't ""like it"". And the movie is not existentialist. It's pointless.I like to say something positive about every movie I see but I am struggling with this one. Oh, I have something: it has a great ending - because it ends."
119163,False,"I would like to warn everyone that this movie is seriously overrated. Based on the rating here I decided to see it in the cinema, I wish I hadn't. It's not entertaining and plain boring, and much too long and repetitive. The characters are boring and very plain. It's almost like watching a couple of zombies of watching paint dry. It could have easily been an hour shorter. Plot holes are all over the place, nothing is properly explained and it's nothing but philosophical mumbo jumbo. Even the action was boring and unexceptional. I wouldn't even see it again if they paid me to do so (although maybe for enough cash I would). A large part of the audience that was in the theatre with me seemed to agree, because I heard only negative reactions. I gave it a 1 because a 9 is seriously overrated."
119164,False,"Inception is a decent action movie. It's well acted and produced. The weaknesses are on story and message side. Plot is pretty obvious. Overall Inception is mixing some 007 stuff we've seen in several other occasions and something matrix like with on-the-surface multileveled story. Worst of all, the message of the movie (which deals somehow with the love, reality and letting go of the sad past) is left vague and superficial. It simply did not touch me. To put it short, Inception seemed came through to me as a bagful of old tricks covered with some special effects.Movie definitely is not worth the current 9.2 rating in IMDb. Being social media professional, the unreasonably high rating of an average movie leads me to wonder if social media has been commercially manipulated."
119165,False,"This movie is not complicated. This movie is not complex. This movie is an excellently acted excuse to put the most astounding weaving together of action sequences ever performed on film.It's mind-numbingly beautiful and if you ever saw an action movie you liked, this movie is close to perfection. This movie is literally a movie that will make you edge forward on your cinema seat and if you feel you have outgrown action movies, then this flick will make you 12 again.The actors are good and they close together the gaps in the action effectively and quickly. The cutting is probably the finest I have ever seen, and the music orchestrates the events perfectly.See it!"
119166,False,"While just as silly and more or less pointless as his earlier flicks, Nolan has created in Inception a decent enough heist movie. Just think of it as a movie about a multi-layered holodeck program, however, designed by programmers familiar with Counter Strike, cinematography, and disaster movies, since the idea of dreams in this film is quite banal and undreamlike, really - they are capitalist espionage tools with all the subconscious removed, or rather, translated into what is familiar to Nolan - a kind of Michael Bay alternate reality. The story, touted as complex, is complex only on the level that it is a heist movie - a fairly straightforward and very linear heist movie. There's no psychology (one character's statement that ""it's all about X"" is the entire psychological content of the film - the oldest trope in the book becomes a single, meaningless line) philosophy, ethics, and certainly no spirituality involved. I've seen some making comparisons to Solaris, either Tarkovsky's or Soderburgh's, but these are specious comparisons, made in a desperate attempt to elevate Nolan's vacant shenanigans. Don't believe it. The film is a hoax. It's fun, but it's a hoax. Nolan's characters are all self-centered and only speak the technobabble or reductionist claptrap Nolan forces into their mouths, there's not a shred of intellect anywhere.One step above a Michael Bay creation, and that's it."
119167,False,"I have been eagerly waiting to see this film and the first impression after walking out of the theater was deception. The world of dreams is a world of opportunities to make a perfect film but too much dreams kill the dream. I find the locations of the filming a bit gray and as one of the characters said: why didn't they dream something sunny. As for the plot, since the beginning of the film you keep asking yourself is he dreaming this or not, which gives the movie another tone. Also I find the plot and the characters a bit gray as well as for their motives. But if you watch it as an action film you will be entertained. For me this film doesn't deserve to be in the top ten IMDb."
119168,False,"Movie  InceptionTo watch and feel the Inception movie . Here's my tip - Watch the days last show and then go to sleep, u'll definitely wake up two or three times to check whether u r are dreaming or not(u can even use a spinning top to check whether u r dreaming or not _ as used by Mr.Cob in the movie) . Sorry guys, but that is the hangover u take with u after watching the movie.OK ! Let's start the review. Why did I went to watch this movie  1. It's written by C. Nolan and guess what, he also is the director of this movie. 2. The story of dream invasion,it's not easy to make a film on this subject. 3. The cast made it more appeal-able. 4. New (fresh new) special effect scenes.Highlighting point of the movie  1.It is a story about dream invasion, where the characters goes into the dream of Jr. Fischer and wants to implant a new IDEA , which is not easy ,as the new IDEA will not be accepted by Jr. Fischer (or any person) because its somebody Else's thought or an IDEA. 2. So, to make it possible, they have a plan. And it is the execution of this plan which is shown in the movie. 3. To be very honest, it's not a fairy tale story or a fantasy kind of movie/story. 4. The technical aspects of this movie are immaculate, because every action had its true reaction. The use of Science (Physics) used in this movie is awesome.5. The story is very real in its hypothesis, For e.g.  a) If the Van is falling from a bridge into the water in 1 min (in the 1st dream), then it will wake up the guys in 10 mins in the 2nd layer of their dream and 30 mins for the guys in the 3nd layer of the dream  and many more examples which is kept very realistic. About the director Standing ovation for Mr. Christopher Nolan. 1. For writing this movie/story. 2. To make or direct a movie exactly as it is written.3.Even though the story is very complicated, Nolan helped us to understand this movie. You can feel his efforts, and he did everything to make this movie understandable. In fact Inception is much easy to understand than Memento.4. He has done a fine job in maintain the pace and suspense. There isn't any dull moment in the movie. 5. Special effects were new. Look out for Joseph Gordon-Levitt fight.Performances  1. Leonardo is the star of this movie2. Tom Hardy(Handsome Bob ) is the second in the performance3. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the stylish and sexy. Summary  I am a reviewer who does not enter the story in my review if the film is good. So, sorry No clues Just watch the days last show and then go to sleep, u'll definitely wake up two or three times to check whether u r are dreaming or not(u can even use a spinning top to check whether u r dreaming or not _ as used by Mr.Cob in the movie)"
119169,False,"There are many movie mysteries in life: What did Bob say to Charlotte in Lost in Translation? What will the second Kill Bill sequel called? Will Toy Story 3 make or break my childhood dreams? But out of all of these obscurities, the knowledge that Inception will, in all likelihood be as overlooked at the upcoming Academy Awards as Nolan's last film: The Dark Knight, is the most frustrating.Unlike his iconic mish-mash chronology of his prior filmography, the narrative (though not for once without it's thought provoking logic) generally remains undemanding and plausible.Dom Cobb (DiCaprio) understands the infectious power of an idea or otherwise known as: 'The greatest parasite'. Notwithstanding his highly perilous job, which is usually to remove an idea from a set target, he now has to, in order to save his family, triumph the widely considered impossibility of an inception: The ability to plant an idea within the mind of a victim rather than remove it.Less than a year fresh from his first class Shutter Island performance, DiCaprio firmly remains a beacon of admiration to aspiring young actors yet again. Undeniably a riveting performance. Juno's Ellen Page helps clarify sense of the psychotic dream state as a newly recruited member of the group, making the triumphant tale and importance of Inception less confusing than expected. Support also comes from talented Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard and Michael Caine  who to Nolan refers to as his lucky charm; not that he needs one.Nolan, having now just finished his 7th film, with four of his previous works among the IMDb top 250, all with certified freshness and a scarcely small amount of Oscar nominations, at the very least deserves a Best Director Nomination for the Memento movie making maestro. And sadly it looks like we'll have to wait a long time to find that outSummer disappointments be gone. Inception is here."
119170,False,"when some one says that a movie surpasses all your expectations no matter how high they are... as a matter of fact very few movies really do it... this movie is one of them. With this movie Nolan, perhaps one of the finest directors of all time creates himself a new genre which defies all the other ones. Science fictions with dramatic stories and improvisations surrounded with intellectual aura. Some say that 4-D cant be done. This movie undoes that belief too. You can feel the aura of beauty surrounding you while watching the movie. Nolan has improvised himself on all aspects of movie making. The seat gripping scenes, amazing dialogs and the spectacular movie telling is quite evident on the screen. The story races with an amazing speed but manages to keep you to be right on the track. The movie comes up with a rare collaboration of perfection in all aspects. DiCaprio dazzles with another award winning performance. I would really feel sorry for the Oscars if they miss the privilege to honor him this year. People tend to compare this with a segment of classics like the matrix, star-wars. Well actually it surpasses them all. These movies are based on an IDEA. And they stop at there. A single idea and the story is segmented on that. Nolan has the impeccable capacity to pick up a dramatic story with in an idea an build a piece of art from it. Thats what distinguishes him from the herd. This movie is another such movie, though this is not exactly another movie.Watch this movie in the theaters. You really need to kill piracy for this movie. Final verdict... 10/10"
119171,False,"Christopher Nolan's 'Inception' is amongst the Best Films Ever Made! Usually, films have their share of minuses and flaws... surprise, surprise, surprise, 'Inception' is the first film since 'The Shawshank Redemption' that stabs words like ""Flaw"" and ""Minus""! Nolan's lucid dream is brought to life with 'Inception'. What happens when you enter the World of Dreams and it's motives, is so unusual, so interesting, so gripping and so amazing... that your left asking for more. By now, you know what this Masterstorke is about, but believe me... you have no idea what's in store for you! 'Inception' grabs your attention from the very start, and as mentioned before, leaves you awe-struck. And yes, 'Inception' packs in THE Best Climax Ever! It's simply astounding!!Nolan makes his careers best film in 'Inception'. His screenplay is EPIC, and his direction should land him an Academy-Award for Best Director! Wally Pfister's cinematography is sure to compliment him with numerous awards in the coming time. Music by Hans Zimmer, as always, is perfect.Each and Every Actor excels over-here: Leonardo DiCaprio takes the lead and steals the show. The star-actor becomes Dom Cobb, and delivers a memorable performance. Ellen Page is fantastic. Marion Cotillard is magnificent. Michael Caine, in a brief role, is flawless. Tom Hardy is very good, this is his best performance to date. Joseph Gordon-Levitt gets a role of a lifetime, and he sinks his teeth into it. Ken Watanabe is stylish, while Cillian Murphy is highly efficient. Tom Berenger is perfect. Dileep Rao is good.On the whole, Nolan's 'Inception' is worth your time and money. Let me put it this way: ""If your a Cinema-Fan, than watching 'Inception' is a must""! Two Big Thumbs Up!"
119172,False,"What drew me to watch this film on the very first day of theatrical showing was the cast, which was an incredible array of some of the most intense actors in Hollywood today. We have Ken Watanabe, Cilian Murphy, Marion Cotillard, Michael Caine, Tom Berenger, Pete Postlethwait, and in the lead, none other than Leonardo di Caprio. The director and writer Christopher Nolan also comes with a very impressive oeuvre behind him, with ""Memento,"" ""The Prestige,"" and most recently, ""The Dark Knight.""This film is one of the most complicated films I have seen. A fair summary is almost impossible to put into words. It is challenging to follow all the jumping into and out of dreams, in dreams within dreams. I won't be surprised if you do not completely understand everything that was going on by the end. However, the visual experience of being in this multi-layered dream world is unmatchable in any recent films.I thought of ""The Matrix,"" and even Leo's latest (excellent) work ""Shutter Island,"" as this film proceeds to disorient you about what is and is not reality. However, ""Inception"" goes several levels higher in the hierarchy of convolutions in film. There are at least four levels of simultaneous dream upon dream happening at one time at one point. Amazing film editing work!Then there are technical aspects which were mind-boggling indeed, as Nolan's bizarre script required. The audience is brought inside buildings, rooms, elevators, even entire cities where you lose the sense of space, time, gravity and logic. It is a dream world--you need to see it to fully appreciate what I just wrote. The musical score of Hans Zimmer was strong and dramatic. These are definitely contenders by Oscar time.This film is not for everyone. There are those who would dismiss this as impossibly pretentious and pointless. But for me, ""Inception"" was very stimulating and challenging -- a film well-worthy to spend two and a half hours of our valuable time. Be ready to face this challenge when you go watch it. I won't be surprised if you feel you need to watch it all over again."
119173,False,"i might be in the minority here but i was not blown away by this film.don't get me wrong.i enjoyed,ans it's well made,and has an interesting concept(the art of stealing a person's secrets from their subconscious while they are dreaming.but to me,it didn't(or couldn't) live up to the hype.it has its good point.it isn't boring and the acting is first rate,especially by Leonardo DiCaprio.i liked the look of the film too.many people i know have said it was so complex that they had to watch it more than once to understand it.i don't agree.i didn't find it complex at all.think it's well worth watching,but like i said,It just had too much hype to live up to.but that's just me opinion.for me,Inception is a 7/10"
119174,False,"If you must watch this caper then I would recommend you watch it as if you were watching a comedy. At least then its tolerable. As you watch just imagine the delirious brainwashed mind salivating at the infantile plot. Titter away at the scenes and dialogue they perceive as intellectually gigantic (easy to spot). Guffaw at the endless streaming dialogue intended to inform their low IQ brain what's going on (otherwise they wouldn't have a clue, guaranteed) I have no complaints about the acting or the production in general. I do however have to complain about the annoying score which was terribly loud. At times it was so loud it was actually painful in the mid range."
119175,False,"First of all, a pet peeve of mine is to read reviews that give away more about a movie than they should. I will not do this here.At the time of the writing of this review, IMDb's overall or average user rating was 9.1. This is most likely among the highest of all movies ever reviewed on this site.Before I paid theater prices (which are just generally too high) to see this film on or shortly after its opening weekend, I checked the user reviews posted here; which I remember as being very positive then, as well.Much is made, in many of the reviews, about the plot twists and plot layers. It is true that the film contains deep plot layering and a few sharp twists, along with some pretty cool CG and 'slow-mo' animations.The problem is that these are essentially all that the movie has going for it.The underlying plot is not compelling. It is comprised, ultimately and fundamentally, of a science fiction technique for one or more trained people to enter the dreams of another, after all involved go to sleep. Each person involved in the 'dream-walking' process, including the person whose dream the others are entering, must have some idea, before sleeping, of what is about to happen. There are briefcase-sized machines involved which must be hooked up to every person who wishes to 'share' the dream. (None of this spoils any of the plot's fulcrums; this is all simply underlying premise, those things on which the plot fulcrums depend.) The above premise is the only original idea of the film. After that, it's just another action movie with a little bit of psychology thrown in. It attempts to be a psychological thriller, but it's more of a psychological action film. The basic premise is not compelling; and the plot twists and layers, which are supposed to be the parts of the movie which 'wow' viewers (and which most of the reviews actually seem to be impressed with), are neither all that original nor imaginative. The ideas behind the layers and twists are fairly commonplace, considering many thriller or psychological type films that have been made and released over the past few decades.Christopher Nolan has, in my opinion, through films made prior to ""Inception"", made a place for himself among the more original and capable film directors. The first movie of his that I saw was ""Memento"". I think the only others of his that I have seen (before ""Inception"") were ""Batman Begins"", ""The Prestige"", and ""The Dark Knight"". Each of these is a very good - or great - movie.""Memento"" gives viewers a fair idea of the kind of plot layering and twisting that Nolan is trying to accomplish in ""Inception"". ""Memento"" uses a rather original and compelling storytelling device. Upon this the film rests, and upon this the film succeeds.The plot of ""Inception"" rests upon this technique for entering dreams. This is not that compelling; and the ideas, layers, and twists placed upon this premise are not enough to pull it into the land of storytelling greatness of ""Memento"". They are not enough to give it the appeal or draw of the plot of the great ""The Dark Knight"", which constantly had viewers concerned for the citizens of its setting; and which caused viewers to always wonder what horrible, deadly scheme the story's antagonist was going to pull the protagonist into.""Inception"" is a movie that is no better than most other action movies with a psychological bent. The layers DO require a person to devote full attention to follow. The many plot elements also call for viewers to have a modicum of intelligence or a bit of learning in psychological or consciousness theory. Without these things, a viewer will not truly appreciate what is going on, and will be left to trying to enjoy the action and special effects.Perhaps because it demands viewers' attention and thought, the movie is better than most products from Hollywood. I suspect that it is due to these demands of the film that it has been rated so highly by so many IMDb reviewers. It must be better than at least 60 or 70 percent of Hollywood's garbage - most of which which I have deliberately missed, and against which I am mostly unable to compare ""Inception""; but that doesn't make it a great or ""perfect"" film.In this way, the movie is almost certainly better than MOST Hollywood products. However, likely due to their points of comparison, IMDb reviewers have provided this film with a rating that is so high as to be inaccurate and misleading. It is, in the broadest land of Hollywood, above average. It is NOT good or great, or anything above those levels.Save your money and DO NOT watch this at a full-price theater, unless you're just so steeped in material possession that you simply don't care about $8-10 or more per ticket. It is much easier to appreciate this movie as part of a Netflix queue, or at the cost of a Redbox rental - especially with a setup that will do full justice to some of the cool CG ... though, frankly, pretty much everything from Hollywood is full of cool CG these days.Ultimately, Nolan will be remembered for ""The Dark Knight"", ""Memento"", and perhaps for future films; but not for ""Inception"". Over time, ""Inception"" will fall from the minds of film viewers, though it seems to hold a place at the forefront right now. Hopefully, he returns to form. I expect him to."
119176,False,"What is Inception? It's a sci-fi movie with a little bit of a moral to it. But it's mostly just sci-fi. It has a plot, but the plot takes over an hour just to present itself. And it has a good ending, which takes place about 1 and 1/2 hours after that. In between those times you'll be bombarded with so much sci-fi that you'll think you're in a college class. You won't be able to see the forest through the trees. This is a bland movie, lacking a gravitas and a human element. Stylistically it was interesting. It had kind of a film-noir feel to it. But that was grossly outweighed by the enormous amount of sci-fi. It was also kind of disturbing. The only character I thought was likable was the son of a captain of industry. It seems like most of the characters didn't even like each other, and those that did were in unhealthy, and even sick relationships. They say the love you get is equal to the love you give. There's not much love in this film, except for the captain of industry's love for his father. Many of the characters don't even respect each other. I was so bored I wanted to walk out early. It was a good ending, but I'm just not a huge sci-fi geek."
119177,False,"Inception indeed sports a stellar cast and its ratings have been an unqualified success. However, in spite of such commendations, this film is at best mediocre. It reeks of the residue of the Matrix and has elements of other much-loved dream caper films such as the Nightmare on Elm Street series of yesteryear.The special effects are mind-blowing, the acting is par excellence, but the concept itself - rather than being sublime, is in fact nothing spectacular at all. The gist of it is that Di Caprio's character is able to enter the minds and dreams of his subjects. He plants seeds to uncover data and everyone becomes interlocked in the same dream, with surprising twists and turns.The twist in the film - let's leave that to the audience to uncover - is hardly worth the running time of the film and what it promises in terms of high-impact mind-blowing content falls short of films like The Sixth Sense and Fight Club. Overall, it's nothing more than a high-tech visual extravaganza of spectacular stunts and a seemingly LSD-induced storyline."
119178,False,"I went to see Inception ready to see another Memento. Other reviews made me believe that Inception is thought-provoking, intelligent, and that viewing it requires constant attention. What I ended up viewing was a movie with a decent and interesting plot-line, but with nothing to stir my mind.I think the main reason people think Inception is intelligent are lots of rules about dreaming that are at times a bit difficult to keep up with. The difficulty in keeping up with the rules lies in their great number - not in their complexity or innovation. All those rules are completely arbitrary, they don't stem from anything, cannot be reached through reasoning and they form no grand picture. You can dream within a dream. Time passes more slowly the deeper you go in a dream. Changing your appearance is apparently a special skill in a dream... It's logistics are a mess. If Nolan decided to go with different rules, they would still make the same amount of sense. Most of the rules feel very contrived, their only purpose to push the plot forward or to add to the sense of action. E.g. Security gets tighter as you go deeper into a dream. Of course - you need to have more action as the apex of the movie nears.Dreams as presented in this movie have nothing to do with real dreams. Even aside from the contrived rules, they are way too orderly and sensible. So I don't get how anyone can feel thought-provoked by what is obviously fiction. Sure, one can be amazed with the idea that we're living in The Matrix, because for all we know, it might be true. One can also be amazed at the aspects of a work of fiction that pertain to reality. But how one can find a presentation of dreams that we already know is incorrect mindblowing is beyond me.Perhaps people are fascinated with the idea that what we see may not be reality. But seriously, have you never questioned your sense of reality before seeing this movie? When people say they're thought-provoked, I think they're confusing their thoughts with their feelings. The movie has an air of mystery, and viewers will get a sense of discovery as they became acquainted with the option of entering other people's dreams. Yet those are feelings. What exactly is there to ponder about? Hordes of reviewers say that they were left thinking, but few of them share with us specific thoughts they had.Inception is actually a good movie. I liked a lot of scenes, and everyone played their parts well. It's just that it's not what it aims to be: revolutionary and thought-provoking."
119179,False,"Ugh, where to begin? This is without doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I know I stand pretty alone in saying this, everyone else loves it at the moment. I just guess I'm no fan of surrealist art, and don't get me wrong - this is, if there ever was, a surrealist moving picture. It's like watching James Bond while you're high. Y'know, James Bond in the sky with diamonds? I guess that doesn't really work though.I don't know why this film has my dislike. It has good actors, good jokes and very visually stunning sets. Yes, I know what it's about. Yes, it's mostly in a dream. Or, a while in, In a dream of a dream of a dream of a dream. Yes I get the whole time thing. 5 minutes in Inception equals 1 hour in reality. Yes I know because it's set in a dream world this gives it license to do surreal things that would happen in a dream.Stuff it, call me simple but after so long of a Soundtrack that sounds like a stuck record, landscapes filled with surrealist artwork, people I can barely hear speak, Jokes that seem out of place and just plain weird weirdness AND ON TOP OF THAT a story that I didn't pick up interest on when the movie started and I most certainly did not by the time it finished - it all just seemed like white blur. The snow didn't help much either.To be completely honest I just sat through a movie that most now regard a masterpiece and was bored out of my skull. When I left I felt horrible and tense and unsure as to whether or not I just watched anything at all. I guess it just all blurred together, won't be seeing that again if I can help it.1/10"
119180,False,"Upon reviewing the ""Dark knight"" I had said that a director such as Nolan was being wasted in Batman sequels, regardless of their quality. And that was because Nolan is one the few directors in Hollywood able to create something truly original and as such should not be adding branches to fully grown trees.""Inception"" proves the validity of my claim, but it does so in ways that surprised me.Perhaps the most immediate distinction between ""Inception"" and the ""Dark Knight"" is an improved sense of pacing. It doesn't feel like narrative put in a blender like the batman movie did: despite its scope, each scene is warranted plenty of time and the use of more traditional associative cuts allow it to flow better.The movie itself is difficult to describe,which is a non-issue because it requires itself to be experienced to be understood.Another area Nolan seems to be grasping is in directing actors: I always liked Leonardo DiCaprio, but his mannerisms at times can be the thing obstructing a good actor from becoming great. In ""Inception"", all his mannerisms are gone and this is finest performance ever.The special effects are incredibly well done, which means they don't look like CGI, even when they are. However, one of its greatest technical achievements is the sound editing, perfectly balancing the several momentums of the scenes.Wishing to provide no spoilers at all, I'll just say it isn't nearly as complicated as some have named it, but it is a complex concept.I cannot compliment this movie enough. It is the most engaging film experience I have had in a long, long, long time. My advice is don't miss it in the theaters. Don't miss it when it come to DVD. Don't miss it any chance you get.You won't regret it."
119181,False,"Its been a couple of hours since I watched this new movie by Christopher Nolan. After watching Memento,Batman Begins and Dark Knight, I was quite confident that this would be a memorable experience. Also the expectations were rising high and I knew that it got good reviews, still I was able to shut myself from all of them and see the movie fresh.I would rather say that I was blown away with the plot. Its something one has never imagined of. The whole movie was so exciting and blink-and-you-will-miss type that you will have to see it again or rethink it again and again to grasp the total plot, just like 'Memento'. I was always fond of Nolan's movie background sounds as it keeps you at the edge of your seat.Now comes the acting part. Caprio was excellent, well accompanied by Joseph Gordon Levitt and Ellen Page and others. But I would rather say that the actors didn't got much chance to do anything. They did exactly what the script demanded.The direction was top notch along with the breathtaking visuals and locations. Especially the dream scenes. As for the academy awards, I expect this film to grab the prize in direction,screenplay,sound mixing,sound editing and visual effects and may also the best picture(not quite sure after watching Toy Story 3 few weeks back).Anyway, for the people who are reading this review before going to see it, I would advise that, this would blow your mind. A must see in my opinion because very few movies have a captivating plot and superb direction like this one. Its an epic, go for it."
119182,False,"The plot is like a Japanese anime named Paprika ??? So what ???I don't care. Who watch anime anyway ? What's really great about this movie is that ... it's mass appealing ... it's visually beautiful and it's one of only a few blockbusters (especially sci-fi movies) that will stay into your mind for a while.It's a smart movie and the plot is not overcomplicated.The cast did a great acting job. I really love Leo, Michael Caine and Cilian Murphy's performance.My review doesn't need to be too long. Just go see it.I think this is going to become an instant classic.Can't wait for the next Nolan movie."
119183,False,"My mind is aching(!!!) I have just seen the movie and I really liked it. I went to cinema with 8 other people and all of them were satisfied. After Avatar I was very disappointed about cinema. But Inception showed that brilliant ideas still exist and it shows that how can you apply visual effects to tell a story not just to show off! It has something new to offer. I'm not a fan of science fiction movies, specially ones with strange creatures. What makes me to like Inception this much is the fact that it picks one real thing, something we encounter every day, our dreams, and takes us to the unknown world of dreaming. I loved Matrix at it's time and I'm loving Inception. It feels more real than every other Sci-Fiction movie I have ever seen. Worth watching, absolutely recommendable!"
119184,False,"I always type my reviews in Notepad, but no  Inception deserves better. After a run of the most amazing films ever  Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, The Prestige, and of course, The Dark Knight (my all time favourite!), Nolan is finally ready with his next experiment: Inception, a dream-come-true movie (which is kind of ironic!) that makes us question the existence of the very world around us. One assumed that The Dark Knight was the ultimate peak that any film maker could ever reach  Nolan included  but this young director refuses to accept that there is a Cloud 9  and simply questions, ""What next?"" And BANG answers it himself: Inception. My new all-time favourite.The English Dictionary defines ""inception"" as ""origin""  basically, that is what the film is about. It's about planting an idea in someone's mind, hence, ""originating"" an idea in that person. It's the most amazing experiment anyone has ever performed: an impossible world where you enter dreams, and dreams within dreams, and dreams within those, until you realize that such a movie is only ever found in dreams, except that Nolan doesn't think so.Nolan uses his incredible direction skills in this movie to make it the wonder it is. His direction is what makes this film tick. His timing is just amazing. Caprio does full justice to his character, Cobb. Zimmer's music keeps us with Nolan's pace, which is why it all turns out to be so incredible. The cinematography, superb, the special effects, superb, the editing, perfect, the script, brilliant. This movie has everything!But then the only question that people are asking now is  which one is it  The Dark Knight, or Inception? I'll be blunt honest. The reason Memento didn't work as well as TDK, despite being an amazing film, is that it wasn't a film for everyone. Only those people who're willing to take the weight, the tension, and those who have a high presence of mind, and an understanding of the complexity of a highly complex film will be able to fully enjoy the film. Inception pushes TDK aside with ease, but not for the entire world. If one has noticed, then you can see that Nolan is following an alternative pattern in all his films that have made it to the Top IMDb 250: Memento, highly complex, Batman Begins, not so, Prestige, complex again, The Dark Knight, not so, and now Inception, his most incredible project.I immediately called up people after the movie, telling them to go watch it, and I was shocked beyond anything when one of the friends said, ""I'm going for Eclipse. Can't."" Learn your lesson, people, do NOT miss this wonder. Like Toy Story, this too comes once in a decade. Though in Nolan's case, that's not true. Trust Nolan. Now, I can't wait for Batman 3.10/10. Damn! Isn't there anything more than that?"
119185,False,"My wife and I went to this movie with high expectations. Unfortunately, I relied too heavily on the critics and IMDb's rating. The acting was good which would normally mean a higher rating, but I disliked this movie so much, I couldn't give it higher than one star.The theory of the movie is complicated and, I believe, not well explained. By the end, which I thought would never come, I felt I understood the basics but not much more (maybe my wife and I are just to dumb to grasp the intricacies).Some of the special effects were excellent, but for the most part they went on way to long. A good editing job could have eliminate enough to get the film below 2 hours. Many of the action scenes in the snow could have been eliminated altogetherMy wife and I are retired and go to a lot of movies. We thoroughly enjoyed Knight and Day which has only grossed $70 million but avoided like the plague the newer movie Grown Ups which has already grossed over $130 million. It's unfortunate, but stupid is in.When you see so many movies like we do your requirements may be higher. I want a reasonably good story, good acting, and a entertaining experience. We loved Hangover, Kick-Ass, and Toy Story 3. There was quality and entertainment in each. Except for the special effects, I can't say the same about Inception."
119186,False,"Could this possibly be the same Christopher Nolan that gave us the classic ""Dark Knight""? What a letdown! What a sleep inducing, pretentious, rip off this mess was. Even with the obvious attempt by Nolan to instill a sense of sophistication with his use of high Brahman pseudo scientific dialog, it still couldn't save this bow-wow of a film, the script must have been written by somnambulist. If the producers of Inception would have changed all the high brow dialog and spoken plain English it still wouldn't have made any sense. I was almost snoring and in my own dream state of Inception after sitting through what seemed to be the whole first half of the movie, listening to Leonardo Di Caprio keep describing how the whole Inception theory worked, wake me up when it's over! Then when ""Cobb"" (LDC), goes to his angry Father In Law for assistance he gets a young college student as an assistant, Say Whaaat! The scenes concerning Cobbs dream life with his dead wife (Marion Cotillard) were beside the point and, or better yet there was no point. Those special effects that Cobb shared with his assistant, the college girl, were just unimaginative and boring, buildings folding up and turning upside down, huh? what's the appeal in that? And we keep reading about the new boy wonder replacement for the brilliant Heath Ledger, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, are you kidding? This scrawny pencil neck could never walk in Heath Ledgers shoes! Actually none of the actors in this movie instilled any emotion or gave any credibility to their characters, they were syrupy and one-dimensional.Also the too loud, obnoxious, Wagnerian like, music score was driving me to grind my teeth and wish for drink by the time the movie finally ended, and it was still blasting away as we escaped this torment and hit the exit. No matter how loud, heroic, and operatic the music score it still couldn't save this dog of a movie. Great science fiction movies would be on the level of ""Blade Runner, Alien, District 9, Predator, even Avatar, this attempt at that genre fell flat on it's face, it was too long, boring, and narcissistic. I feel more suspense and get more action when fishing, I'm 64 years old and have been watching movies all my life, I can't remember watching a more pretentious, precious, and sleep inducing attempt at a movie. Batman couldn't save this film."
119187,False,"Writer-director Christopher Nolan's byzantine puzzle-movie ""Inception"" is so fully engulfed in a surreal sort of Raison d'être--while also managing to introduce a new set of rules to us, though not appearing to abide by those rules near the finale--it's easy to understand why some audiences are embracing the film as a masterpiece. These days, if a film is complexly-layered it is automatically deemed art...not popcorn entertainment ready for mass consumption, but high art. If ""small minds"" are unable to grasp the film's deeper meanings, those poor folks are disregarded as unworthy participants in the ultimate game. ""Inception"" is a game--and, at times, a grand one--but it isn't a masterpiece. It's a gun-crazy, gadget-mad, hyperactive Rubik's Cube of a movie. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the grieving Cobb, a dream extractor who enters into the sleeping minds of others to gather vital information which cannot be obtained any other way. Unfortunately, memories of his late wife (and guilt over her mysterious death) are so vivid they are permeating Cobb's subconscious; and inevitably those haunted images follow him helplessly on his jaunts into the dream-state. The movie has very little exposition, with a confusing prologue later revealed to be the starter threads to the epilogue, and doesn't really get going until we are introduced to Cobb's latest case involving a dying billionaire, his crestfallen son, and the final draft of the tycoon's will which is locked up in a safe no one knows the combination to. The other participants in the project are a brainy, adept, and engaging group of people we become quite fond of; often times, particularly in a perplexing movie such as this one, having such smart, savvy characters populating the scenario makes the ride that much more enjoyable (not forgetting of course that humans are never so vulnerable to danger as when they are asleep). What doesn't really work are the constant sniper attacks in the dreams--projections which manifest themselves as an angry militia--as well as a visual impersonation of the son's godfather, which is necessary to the plot but becomes little more than a complicated footnote. The level of dreams our heroes pass through, one more dangerous than the last, provide the picture with a visual kick, and the nonchalant manner in which the characters respond to their strange new surroundings accent ""Inception"" with a giddiness not usually found in big-budget action films. I'm not sure whether or not Christopher Nolan violates his own movie-rules in order to cap the film with an emotional bow, but he does get solid performances from his cast, a rich and delectable production design from his art department, and swirling, hallucinogenic special effects from his creative team. Is the movie a mind-blowing experience? For many audiences, it certainly will be. As with all 'summer epics' and popcorn crowd-pleasers, this one's crazy glow will probably fade in the stretch (I can't imagine the film will hold up so well once it goes the home-video route--it's a theatrical experience, after all). It is not a work of art, however that doesn't mean it isn't sheer pleasure from start to finish. *** from ****"
119188,False,"In Chris Nolan's films, the narrative (and not anything else) is the main character, the center around which all else assembles. In terms of narrative complexity, this film doesn't really hold a candle to what 'Memento' and 'The Prestige' (or even 'Following') gave the viewer. The narration is linear, and the story ultimately harbors no mysteries. None at all. My guess is that all potential complexities were ironed out in order to secure finance and avoid risk. Even the human drama is totally unengaging and non-complex. This film doesn't give the viewer anything non-filmic to think about. Its a decent thrill ride, albeit with a new concept.The ""money idea"" here is the notion of nesting dreams within dreams in a potentially infinite sequence, like a Russian doll. This part of the film is really done well, and I'm sure everyone must hold their breath at the moment when all four (five?) levels ""synchronize"" and the ""kick"" is transmitted top to bottom.I suppose Nolan and his group must get credit simply for attempting something like this. Unfortunately there are problems here. The biggest one is how the dreams are constructed. They are mere action set-pieces. This is certainly not how we dream, not at all. Even allowing that, the dull and careless way in which the film is shot and edited is jarring. Worse, all the different levels are shot in the same visual style; there is no way to distinguish a dream state from reality, even when the viewer knows its a dream. Compare this with Martin Scorsese's use of two distinct visual palettes in 'Shutter Island' : one was surreal, and one prosaic; to denote two different states of mind. 'Fight Club' and 'Matrix' come to mind too.Nolan prefers an extremely wordy exposition over showing things visually. He expects viewers to understand concepts like the ""unconscious"", when truly speaking, few understand it well. Everyone has heard the word; how many people have studied it as a psychoanalytic concept proper ?? Even the particular interpretation that the unconscious and lucid dreaming are given, it is all just way too literal.With all due respect, someone needs to tell Chris Nolan to allow the use of second units. I'm sorry, but it seems he just cant shoot a decent action sequence to save his life. I'm surprised how no one has pointed this out.'Inception' was financed for one reason, and one reason only. Think of the amount of money that Batman 3 will make, if only they can get Nolan on board. It will obliterate any losses that 'Inception' may make."
119189,False,"Inception is the new sci-fi movie that has taken America and Britain by storm. In the US alone on it's first weekend of release, it engrossed a staggering $60.4 million dollars and is currently top of the box office around the world. This movie has been hyped up beyond anything I have ever known in magnitude. Plenty of friends I know in America informed me of the same adjectives used to describe this movie ""incredible"" ""unbelivable"" ""terrfic"" and common phrases associated with it like ""Christopher Nolan is a god film-maker"" and with the film in general ""the best film ever"" etc. Usually I typically associate these adjectives and ""the best film ever"" phrase with a lot of movies I have had the pleasure of viewing over the years. But to describe it with the adjectives listed above is an understatement. There are no words that can reiterate how this film is. Just using all the adjectives to describe something you like will have to do. Usually when a film like Inception is hyped, I get swarmed along with it. You just cannot help it, it's like the institution of cinema has an overwhelming attraction to you that you give in to see films like Inception. I would certainly rate Inception in terms of how amazing it is up there with Titanic, Avatar and The Lord of the Rings trilogies.Christopher Nolan, I knew nothing of his work before he reinvigorated the Batman franchise. With Batman Begins he did this very well but the Dark Knight as those who will know have looked at my review on it, I found it bitterly disappointing to say the least though I was the minority in arguing this. But most directors have their successes and failures and after Inception Nolan truly deserves to join the other Hollywood King of directors like James Cameron, Steven Spielburg, Clint Eastwood and Peter Jackson. This is Nolan's masterpiece.To start the basic story is that Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCapario) a highly skilled thief at extracting ideas from an individual's subconscious whilst they are dreaming is a fugitive after he lost everything he loved and is given the chance to go back to his children if he pulls off one last heist of implanting an idea in Robert Fischer's mind (Cillian Murphy) to bring down an empire run originally by his dad. Cobb ensembles a team of experts, which includes an architect that designs the world of the dream, Ariadne (Ellen Juno) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon Levitt). The idea to bring the empire down is to pull off Inception, a supposed impossible dream system, which involves creating a dream within a dream within a dream, basically three dream layers, which is impossible to maintain before the dreamer wakes up in real state. Meanwhile a back story that does though come into conjunction with the main plot later on is Cobb's visions of seeing his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) where his memories of her interrupt the dream state. Watch as events unfold before you as from the first scene, this is truly a movie you need both your eyes, ears and mind to see. It is stunning visually as the idea of controlling one dreams with different layout's and shapes takes effect. Never has architecture seem so fascinating. Watching it is like art, creative, textured and multi-layered exactly like a dream. Trying to make your brain function at trying to understand the complexity of the multi-layered dreams in the story is simplified, but you have to pay attention. This film is literally perfect. The acting from DiCaprio is brilliant and just like the excellent Shutter Island, he deserves an Oscar nomination. Terrific support comes from Murphy, Juno, Levitt and Cotillard who flex out their roles and make the most of it. Sir Micheal Caine gives a superb tiny cameo of only being on the screen for a few minutes.Nolan appreciates that story and character and plot development is as important as visual style and action, with the action being plenty of and choreographed incredibly making it terrifically exciting. Each character has depth particularly Cobb and there are extremely inventive camera shots and angles that Nolan uses with a gorgeous cinematography, a stunning music score and a cracking ending that leaves you to draw your own conclusions. It reminds me of Mulholland Drive with dreams and reality.Nolan has created a movie that will have impact on every film maker to come and Inception will become a classic. Film enthusiasts and critics will be analysing this for years. Truly a remarkable and stupendous achievement for Nolan who has come up with an original and refreshing story idea. All film departments perform immaculately like a well oiled machine and I wouldn't bet for me on this being the best film of the year for me. The 9.3 of the IMDb rating is well justified. It's two and half hours this film, but they fly by. One of the greatest and surely iconic and influential film's of our time in over a hundred years of cinema. I can't give it more praise than that except to say I loved Inception!"
119190,False,"I checked engraved my euro, I'm awake, it's true I'm sitting in a chair watching this movie. I'cant escape, I have to wait for the end. A good idea, fine actors, explosions, exotic locations, and special effects put them in a bag,mix them and this case you don't get a movie. There is no plot or scenario when the writers or director did get stacked, it was very easy: it's a dream. I thought the film was all about the manipulation of the brain and effect on human behavior. But after 30 minutes I was looking at ordinary action film with people shooting but not did get hurt, buildings that erased, turned or collapsed. The whole universe in this film looked like a comic book, only cardboard characters. Instead of seeing this movie, take a nap and make you own dream."
119191,False,"Im sort of sick of people saying this movie is ""confusing"" or has ""many twists"". it doesn't. the concept is extremely simple. go inside a dream and keep dreaming in dreams until u reach a point where the victim is vulnerable enough for inception (the act of planting an idea). thats it, its that easy. now that thats covered, the movie is fresh in the sense that well everything occurs in a dream so u can do anything u want without essentially dealing with real life consequences. this is both the good part and the bad part of the movie. Christopher Nolan is a clever man. the concept of a state of mind where reality seems to be yet with no real life consequences is extremely appealing to humans which may distract many from the flaws in the movie. Christopher new that, and its also what he wanted. But he also new that some people had working brains and could see past this illusion, so he had to have an end game, a consequence at some point, and thats when he put in the FAIL of the movie. it was then said that if u die in a dream under sedation u will stay locked in a prison dream world where u cant escape all because u died. he called this limbo. let us remember that in a dream we are imagining. so right now if i took an ambien and imagine jumping off a cliff, i would be stuck in a parallel universe for 100 years. there's a difference between sci-fi and ridiculous, and then there's inception. whats even more annoying is that half of the movie is spent trying to make this whole concept seem real. overall very average movie that stumbles over itself over and over until we perceive these stumblings as an innovative twist and deem this average movie genius."
119192,False,"I really wanted to like this morning but it was the first one since Mr Magoo that I have felt like walking out of! I had a feeling of having seen it all before during this movie - I was constantly thinking of Robin Williams in What Dreams May Come where his wife is trapped in purgatory and also Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. By the end we were all waiting for it to end in my group and comments when filing out of the cinema in Australia were much the same from the rest of the crowd. It actually feels like a nightmare which I guess is what the director intended. On the upside it had a fantastic all star cast but they struggled to make this mess coherent. Cillian Murphy - still waiting to hit the Hollywood big time he deserves - tried his best with his limited script but he really needs a better part than this. The music was quite jarring all the way through, and sounds near identical to DiCaprio's last movie; the much better Shutter Island. The constant strings with trumpet bellows are meant to add tension, but after you hear the same sequence of music for over two hours it gets a little annoying to say the least. I am sorry; I wanted to love it but it ended up being baffling by the plot and painfully boring to watch."
119193,False,"To describe Inception in a single adjective will never be enough. The sheer magnitude at which this movie happens is simply exceptional. It could've only been pulled off by someone as good as Chris Nolan. I can go on and on about praising this movie was hours, that's months in dream level one and years in dream level two. :)Put it simply, this is the best movie I've watched in my life because of it's idea, it's execution and it's emotional depth. People always moan about Nolan's movies not being emotional, but this one is definitely not one of them. You will feel for Cobb and Mal. Di Caprio has done a terrific job showing the vulnerabilities and guilt of Cobb. Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon Levitt have given neat performances. Tom Hardy was simply brilliant in the way he handled Eames. Cilian, as usual has done job well. The rest of the cast have done a good job as well. The cinematography by Wally Pfister is one of the best in recent times. Hans Zimmer's music is haunting. Editing by Lee Smith is top notch. But this film truly belongs to Nolan. From the storyline to it's execution, Nolan oozes confidence in every department. Be it narration, bringing awe-striking visuals or keeping us on the edge of our seats, he has truly demonstrated that he's not only one of the most entertaining, but one of the most intelligent directors in world cinema today. For that, take a bow Nolan!"
119194,False,"Just when u think that Chris. Nolan cant come up with a movie of the same league as the dark knight, he comes up with inception. 148 mins of pure genius. an instant classic. it is well on its way to be the movie of the decade or maybe even more. From start to finish this movie just holds your attention and you witness something that u cant even dream of.Every single thing in the movie seems to be picture perfect, each and every character has been well portrayed and justified in its own way.The only problem i had was that i didn't want the movie to get over, i just wanted to be a part of his dream world. to conclude i would just say that Chris Nolan is on his way to be recognized as one of the very best the world has ever seen."
119195,False,"A movie is not only about ideas, but the way in which it is delivered and this piece is living proof. Christopher Nolan personifies the idea that every one of us has experienced at some level in the form of dreams and creates an unprecedented and mind-numbing story. The human mind is so dynamic and creative that when uninhibited can create powerful alternate realities in the form of dreams.This dream draws its details from memories, logic and most importantly ideas that can shape every perceivable outcome. The story hinges on the perception that ideas are resilient parasites which when implanted in the brain, grows indiscriminately like a tumor and can supplant commonly held beliefs and force the dreamer into revealing personal details to the supplanter/extractor called ""Inception"". Leonardo DiCaprio (Cobb) plays the part of a world's best extractor who gets a contract from a powerful executive to perform inception. This is insignificant, as the real story is about Cobb (DiCaprio) and his personal journey into becoming the thief he is now. Everything else that is shown portends the complexity of his past that has been a melting pot of love, hate, loss, regret and anger. In fact at the end of the movie I completely forgot the cast of characters other than DiCaprio and rightly so because of the significance placed on the life of Cobb. Christopher Nolan uses the most compelling images in the form of special effects and a layered, interconnected plot that challenges your mind to think unconventionally. I realized that most of the negative reviews results from a poor understanding of the underlying theme and the inability to make out the fast paced changes that occur in the movie. But it's not that complicated and as described in this review, has very few underlying thematic points. Just sit back and enjoy the mind shattering experience of understanding what dreams are all about."
119196,False,"This is one movie where you can write a review and there is very less chance that it would contain spoilers. There is so much in the movie, that it cannot be revealed in a single short review. All I can say is that it is one of the must watch movies ever, especially for those who like intense movies: the types which require the viewer to stay focused throughout. Everything about the movie is near perfect. The story (the writing deserves a special mention), the direction and the performances especially from Leo everything contribute in making the movie thoroughly enjoyable. The reason I have given a 9 instead of 10 is that for some reason I could not continue thinking a lot about the movie once I came out of it. There are a lot of movies which stay with you for a long time after you watch it, and they go on to be termed ""great"". This for some reason didn't do that, but I seriously enjoyed it as long as it lasted, with no dull moment, and I would recommend it to everyone. This is Nolan's best so far, and I hope he continues outdoing himself. And he is definitely my favourite director now!"
119197,False,"Frankly, I don't see how all these people vote for 8. Inception is such a claustrophobic and overwhelming movie. The whole movie is extremely boring and isn't containing any funny moment. Yes, we are all know that this is not a comic. But the movie is going so serious when there's nothing to be serious about.""A dream within a dream,"" may look like an interesting subject. However, we see that Nolan couldn't handle the subject very well. We can confirm that. Dialogues are cliché, simple and dysfunctional. Obviously, film was made for simple audience.This is so sad. Inception is a stain on Top 250 list."
119198,False,"Boy i must be very shallow because i found this film one of the most boring films ever! The trailer was pretty good but the movie...not so good..I saw it and i fell asleep,i first fell asleep when that van was falling...i woke up, i even saw a little dream but that van was still falling and i thought to my self..what the hell is happening here?Is this a dream or a nightmare?I see all that reviews saying what a masterpiece this film was..blah blah... and the rating??wow..someone is being generous..So my opinion for this is that if you have trouble sleeping hit this film,it will come so natural you won't know what hit you..I know i am a bad reviewer but this is the truth and nothing but the true in this case..SORRY my opinion"
119199,False,"hi as ever when you start writing here its because you have had a strong reaction one way or another. the strong reaction here is that the film gets a 9 out of 10 rating and this is way way too high. the film uses the Freudian idea of the mind as having depth, multi layered and having defenses he uses this idea to create an action film. the idea of defense means that the director spends literally long periods of the film with people shooting each other as the defense attacks the people coming into the mind. as a result this is a one dimensional look at dreams, so its James bond meets psychology...it really doesn't work.....don't believe the hypethanks will & vero"
119200,False,"Inception,definitely is a good film.But not at all one of the best films ever.Everyone who watched this movie will feel the genius,brilliance,excellence etc..,of the director Nolan.(Believe me..Most of them thought themselves a Genius because they understood this film !!)If that is the only criteria required,then scientists of NASA can be the top directors in Hollywood.This movie is like a puzzle(i mean ""satisfaction-both sides"") category.I don't know if there is a genre called ""puzzle"",for which smart fellows(""let them assume"") can give a total 10 for this kind of movie.Really it doesn't belong to top #250 category at all..(At present,I am really hating this movie just because it is above Schindler's List)"
119201,False,"Strong performances across the board, from Christopher Nolan's direction, to the actors, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt shines...there are LOTS OF EXPLANATIONS...how the dream levels work, expansion of time, construction of dreamscapes, yadda yadda yadda...the effects are top notch but I'm not much of a fan of ""dream"" movies...something weird happens and someone wakes up...and then I'll realize that ""oh yeah....the guy was just having a dream...."" ...and Bobby Ewing WASN'T REALLY KILLED !....grrrrr ......read ""deus ex machina"".....all in all it was pretty good, though....and I'll rent it and see it again just to enjoy the enjoyable aspects of it....but I DON'T agree that it is the masterpiece that it has been rated to be.....So I woke up this morning and wondered if I had really gone to the movies last night to see ""Inception""...and I firmly grabbed hold of my favorite little toy and realized that I WAS awake and I HAD NOT really seen it....but then, I REALLY woke up and realized that I had........MAYBE....."
119202,False,"I'm the type of guy who usually loves this type of sci-fi movie with far-out concepts, especially if it involves dreams. After finally being able to watch Inception, I must admit I fall somewhere ""in-between"" in my appreciation of this film. In-between best movie ever and horrible illogical mess but strongly leaning towards the positive side. The trailer, for once, doesn't tell you much but certainly wets your appetite. Avoiding spoilers, ""Inception"" refers to the concept of planting an idea deep into the subconscious of a person through dreams. A team of specialists usually extract secret informations from minds but doing an ""inception"" is much riskier because apparently people always know where they get their ideas from (really ?!). While the ""architect"" of the team builds a believable landscape (so the dreamer doesn't notice he's dreaming), the others infiltrate and try to influence the dreamer for their own purposes. You would expect flights of fancy and crazy visuals from dreams but it's fairly restrained here (except for the training of a new architect and one of the ending dream layers with crumbling buildings). It is explained by the fact that the dream must remain realistic to the target otherwise projections of his subconscious will attack the intruders and/or he will realize he is dreaming.So despite the fact I would have enjoyed more imagination in the dreamscapes (as hinted at in the wondrous architect's training), I understand why they were fairly normal. I could not help but feel a bit disappointed by that though. The action scenes were frenetic and exciting with particular praise going to the anti-gravity fight scene in the hotel. This is a great anthology moment if I ever saw one. Cinematographically, this is great with director Nolan going from spectacular bird's eye city views to closed-in face shots to show the emotions with a whole variety of angles between the extremes. The shooting is masterful. We're never really lost in the action except perhaps when the characters look too much alike in the snowy dream layer. Speaking of which, this part felt very much like a James Bond movie and I kept thinking the ""hero"" was too good to be true. Then again, we're in a dream and who knows how much training the operatives have... I was also bugged by the fact that rules were explained for the dream layers and yet some seemed to have been ignored. I know it's ""dream logic"" but if you intentionally explain them, mostly stick to them so we can continue suspending disbelief. An example of this is how the guy in the hotel is supposed to have 2 minutes left until something has to happen, yet if you combine his sequences (because it alternates between 3 different stories/dream layers at that point), it's way more than the time alloted. For more, see the list of goofs on the main IMDb page (after watching the movie).Inception is praised as being complex and smart. Compared to the majority of other summer blockbusters, it certainly is. In the absolute though, I don't think it's the most brilliant or completely logically coherent movie out there. The base concept is better than the actual execution, which to be fair is pretty good. The interesting plot is certainly understandable for the majority of normal people so perhaps it makes them feel smart (therefore good about themselves). People who don't like it as much as they do, or point out logical flaws, are therefore not as ""smart"" as they are or simply ""don't get it"". It sometimes feels to me as if there was a mass ""inception"" (from peer pressure, the director's reputation or marketing?), planting the idea that this movie is amazing before even watching it and that if you're not totally enthusiastic about it, there's something wrong with you. I think people should be allowed to fall somewhere in-between. Enjoying it very much, recognizing its many qualities, but not seeing it as one of the best movies ever done (top 5 currently on IMDb is ridiculous). Why ? Because if you really think about it, I'm sure you've seen many movies that had a much more powerful emotional impact on you.Rating : 7 out of 10 (very good)"
119203,False,"... and I was full of hope that it would be rather like Stevie Wonder :)Comparing Inception (2010) with The Matrix (1997) is inevitable. The same concept defines both of them - the concept of perceiving the reality (or rather ""mispercieving""). And the same flaw of choosing not precisely the right way to tell the concept, ruins the final impression - the flaw of being pretentious.Matrix was very pretentious. It was pretentious enough to became a religion. Inception is not so. But still lacks the serious tone. I mean who the hell names the girl who builds mind labyrinths Ariadne??? It's SO OBVIOUS symbolism. And it's unnecessary - the whole concept needs realistic grounding or poetic quotation marks rather than references to mythology. Those quotations and groundings are delivered by Marion Cotillard (who is the most frightening ex I've seen in movies a long time). Her interpretation of Cobbs wife, Mal is a little treasure in that shallow chest. She makes this movie a tale about HUMANS instead of CHARACTERS. But everyone else in the team don't have that intuition.Except her, everything is more or less pretentious. Screenplay - besides quite original concept - spoils the fun by very bad dialogs, and predictable scenes (like for example the scene of testing Ariadne by Cobb, based on the ""rule of three"" - two mistakes gives you last chance to win). Next - we have here very poor director's and screenwriter's imagination revealed in quite boring or random creation of worlds visited by our team (and I don't want those worlds to be second Pandora from Avatar (2010). I want them to be less Cameron, more Lynch.) We have here very cheap ""entertaining while learning"" directing. The ways chosen by Nolan to describe the audience rules of dreaming are like from TV show Colombo - straight forward. Like the Infinite Staircase, or bunch of scenes where someone finds the way of solving some problem, and Cobb tells that's impossible, because... in dreams it's impossible. Gee, it's like reading an article in Newsweek! And because of those big expectations and ""masterpiece"" reviews I must to say this - this movie is too boring to be a masterpiece. I felt some suspense in few scenes (with Mal mainly), but the pacing is rather ...random and - sad thing to say - in the majority f the screen time, it's a result of constant background music.I think, that this movie should be a book in first place. Or maybe I should be like 10 years younger to be amused."
119204,False,"There is a clear hole in the plot, that is when Murphy(the subject/victim) makes a transition back from Level1 to Real world Level0. Here is the explanation stimulations.blogspot.com/2010/07/ is-there-hole-in-plot-of-inception-or.html what follows is my understanding of the chronology of subject's state of mind and his perceptions during the length of the story. From what is being presented in the movie, i see that the objective of Dicaprio's team was not actually met!! Why i think that way would hopefully be apparent towards the end. May be i am missing some point but please feel free to comment.Objective of DiCaprio's team: Implant a new idea/thought in the mind of Subject at Level 0. That is- by the end of the process, the subject in Level 0 should be aware/know with authenticity, about a NEW important information 'xyz' previously unknown to himSubject's/Victim's(Cillian Murphy) State of mind:Level 0: Traveling with bunch of guys in a plane. Duration of journey is 10hrs.Level1: Doesn't know that he is dreaming. He thinks it is real world. Inception team is his enemy and is harmful to him. His Godfather/Adviser(Tom Berenger)is a good man.Level2: Initially doesn't know that he is dreaming. He thinks it is real world Later, Dicaprio convinces him that, -this is a dream world, where his godfather is trying to extract info from him and Level 1 is the actual real world. -and that subject's Godfather knows some very important info relating to Business empire, which need to be extracted from him.Subject friends with DiCaprio's team.Level3: Knows he is dreaming. But still thinking that Level1 is real world, Level2 is Dream and now thinks he entered into Level3 which is the Dream of his Godfather(Berenger), to extract some valuable info.Level 4: Dead/Inanimate Ms.Page gives him a kick so that he could wake up/go live and continue on with his work back in Level 3Level 3:Now he extracted valuable info from the subconsciousness of Berenger. Goes through some Father-child emotion and changes his future direction. (From Dicaprio's perspective, New thought implanted into Subject's mind.(But notice new thought which is real with respect to only Level1 subject but not Level 0 subject ))Level 2: Knows he is dreaming. Thinks he is Just one level from Real world which for him has been Level 1. Thinks that with the help of his friends, he successfully extracted some valuable info(previously unknown to him) from his godfather's dreamFriends with DiCaprio's team Equipped with New info he extracted from his god father's dreamLevel 1:Friends with DiCaprio team. Thinks he is back to real world with the new thought carried from his Godfather's dream to Intermediate dream to real world. Ready to implement the thought in this Level 1 real world. He is not aware of the existence of any Level 0.Level 0:No relationship with Dicaprio team. Just Remembers about the new thought as a part of the dream(s) he had. But he comes to know that he Level 1 is just a dream but not real world .The new through is not from a real world experience.(This is the transition i would like to question. The movie doesn't show what the subject was thinking when he is back to this level 0. Everyone starts walking as if objective was achieved )what's not convincing is: The subject thinks that he just had a dream and the idea he had was part of just a dream. But not part of some REALLY planned extraction from his Godfather, which means there is no authenticity associated with the new thought he now has. But for the Subject who lived in Level1, yes since it is real world to him he would have followed the thought that is being implanted into him. But isn't the objective of Dicaprio team is to implant the idea with authenticity, into the mind of subject in Level 0 ? The subject would not follow the implanted idea in Level 0 because, he knows that the idea belongs to Level 1 which he consciously knows is a dream, meaning DiCaprio team's objective is not met.Am i missing something?"
119205,False,"An amazing thing happened to me with this film. Never before have my views on a film shifted so dramatically as with Inception. In fact it is my second review of it, I edited the first which was very unflattering. What happened? Well, by chance I read an eye-opening analysis at chud.com, and then I went to see it again, this time in IMAX and with better sound. Chud's piece on this is quite brilliant and profound. I also shows that sometimes it is not enough to see a film, especially such an ambitious one, it is important to read about it, for example what the director says about it. Chud explains that in an interview Nolan reveals this is kind of autobiographical film for him, in a metaphysical sense. It is about... making films, about creative process! Yes yes, not about Matrix so much. DiCaprio confirms it, he says it is much more like ""8 and a 1/2"" was for Fellini than it is another Matrix. Cobb's team is like a film crew: a director (Cobb), producer (Saito), screenwriter (Ariadne), actor/ actors (Eammes, Fisher). And then there's Mal: a director's or artist's fetish or obsession, something that an original artist usually tends to bring into his work, for better or worse. That is why some good directors should not write scripts, like Cobb, you see? Chud then explains that seen this way, the ENTIRE film is a dream, Cobb's dream. We cannot be even sure that his wife is dead in his ""real life"", maybe she has just left him? The purpose of such a film for Nolan: analysis of why films work for us or not, why we identify with characters and feel for them or hate them, even if we know that what we r watching is unreal (a dream?). Chud brilliantly writes that some people can shed a tear or two during sad moments of the animated ""Up"" (or Toy Story), which does not diminish their emotions and does not make them untrue, even though they r reacting to pure fantasy. I for one was deeply moved when the young Fisher discovers what's in the safe and has a catharsis. I was moved with him, and I think Nolan tried to show us that such is the worth of good art and performance. Plus he included in this film elements from melodrama, heist movies, Bond movies etc., all in one. He could not include much of a comedy because it is supposed to be a dream of a sad character, someone who has apparently lost his wife. And when we know the entire film is a dream, many of its apparent inconsistencies or unlikely events do not trouble anymore, because it is Cobb's subconscious we are watching. And if Nolan says Cobb is like him we can guess Cobb is a film director in ""real life"", dreaming like a film making and about his wife that left him. Details start to make sense: bad goons cannot hit good characters - like in a dream or a bad action film, Cobb attaches the rope onto a chair in which Mal is seating though he has said he could not trust her, Mal is seating on a ledge opposite their hotel room and that room is like a copy of their room, the children look exactly the same and are dressed the same during the ending as before, the narrow alley moment in Mombasa, the explicit names like Ariadne (Greek mythology, the maze) or Mal (evil in French and Spanish), Ariadne asking Cobb what's in the snow castle FOR HIM when it was allegedly Fisher's dream... So I upgraded this film from weak 4 to a very strong 9 after that, for originality, ambition and high production values. Thanks to Chud, the film critic. I do not give it a perfect 10 because I still think the first hour is a bit flat and they talk too much in it."
119206,False,"With all the big budgets and technology Hollywood can get, what did we the audience get? Many sequels (And I dislike Dark Knight, being just a little better sequel).Since the Matrix was released more than 10 years ago, what did we the Sci-Fi film fans get compared with a decade or two before that? Chris Nolan delivered on these two accounts, and fewer and fewer directors in Hollywood can really master in commanding a complicated project and a good story telling, at the same time. I want more films like ""Inception"" coming to theaters here, which spent a lot of money making one as well as taking us to experience something other media, such as TV, games, can't offer. That is what we trade for paying the ticket to get in a theater.There is also a philosophical angle for the audience, I think. When we moviegoers are used to be overpowered by technology hard to distinguish among themselves, like computer graphics, animation, special effects, ..., unavoidably we find ourselves attracted to those with a ""FORM"" standing out among all, on top of such as acting of any particular roles, words of power of any particular scenes. ""FORM"" of this film will be something many to follow. If the derivatives of ""FORM"" to this film lead to a new spectrum for film makings, then that will be something interesting for us movie lovers to know first.The only thing I don't get it though - why did Saito and Fischer not recognize each other when they both waked up in the airplane? Aren't they supposed to know each other, being major competitors in the business they are respectively in?"
119207,False,"From Memento, to The Prestige, to The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan is quickly becoming one of the premiere directors of intellectual, yet crowd-pleasing entertainment. Now, just to jump right in, Inception continues this trend, while demonstrating more creativity than perhaps any of his other films.If there's one complaint that I can imagine people having over this film, it's that the plot can be particularly difficult to follow. And while I feel that this is true to some extent, that's because Inception is, in and of itself, a puzzle. All of the pieces are presented to you, and solving it depends not so much on intelligence, but on whether or not you find that sort of element appealing in a movie. It's a film in which much of the dialogue is spent simply explaining the rules of this complex dream world, and therefore demands that you be wide awake.Even so, there had still better be an endearing cast of characters to follow, especially with this being a two-and-a-half hour experience, and thankfully, Inception delivers. While none of them, outside of DiCaprio's character, have much back story to speak of, they all feature exceptionally likable personalities, so by the time that the stirring climax hit, I was concerned about the fate of each and every one of them. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance as DiCaprio's right-hand man, Arthur, blew me away in particular. The guy doesn't have a ton of screen time, but damn, does he leave an impression! Ultimately, however, Inception is the story of DiCaprio's character, Cobb. Now, I won't say much, as giving any plot details outside of the synopsis would be a crime, but suffice it to say, it's some pretty engrossing stuff, and DiCaprio definitely brings his A-game here.Also, as expected, Hans Zimmer proves once again that he is the boss when it comes to musical scores, as each scene is enhanced tremendously by his material. He's the sort of musician who can make even the simplest of actions seem more important than anything else that's happened in human history. If only you, sir, could score my life.With its challenging narrative structure, likable characters (if somewhat lacking in depth), and sheer visual splendor, Inception is easily among my favorite movies of the year, second only to Pixar's latest classic. It's been a rough summer movie season, and while we've still got quite a few weeks left before it's officially over, Inception succeeded in reminding me why I dig this medium so much."
119208,False,"This aims to be Memento, but Nolan hasn't been able to produce anything with as much depth as Memento since his second film; I understand that would be difficult to do as I'm a huge fan of Nolan and Memento. This story however is extremely hallow and full of unnecessary action for the sake of action. This is pop corn; this is bubble gum. Inception doesn't come close to depths of Memento. This is a very good action/sci-fi movie, but not a great one at that. It was made to sell a lot of tickets and a lot of popcorn, but there is no other reason this film exists much beyond that. To try and pass this off as a deep film is an insult to many filmmakers that came before and are still around now. It's even an insult to Nolan's own Memento. This movie is based around a trick. And maybe it's even a good trick. Maybe it's not? But in the end, it feels like I watched this for the same reason I would do a crossword puzzle or a brain tease-to have an entertaining mental challenge for a brief moment, but this movie doesn't go much beyond that. I didn't care about the characters, if Nolan wanted me to care about these characters he would have spend more time with the characters, gone deeper into the relationship between DiCaprio and his wife, but instead he spent more time with silly mind tricks and mindless gunfights so that you'd spend more on popcorn. This movie insulted my intelligence by thinking that I'd be wooed by this empty, hallow mind trick."
119209,False,"I read the reviews for this movie, asked my friends about it and decided to take a look. After about 45 minutes into it I found myself sorely disappointed with the acting, the story progression, and the development of the characters (no genuine or believable character development, other than the obvious and predictable growth of DiCaprio). Watanabe, Page, and Gordon-Levitt demonstrated some of the poorest acting I've seen since Con Air. Watanabe was difficult to understand 90% of the time. Gordon-Levitt's attempt to portray a cool & steely partner was grossly unbelievable. Page came across aggravating and, in many ways, out of place. The Bottom-line: I believe that the movie did a good job of hypnotizing everyone into thinking that the Matrix want-to-be story was deep or intriguing. Please don't waste your time seeing this movie."
119210,False,"I didn't have high expectations coming into this movie, but when I left, I decided this was one of the best films I had ever seen. This is certainly Nolan's best work. The acting is exceptional, the story line is mind-blowing, and the action is fantastic! Nolan's film kept me on the edge of my seat the entire 2+ hours. The last hour of the film has to be the greatest theater experience I've ever had. I saw Inception twice, as I heard you will get more out of it the second time, which was very true. If you are unclear on some things the first time you see it, go again! It's even better the second time. You will be thinking about this film days after you see it, and probably have some very intense dreams. 10/10"
119211,False,"If you think that The Dark Knight was Christopher's Best you surely haven't seen Inception. There's not a single moment in the movie you wanna miss. It just keeps on getting better and better. The cast is great but the story is such that it takes all the credit away. Kudos to Christopher Nolan. You indeed are the pioneer of film-making. The visual effects are also awesome. As usual great background score by Hans Zimmer, amazing cinematography, gravity defying stunts. Hoping that Christopher Nolan continues his streak of blockbuster movies by making one every two years. Its just the summer blockbuster you are looking for. A summer package of AWESOMENESS!"
119212,False,"I cannot say enough good about this movie. There are so many excellent forces that made this movie that superb piece of art that it is. First, of course, is Nolan's direction. There is some seriously enlightened direction going on here. It starts off a bit slow (as most of his movies do), but he shortly throws it into overdrive. Before long, the movie is roaring past you. It's exhilarating, simply put.Nolan's writing is also top notch. The dialogue is refreshingly real, sharp, and coherent. In the beginning, viewers might find themselves a bit lost (don't worry, it's intentional), but Nolan slowly exposes INCEPTION's secrets. The plot direction carries this movie from being a simple heist movie (in the same vein as, say, OCEAN'S 11) to an emotional, thoughtful, intelligent, and utterly astounding thriller. If Nolan doesn't receive a directing or writing Oscar for this movie, then there is something seriously wrong the Academy.Also worth mentioning are the visual effects and stunts. The VFX are seamless. Even in the film's most visually intense moments, it's not entirely evident that Nolan is using CGI. Of particular mention is a fight scene that takes place in a unstable-gravity hotel hallway. As the actors twist and writhe all over a room where gravity is in flux, the viewer is left dumbfounded by the surprising realism of the scene. There's no other way to say this: INCEPTION looks great.Finally, we come to the acting. If anything could steal the spotlight from Nolan's directing and writing, it would certainly be the efforts put forth by the cast. Overall, the cast has impeccable chemistry. Everyone plays together so well. - Of course, Leonardo Dicaprio was solid. The role isn't much of a deviation for him, but he plays it well. His most emotionally intense moments hit hard and his character is developed very well. He deftly leads a relatively-unknown, but unbelievably-talented cast. There isn't that much ""star power"" in this movie, but the caliber of the acting is superb. - Marillon Cotillard was unbelievable. Her role is arguably the film's most versatile and she expertly glides through each aspect of her character. She's a very talented actress who works so well with Dicaprio. Their relationship is one of the emotional high-points of the movie and that is thanks entirely to each actors' powerful contributions to the heartbreaking reality of the relationship. - Ellen Page did a great job in her supporting role, bringing some of her signature wit into it. She has a very big on screen presence and she fits in surprisingly well with the mostly-male main cast. - Joseph Gordon Levitt and Tom Hardy stole the show, in my opinion. They each play two very well-crafted characters extremely well. Levitt plays a resourceful, no-nonsense point man that wonderfully counters Dicaprio's somewhat-unstable character. Hardy plays a charismatic thief that goes from devious trickster to full-blown action hero. These guys have some seriously impressive acting chops and it was truly a delight to watch their performances. - Cillian Murphy, like Dicaprio, is mostly sticking to a role that he knows, which is not a bad thing. Murphy is a talented actor, which is readily apparent in his last big scene in the movie (one of the movie's most emotional moments). - Ken Watanabe and Dileep Rao also add a lot to the overall chemistry of the ensemble. Their presence, though not as major as some of the other characters, definitely help solidify the ensemble's power.INCEPTION will stand the test of time as one of the great American films. Nolan is a superb director and cunning writer who has assembled an elite group of actors to create a visually stunning, thrilling adventure. You'd be crazy to not want to go along for the ride."
119213,False,"As a fiction writer, I very much enjoy creating stories, worlds, and trying to keep everything tied together. IT's a great challenge. Christopher Nolan is a genius at creation. His movies are groundbreaking, and Inception is just another one of his phenomenal creations.The first 15 minutes were tough to figure out, but later you understand how those scenes were relevant to the story, and the rest of it really wasn't that hard for me - it made sense. The score was fantastic - I noticed that Nolan loves to infuse music into the film almost the whole time, rather than in key moments. It adds to the drama - I like it.The acting was very strong. Leo is a talented actor and did his thing in this movie. The rest of the cast was strong also, but I don't know if any of them will win major awards - except maybe the ex-wife. She was great. Nolan used a couple of actors from the Batman movies in there - that was interesting.One flaw I could pick on was that it wasn't clear what anyone else's motivation was to finish the Inception job. Clearly Leo's character had a goal, but I couldn't really tell why the others were so loyal and accommodating. Maybe I missed the monetary reward offered? The reality bend in Inception was done to perfection. Rang very similar to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in that regard.The movie was gorgeous to look at. The style was similar to his other recent films - and that's a very good thing.And the ending. What can I say, it was one of the most satisfying endings I've ever seen. I walked out and just nodded my head. Yep. Very nice. Extraordinarily well done film."
119214,False,"...its THAT good, i actually bothered to review a film for the first time. The concept is just fantastic, so original. The actors are brilliant, the special effects are spectacularly mind bending. The whole thing is a perfectly balanced roller coaster ride; twisting and turning but not confusing, action packed but not a gore show, fast paced and yet containing enough philosophical themes to keep you talking and thinking for a long time. I can safely say this is the best film I've seen all year.Go and see it while it's in the cinema, I'm pretty sure 90-95% of people who watch it will love it."
119215,False,"How could Christopher Nolan possibly follow up The Dark Knight, one of the most important movies of the past decade? The answer to that would be Inception. It was an ambitious task to take on and Nolan proves that the only man for this task was himself. In one of the most unusual and complicated movies ever made, Nolan succeeds in thrilling the viewer while holding the viewer in a vise, never once letting a person's eyes leave the beautiful, dreamy images displayed on the screen. Though Nolan proved himself a master of cinema three times with Memento, The Dark Knight, and The Prestige, he has once again provided regular movie-goers and film buffs alike with a movie that will be remembered for decades to come as a classic.Summarizing Inception is not quite as easy as it seems. From the very beginning, the viewer is dropped into Nolan's imaginative dream world in which Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, the Extractor. The Extractor's job is to perform inception, that is, plant information in someone's mind via his dreams. And this is exactly the job that Cobb is trying to perform in the beginning when he is double crossed by Saito (Ken Watanabe). Saito then asks Cobb to aide him in getting a business rival named Fischer (Cillian Murphy) to disband Fischer's father's empire. Cobb takes the job and assembles a team to help him perform the inception including Ariadne(Ellen Page), who takes a job as an Architect, the person who designs the dream worlds. Cobb's job is made difficult by Mal (Marion Cotillard), his dead wife who is now reappearing in dreams and wreaking havoc for Cobb. Other cast includes Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Michael Caine.As one can see from my ""brief"" summary, the film is extremely complicated. But this is far from accidental on Nolan's part. Dreams are commonly blurred with reality, making it hard for the viewer to distinguish what is real and what is dreamed. After all, Cobb does say that ""Dreams feel real when we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize that something was actually strange."" As the characters delve further into the visually stimulating dream world, the plot becomes even harder to follow, but not necessarily in a bad way. The film culminates in five plots occurring simultaneously for about an hour of the film. Yet the viewer stays interested in the film. Nolan had me thoroughly engrossed for the entire two and a half hours that the movie lasted.But the film's beauty lies not in its impressive cast or original plot, but rather in its rich technical work. The special effects in this film are very realistic and certainly fun to watch. When Ariadne is first introduced to the dream world, Cobb proves that the world she is currently in is a dream by letting Paris explode. The scene is useless to the plot, but it does not matter for the sole reason that it is gorgeous. In another scene, two characters fight in a hallway that has no gravity. The scene is thrilling, but what is most interesting is that it looks so real. The film's cinematography is equally arresting. Nolan uses slow motion multiple times throughout the movie, each of which involves water. The slow motion is completely unnecessary, but it is unbelievably beautiful, so it really does not matter that it is presented to us for no apparent reason.Forget the acting. Forget the special effects. Forget the plot. Inception boils down to Christopher Nolan. Nolan is the reason why the film works, why it is so visually arresting, why it succeeds in making a viewer think hours after watch it. For a year in which very few great movies have come out, Nolan's Inception sticks out because it is original--it is an idea that is entirely new, and for that reason alone, it should be highly commended. But Nolan has superseded this. Inception rises to a new level because it has great acting, a twisted web of a plot, and ornate special effects. It may not be better than some of Nolan's previous work, but it sure is great. This is the stuff dreams are made of."
119216,False,"'Inception' is an amazing, imaginative, innovative, clever, exhilarating, and (there are way too many positive adjectives to describe the film) bad-ass film. I think Christopher Nolan has finally found, no, created, his magnum opus - an amazing feat, considering how early Nolan really is in his directorial career.In 'Inception', director Christopher Nolan takes us into a world where entering peoples' dreams is a reality. In this world, there are people called 'Extractors' whom are able to enter peoples' dreams and steal any type of information from practically anyone. Leonardo DiCaprio's character, Dom Cobb, is the most skilled Extractor, and he has a very important job to do - a job that the basic plot revolves around. Dom Cobb is hired by a very powerful Japanese businessman, Saito (Ken Watanabe) to do the impossible - implant a brand new idea into another person's mind; this task is called inception. The target is another businessman, a rival of Saito's, named Robert Fischer, Jr. (Cillian Murphy). The task of inception requires in-depth planning, and requires experts in a variety of fields. Thus Cobb must assemble a team of top- notch professionals in those certain important fields.The remarkable Joseph Gordon-Levitt portrays Arthur, Cobb's right-hand man, and has the important task of researching and learning about his targets. The lovely Ellen Page portrays Ariadne, an architect whose sole responsibility is to create the complex world of the dream. Tom Hardy portrays Eames, a wise-cracking shape-shifter, of sorts. And Dileep Rao portrays the chemist, Yusuf, who provided the special drugs that enabled everyone to enter dreams - he's also important for driving that van; you'll know what I'm talking about.Cobb's team is amazing, and each and every one of them is unique and likable in their own ways. These characters' unique-ness and likability is helped by the fact that they're portrayed by a bunch of strong actors and actresses. The ensemble cast in 'Inception' truly is remarkably strong and superb. So many characters in 'Inception' are portrayed by well-known actors and actresses that I'm glad none of them were wasted. From the trailers, I figured the characters of Saito (Watanabe) and Fisher, Jr. (Murphy) would have minimal screen-time, because I figured their characters (the former the client, the latter the target) just wouldn't be focused on as much. However, I'm glad I was wrong. Watanabe's character stuck around for the entire film, and is actually important, though you won't know it till the end of the film. And Murphy's character was also featured a lot and important to the overall movement of the plan. Gordon-Levitt's Arthur is very charming and goofy, and the funny scenes that were actually included in 'Inception' were all funny because he was in it.I loved Ellen Page's character. Christopher Nolan was actually very smart for putting a character like Ariadne in the film - her character helps us understand the film better. Since Ariadne is new to the concept of entering other people's dreams (as are we) and all of the complex rules that apply to them, it's extremely helpful when she asks questions since she's as confused about certain things as we, the audience, are. Page's Ariadne is like our senator or representative for the film, since she practically does represent us, and raises the same question as we do.The complexity of 'Inception' is purposely frustrating and confusing. The film works because of that. And I love movies that make the audience frustrated and make them have to work with the movie in order to enjoy it (if they're done right, which 'Inception' definitely did). Films like 'Inception' are more enthralling when they're challenging, because you become even more satisfied when you actually succeed in understanding them.The only major problem I had with 'Inception' was the fact that many times I couldn't understand what Saito was saying, and most of the time he was saying something important. It's important to pay attention to every single line spoken in the film, so when I couldn't understand Saito in his many important scenes, it left me clueless and confused. Also, I couldn't get over the fact that Saito promised Cobb that he would be able to fix all of Cobb's problems with just one phone call. How is he able to do that? Although I'm disappointed that the film never really explains this, I think it's actually better that it didn't.'Inception' is a near-perfect film, and requires multiple viewings to truly understand its complexity. Christopher Nolan is an amazing director who hasn't made one bad film yet! I trust his ability to continue this streak. Freaking-A! I cannot get over the very final scene of 'Inception.' That final moment, I think, was the perfect way to end off the film. It's the kind of ending that will frustrate people, but it's also the kind of ending that's debatable, and is either praised or hated. I, personally, loved the ending. However, I did, along with almost everyone else in the theater, go ""Awww"" and ""Omg"" after that last, important scene. I just love how that ending teases everyone. 'Inception' definitely lives up to, or even surpasses, the hype surrounding it! The film is amazing on multiple levels, and in multiple ways, for multiple reasons. It's the movie of the summer. It's the movie of the year. And, quite frankly, it's one of the best movies of the decade."
119217,False,"I just cannot explain how awesomely awesome this movie is. Overwhelming, but in a completely good way is a very good word to explain this. The actors were all SO fantastic. There wasn't one of them that wasn't completely believable in their role. The FX were just spectacular and really helps to transport you in to this movie. The story and whole concept of this Inception thing and how they do it just totally blows your mind. I mean it really does. This movie made me feel like I had been sitting on the edge of my seat and holding my breath. I could not wait for the next whatever to happen and to see how everything played out."
119218,False,"Let me begin by addressing the criticisms of this film: that it's either too slow, too complicated, or superficially emotional. All of these claims are completely and utterly misguided and wrong.Inception is a movie unlike any other. It combines heart-stopping action, mind bending psychological concepts, and deep emotional conflicts, wraps them in a tight, perfectly edited package, and drop kicks you with them in the face. The cool part is that you won't be surprised at how little you understand, but rather how much you understand. The scripting and pacing is so well planned and pieced together and everything is explained in the perfect amount of detail, which serves to make the end of the movie a mind-blowing climax of epic proportions.Scoring by Hans Zimmer is to die for. It's a mysterious combination of elements of Batman, Bourne, and Quantum of Solace, which are all revolutionary scores, and it completes the movie. But let's be serious, everything completes this movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, DiCaprio, and Ellen Paige all turn in rock star performances. The only character that feels underdeveloped is ""Fischer,"" who comes off as cold, but whose emotional transformation isn't entirely convincing. Luckily, the rest of the movie is so engrossing at every moment that this does not detract from the overall experience. Nolan doesn't need to fall back on high-buck CGI either. The sets, locales, and visuals are stunning without being overbearing.These gorgeous visuals, ludicrous editing, brilliant scoring, a synergistic cast, and a plot that makes you think and rewards you for your mental effort combine to transform this from a movie into an amazing mental journey."
119219,False,"I had been following Christopher Nolan's Inception from the moment it was announced that he was working on his next film following The Dark Knight. The initial teaser, debuted some time ago with it's powerful, moving score set in motion what I would call borderline fanboy-ism. The actual theatrical trailer only supplemented it. When opening week hit I began reading some initial reviews coming out of rotten tomatoes and had some notion of what I should be expecting out of the film. I tried to limit my expectations even though some extremely positive reviews were coming in.Inception is one of those films that makes you think during it's entire plot. The setup is simple enough: Dom Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, has a very unique job. He is an extractor, a man who delves into the layers of people's minds, deep into their subconscious, to extract information; thoughts and ideas that the dreamer isn't even aware of knowing. The world Dom is a part of is not built as complete as say, Gotham City, but it also doesn't need to be, as the majority of the time the film is taking place in a dreamworld. Dom, suspected of killing his own wife Mal (Marion Cotillard), is unable to return home to his children. In order to pass immigration back to America he is forced to do one final job, one that is the opposite of extracting, rather, he is to plant an idea, an inception point, into a man's subconscious.To do so would require more help than his usual point man Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). He enlists the aid of Ariadne (Ellen Page), Eames (Tom Hardy), Saito (Ken Watanabe) and Yusuf (Dileep Rao) to help him create the dream. Each team member has their own jobs pertaining to the dream that they will eventually share with the dreamer Robert Fischer, played by the ever scrupulous Cillian Murphy. The supporting cast is just astounding and anything I say, if I could say anything, would be mere nitpicking. Leo himself plays his role as well as ever.The level of cinematic brilliance that Nolan has brought forth here is so astounding that I have absolutely no negative comments to talk about. Each moment of this film as brilliant as the next. The set pieces are large in scale and are beautiful. It is no simple feat to create a world such as this but Nolan seemingly does it with relative ease. The mind is a complex thing, and this film merely supplements that idea. Bear in mind that this is no low budget film, some 200 million was put forth to form what we see as the delicate architecture of the human mind. The CGI that almost always accompanies such a budget is impeccable and is near photo realistic as it does not cast you out of the film but simply reels you in further. The pacing too is strong and I can't say it even has a dipping point after the first thirty minutes. The action sequences remind me of the Bond series, and for the better. Nolan even stated that it had a part of his inspiration and it shows. There are even some comedic bits for good measure, however discrete they are. No film that I have seen in a very long time encapsulates a perfect balance of everything that you see here.Plainly stated, Inception is a masterpiece of this decade and only continues to firmly root Nolan among the worlds most renowned director's. I urge you to go in with your mind open, you will not be disappointed."
119220,False,"This movie just ruined my imagination as it is so complex and thrillingly amazing it will get on one's mind and word as an adhesive making you stick to the edge of your seats till you give up in front of its elegance maturity. A wonder full screenplay and a cinematic extravaganza. a movie to be preserved. Leonardo Di Carpio is amazing. It is a clear ace. Watch it for his story and the wonderful concept of an idea being a crime scene. this is heck of a good thriller... good.. this is the best of the best. Kudos to Christopher Nolan for gifting us with the following, memento, insomnia, batman begins, the prestige, the dark knight and his best inception."
119221,False,"Dear Christopher, I first suspected something might be a little off when a high octane action sequence at the start turns out to be happening in a virtual reality constructed in somebody's mind. When you see all the characters reclining unconscious a la Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and the gang 'in the real world', there was a 'Matrix rip-off' alert going off inside me! Im just shocked that only the Independent (UK), New York Observer, Village Voice and a few other reputable critics have managed to see through your borderline plagiarism-filled, overlong, ridiculously plotted, boring, self-important excuse for a movie. Lucky for you, everyone seems to love it. Did you enter their unconscious and plant the idea??? Its a really bad idea to try and rip off the Matrix. That movie has been made already. Its a really good movie. Unfortunately, Mr. Nolan, you didn't come up with the idea for that movie. The Wachowski brothers did. Get over it. Make your own movies. I thought Dark Knight and Memento and some of your other flicks were fine and enjoyable but this is utter garbage. Why didn't you go all the way and get Leo to wear a full-length leather jacket and master some Kung Fu techniques? Some folks left early (lucky for them). I'll be urging everyone not to waste time or money on seeing this crap. Sincerely Eoghan"
119222,False,"I'm not often driven to write a review but this needs to be said. Billed with rave reviews expectation was high, but this film is totally over rated, Unengaging, uninteresting & down-rite boring.. at best contrived & designed to bamboozle the General viewing demographic into believing it is an amazing masterful multi layered work of Genius, in fact its simply a long winded futile effort at re-branding the matrix concept of virtual reality.... The first hour is taken up by efforts to convince and educate the Audience at the lowest intellectual level, so anyone with half an 'o'level awaits the actual story with Grinding misery... when eventually the director feels we are up to speed what we have in store is just a jumbled overly contrived story of not particularly interesting content.. the only redeeming feature this film has to offer is a fleeting philosophical moment of ""what if...."" please take a pillow and a book if you choose to endure this films transparent 2hrs+ of flashing lights loud atmospheric musical score... I'm generally a positive glass is half full kinda Guy.. but this is definitely an empty cigarette-butt tainted post hangover stale beer bottle of a film...."
119223,False,"Watching Inception with its futuristic emphasis on getting inside people's heads through dreams, especially hearing Leonardo DiCaprio explain the pitfalls to newbie Ellen Page, I couldn't help thinking about Forbidden Planet and that warning about monsters from the Id. Did earth manage to conquer what the Krells could not?Christopher Nolan wrote and directed Inception and though it gets a bit heavy at times, it still is an unmistakable masterpiece. Leonardo DiCaprio stars in this and he's essentially a cat burglar of the mind. His mission usually is to invade people's dreams and steal ideas which makes him an invaluable espionage agent. But Leo's also a wanted man.Some problems Leo has relating to his Id have forced him to rely on others to create dream worlds. He was working against Japanese billionaire industrialist Ken Watanabe and got caught, but then Watanabe likes his style and hires Leo and his team to do a job on the young heir to a communications conglomerate, Cillian Murphy. It's not to steal anything, but to plant an idea in his brain with the dream team. The film is essentially how DiCaprio and his crew go about this job with Watanabe incidentally along for the ride. And its how Leo has to deal with some real demons involving guilt that force him to rely on others.Very nice computer graphic generated special effects characterize Inception and it will probably earn an Oscar nomination next year in that category. Director Nolan gets his talented cast to read writer Nolan's dialog with verve and conviction. I truly hope this technology is not in our near future that would be a frightening thought."
119224,False,"I heard a number of great things about Inception, including from my sister who came out saying it was one of the cleverest and best movies she'd seen. After seeing it for myself, I thought it was a good film, but not as good as I was led to believe. Out of the Christopher Nolan movies I have seen, Inception didn't wow me as much as Memento and The Prestige, and it is one of my least favourites of his so far. Does that mean the film is bad? No, I am just saying I do not think it is Nolan's best as I have heard people say.My main problem with Inception was the lack of emotional attachment, I do understand completely anybody who says it is emotionally cold. Particularly in the characters, they are written and acted well, but not much is done to make us empathise with them and their predicaments. I loved the idea of the story, it was clever and somewhat original and it did start very compelling and intriguing, but as the film progresses it does become rather convoluted and I found myself losing a little interest. Also, the pace is uneven, as the characters became more cold and the story more convoluted, the film really does start to drag until the conclusion where the film does thankfully pick up.Inception despite these faults does have a number of strengths, especially the beautifully crafted production values, dream sequences and effects and Nolan's superb direction. Hans Zimmer's score is incredibly good too, while powerful and haunting it rarely becomes overbearing, while the dialogue is on the whole clever and thought-provoking. The acting is generally very good, both Leonardo DiCaprio, with a more hardened persona which has grown even more, and Ellen Page give strong performances and while Marion Cotillard is underused she is pretty good as well and Cillian Murphy I think gives the best supporting performance as he is superb.Overall, Inception is a generally good film but not as good as it is lauded to be. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
119225,False,"I'm sure I'll revisit Inception, sooner rather than later. Christopher Nolan's film has its ambitions, oh sure to be sure. But when one looks at what he is really trying to accomplish here, it's to tell a story and with verve, originality (or at least taking solid cinematic forms and archetypes and using them originally), and a point of view that is astonishing. I still have scenes and images, performances and moments, shots and details of the plot (and a kick-ass final shot especially) rolling around in my head, and I don't want them to go away. Even things about the film that I should find flawed, such as a little clunky exposition and some edits that go by lightning fast work because of what does count: we care about what happens to these characters, or at least Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), and whether or not they'll achieve this ""mission"" of putting an idea in someone's head.To explain all of the finer mechanics of the plot... just go to wikipedia, or IMDb's plot synopsis. I'll just say for here that the film takes its own creation of science-fiction variety seriously. And seriously enough to take jaded moviegoers of the cineplex variety along for the ride. It's kind of like a heist plot, though not really, in that ""idea"" thieves- people who use dreams, shared via inter-connecting tubes (like the Matrix only more complex)- are recruited by Saito (Ken Watanabe), a big businessman of some sort to plant an idea in someone's head, or 'inception', which has not been done except for once when Cobb did it to a certain someone (he won't mention why, for a big reveal in the last act, though not a twist). That's really what you need to know - that and Ariadne (Ellen Page) will act as the audience in a sense to keep exposition going... sometimes too much on a first viewing.And yet, for all of the characters standing around explaining things, which should be (and is) a big no-no in movies (SHOW don't TELL, remember), it can work here because a) it is such a complex concept, considering all of the calculations of time, as well as the 'rules' of sort, which are laid out so well that nothing can be too confusing for anyone, even if one wanted to, and b) the acting is so good in doing it. There is genuine emotion as well, which is something that some of the so-so or negative reviews find is lacking here (there are a handful out there if you'd believe it Nolan-heads). I say simply that if you don't find emotion during those scenes between DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard, who used such a one-dimensional character to her total advantage here and steals all of her scenes with a beautiful face and haunting delivery- then, well, maybe you got the wrong movie.Sure, there's lots of pyrotechnics and big gun battles, but they work for the sake of this story and the circumstances too. I was worried they wouldn't, that things might be too rigid in the sense of it being dreams, why are there all of these guns and violence and whatnot. But, for me, it ended up making much more sense, in a non-sensible ""Hollywood Movie"" way, watching it unfold within the rules. It is much more sci- fi-thriller than a David Lynch surrealist trip anyhow, and on Nolan's terms he bases his own sense of lucid dream logic. I also really liked how the stakes were so high for the characters in dreams: if you die in a dream, for example, what if you don't wake up, but end up in a kind of dream limbo, or something bizarre like that? How do these levels affect you if you're injured or dying? This is not as simplified as in the Matrix, albeit with less 'tells' than showing it happen. Aw hell, who cares? This is creative summer entertainment on one hand, and a brainy-emotionally-psychologically engaging story with a melancholy core. When it gets thrilling, it thrills (hallway fight, anyone), and when it needs to move, it does so, or when it needs to provide little ""ooh"" visual wonders like Joseph Gordon Levitt floating along and doing his part in the time-frame, Nolan comes up with wonders there too. It shouldn't require a repeat viewing, yet I do want to go back again, not to have things re-explained to me, which is unnecessary, but to revisit the characters, the multi-layered (literally) story structure, and the intensity of the direction. It's a helluva trip through the ""architecture of the mind"", and a very fine return to form to the 'early' sort of mind-f***er movies Nolan's made in the past."
119226,False,"I want my money back. This movie was long, boring, the storyline made no sense and every time you tried to make sense of it they would throw in visual effects that were frankly, pathetic. Do not believe the ""fresh"" reviews. The movie is so overrated and all the characters are so annoying. The ending was predictable and a disappointing. It's not a good sign when people are shrugging at each other or snoring. What a waste--those $200 million could have been spent on our economy. Ugh. Save yourselves! Honestly, the movie is a rip off of a Japanese animation film called Paprika. It also rips off ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and the ""Matrix."" You do not relate or even care about the characters. They did so much explaining (they had to) that it was like, just give me the script and I'll read it at home, already. There was so much confusion in the the theater and the smart people left the first 45 mins. I wanted it to get better, for the sake of my wallet, to no avail. This movie is a ""Product"" that did not deliver, so I wish I had the balls to demand my money back."
119227,False,"I have seen many great movies and i have seen this movie, but it was not up to my standards. The plot was a little confusing (when i say a little, i mean a lot) but on the lighter side the fight scenes were good so were the actors that participated like Leonardo DiCaprio (really awesome actor he was in Blood Diamond, and of course Titanic)there was also Pete Postlethwaite (who died recently, you would of seen him in Jurassic Park and The Usual Suspects)that is not all Michael Caine got a role in this movie and i am sure everyone knows of his work. 3/10. (-7/10 because of the plot) I recommend you still watch it no matter what i said, or what other people said because everybody has there own opinions. Kind regards, ben-james300"
119228,False,"Watching Inception, I actually felt as if I had lost my short term memory faculty. I think various characters, especially little DiCaprio and his sidekick Joeph Gordon-Levitt, were forever explaining things. What had happened, what would happen, why somethings might happen and why other things might not happen etc etc. But after a while it became impossible to retain the nonsensical gobbledygook that was being spouted and I kept asking myself why are they doing this, why are they doing that? Why are they in the middle of a snow covered mountain? Why is that guy floating around, tying everybody up and stuffing them down a lift shaft? I think all this was explained. Was it? Oh I can't remember. But then a sense of complete ennui took over my body. A listlessness so total that I could not summon up the energy to even try to follow this nonsense.Today's film makers often pay their respects to the great directors of the past, but their praise and appreciation is entirely bogus. It cannot be otherwise, considering they have no notion how to develop plot, how to create characters that live and breathe and exude vitality. For Christopher Nolan, wit drama and tension may be beyond him, but surely simple coherence is not too much to ask? I am very aware that many people love this film, indeed some even declare it a work of genius (dear oh dear!), but there are some dissenting voices. And for those who recognise Inception for the nullity it is, I have more than once seen the story of ""The King's New Clothes"" being invoked to describe how so many people seem to have been taken in by this nothing of a picture. But whilst I agree with most of the views of the dissenters, I must take issue with those who use the ""King's New Clothes"" as a simile. And the reason is simple, this movie is not fit to mentioned in the same breath, even via an unflattering comparison as Hans Anderson's marvellous story. Anderson created, in a few short pages a storytelling masterpiece,; a strong narrative, compelling characters and a classic denouement, all told with brevity wit and clarity.And at the core of the story is an ethical and moral issue that people can, and have debated for centuries And all these characteristics in this gem of the storytellers art, are totally missing in Nolan's boring incoherent mess. In short, rather than be compared to Anderson's great little story, Nolan should be studying it closely to see how a story can be successfully told."
119229,False,"Once every 10 or 20 years comes a film that revolutionises cinema. A film that smashes boundaries and sends you on a journey through time and space. A film that not tears up the rule book. It pours gasoline on it and sets it on fire and then watch it burn to a crisp! INCEPTION, is this film. ...I sat for about two minutes after the movie had ended, in awe of what I just witnessed. THIS MOVIE IS BRILLIANT! In a world where we have reboot after reboot and remake after remake. Then we have TV series revamps and the same old mindless, brainless action, drama, thriller movies from the same boring directors. Finally something original, fresh, clean and unadulterated comes along and just.....blows me away! So what makes this film so brilliant? For starters, the cast. Great cast, who all deliver great performances. DiCaprio continues to show that he's one of the best actors in the world at the moment and continues to impress as the leading man. Great support from Ellen Page, Tom Hardy and Jospeh Gordon Levitt. Ken Watanabe, Michael Caine, Cillian Murphy and Tom Berenger also did a great job. The chemistry between the actors is wonderful, clever script with sharp dialogue delivered with great timing. Secondly, the story. It's totally original. There are similarities with the Matrix, but those will be squashed once you've watched the film. The fact that the technology to enter a persons mind had already existed was brilliant. There's also no time line in this film, Inception takes place in the not too distant future, but it doesn't tell you when. And I'm glad it does this. There's nothing worse than watching a sci-fi film and being told what year you're in at the beginning of the movie. Nolan wants you to work out how far in the future we have come to possess such technology. This is his film, but it's also as if he wants you decide when it should take place. The film itself plot wise, goes through a number of hoops, but patience is virtue and everything that happens in the movie, happens for a reason. Gritty, solid set pieces and amazing special effects. The film plays with your mind and that's the best thing about Inception. It tugs at you little by little and when it finally gets a hold of you, it doesn't let go. You have to work out with your mind, what is actually happening? Where is this film taking me? I was hooked from the beginning and that's rare for me. I became so immersed, I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie. Once it came to the end I wanted more. Then I realised after a few minutes, I had to leave the cinema or get thrown out. Nolan is Spielberg with a higher IQ. He's a modern Hitchock, who knows how to make a film and tell a story. Do not be surprised if come March this is nominated for several awards. Best Picture and Director being two. I've written this review without giving too much away, even though what I've written, doesn't do the film justice. INCEPTION is on the same level as DARK KNIGHT in my opinion. With all the praise I've given it, INCEPTION is my film of the year. Over time it will be regarded as one of the greatest films ever committed to celluloid. It's one of the greatest movies you'll ever see. It's an experience, a journey and an adventure, INCEPTION. GO SEE NOW!"
119230,False,"The actors were exceptional, playing their roles with 100% adamant skill creating a killer cast which helped propel the movies momentum as it was hyped and psyched up prior to release.Upon watching the movie, each minute was a blast as much as a puzzle itself! thinking was imminent and necessary, hardly giving you time to lean back and take a bite of your popcorn. This movie isn't for you and your girlfriend to be all touchy in, but take her along if she's interested into movies which get your mind going like a maths test! Come to think about it, you can sort of see matrix through the backbone of the movie but it is clearly magical none the less! The action scenes were perfectly timed, making it adequate rather than over-done and time consuming. The dialog, which i believe is a VERY important factor to movie success, surpassed me, blowing my mind away at every moment. Leonardo DiCaprio has been on a true roll with a back to back spree with ""shutter island"" and now this, living up to audience expectations with his acting.Mind blowing action scenes, intellectually battering dialog, talented actors and a plot with a very imaginative basis and you get THE TOP MOVIE this year, INCEPTION. I recommend it to all, unless it's hard for you to understand complicated movies."
119231,False,If this story was so compelling and thought provoking why was the word dream mentioned over 800 times. The only thing this film had going for it were the special effects which were excellent. The cast and acting were solid but you didn't care about any of the characters because the story was so convoluted despite the performances. The audience which were all SAG members were laughing at the end because it was so ridiculous trying so hard to make sense of the impossible. Long at 140 minutes maybe okay for special effect junkies but that's it. You wanted so hard for the story to stimulate the mind but that was an exercise in futility.
119232,False,"Let me start by saying that I thought Inception was an amazing concept, highly creative, and visually stunning.I found the dialog, however, to be too shallow, literal, and over-saturated with exposition to drive the plot. There was no subtext to anything anyone said, very little character development of anyone but Leo's character, and I found myself not really caring about any of them more than I would a stranger in a tough situation. I've heard people say that Nolan is the new Kubrick. I would have to agree if I were judging him based on Inception alone. His combination of great-concept-little-character-development does mirror 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining, and Dr. Strangelove, where all the main characters are just out of reach.But looking at Nolan's past works like Memento and The Dark Knight, I wouldn't say the same thing, as the relationship dynamics in these two films were rich with layers and subtext. He also had other writers helping him with these films, whereas he was the sole writer on Inception. Maybe he shouldn't be flying solo as a writer yet. Amazing director, creative thinker, needs to work on creating more sophisticated dialog and developing interesting varied characters through character-defining decisions and how their decisions reflect/don't reflect their words. One character making one big decision at the end isn't enough to make up for 2 hours of shallow dialog."
119233,False,"This movie is over-rated. It is hard to follow, not just because some of the dialogue is very difficult to hear but because it is, purposefully, inherently confusing. I don't like to have to work quite as hard as I did in the beginning of this movie to be able to enjoy it.Also, I didn't really care about the characters. The type of ""craziness"" that Leonardo's character suffers from has been gone over time after time in movies, and I didn't find anything particularly compelling about Leo or the other characters. I want to deeply bond with the characters, and I didn't really do that in this movie.The visuals were truly stunning. And they do kind of wrap up everything by the very end. But in my view this movie is not nearly as good as everyone is making it out to be."
119234,False,"Like many other out there who have been reading about all the hype Inception has been bringing the World Wide Web, and possible your friends, I got to the movie theater as soon as I could to watch it. And let me tell you, this movie has a whole new twist. It is not a ""cookie cutter"" plot, it doesn't have a theme you have found in another movie, it is just flat out unique and amazing. (No wonder it took Nolan 8 years to release it!) The acting in this film is just flat out outstanding. After watching Cillian Murphy in ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Batman Begins"", it was hard to picture him acting in any other type of role. But this film just pushed the bar up a few more levels! He does an exceptional job with this film! Don't even get me started with DiCaprio's performance. You can just expect that to be great, and let me tell you, IT IS.Nolan choice to pick actors from the Batman Series (Michael Caine and Cillian Murphy) was a risky one. Its hard to picture these actors in another type of role after watching the Batman Series, especially the number of times I have re-watched them. But nonetheless, High Risk = High Reward, and without a doubt is this one a high reward.This movie will literally Blow you away. Its worth every penny. I watched the movie in 2D, and it was great. Take your family (Thats what I did! Everyone Loved it!) It will be a great experience, and if you don't decide to go see it yourself, I bet someone eventually will make you.Oh and trust me, you'll have a hard time falling asleep and dreaming in the movie theater with this film ;]"
119235,False,"inception ........it begins with confusion ...the movie ends with standing ovation.....in between there is a dream of Nolan that bounds n mesmerizes you .....dark knight , batman begins n memento.......are piece of fine craft but this movie brings Nolan in bracket of Cameroon's Spielberg's n lean's.......hope you enough i.e..dream of Nolan's master craft acting DiCaprio's in lead enough said .......hans beats, chills you out......11/10 for this movie.... hope after inception....it is only inception of further great works from NOLAN..Oscar who gives a damn.......carry on but please make movie every year ........"
119236,False,"To begin, I want to make it absolutely clear no matter what you read in the following article, go and see Inception. Christopher Nolan has been polluting the airwaves for over 10 years now with fantastic movies such as 'The Dark Knight' for action fans, 'Insomnia' for fans of psychological thrillers, and 'Memento' for those who like to think about a movie, a lot. But then steps forward Inception, Nolan's true masterpiece. It's nothing less than perfect. Like a combination of all his life's work, like everything up to this point have been mere obstacles he had to manoeuvre in order to make this fantastic piece of work. The plot is so difficult to explain that it would take an entire page just to make a dent, so lets say there's a man called Cobb (Leo DiCaprio) who steals things, he's a thief. Now lets say he can some how go into people's dreams and there thoughts. But in order to make a more engrossing and action packed story, lets say this time, he has to plant an idea. That's the very basics of what can only be described as, the most complicated, but monumentally brilliant story every created. The entire mythology Nolan has created around the dreamscape can only be compared to what other film makers did with the rules of time and space. The amazing amounts of thought and creativity that has gone into every little detail is incredible on it's own, but when you plan to make a movie based AROUND this idea, not ABOUT it, then you cross the border into pure Godliness. The only flaw that you can possibly spot within this labyrinth of a movie is however, the characters and their complete lack of story and depth. All apart from the main character, Cobb, they share equal amounts of restricted screen time as Nolan rightfully realised that in order to harness the story's true power, you need to focus on the story itself, rather than split it off into tangents every 5 seconds. Characters such as Ellen Page's curious architecture student Ariadne and Tom Hardy's truly magnificent Eames are used merely as pawns by Nolan to tell this epic and infatuating tale of sub-conscious dreaming, and so, they receive very little to no back story what so ever, leaving us the audience to work this out for ourselves. A very ballsy but spot on move from Nolan as we do start to generate feelings for these bare-bones projections and any back stories apart from Cobb's (which is the key to the entire plot) would have crippled the excitingly fast pace of the movie. There's barely a moment in the entire 148 minutes when something wasn't being explained or dreams weren't being explored meaning Incepion is a movie you have to keep both eyes on at all times. Miss one thing, even a little tiny explanation of a very small section of the dreamscape, and you could end up completely lost. It is because of this (the incredibly engaging plot) that when the credits roll and you are now forced the peel your eyes from the screen, the previous 148 minutes seems so real and so engaging, that the movie in itself felt like a dream. And an outstanding one at that. Inception manages to make Nolan's previous work look like a children's cartoon as far as complexity is concerned and acting-wise, it's pretty much on the same level. DiCaprio's leading performance is a very emotionally aware and painfully focused one and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy all put in fantastic performances also, but the fact is, they didn't have to. Their believable acting is just another satisfying tick on the clipboard, not a requirement as the story takes over the entire audience's attention. Sure if they had been really bad it would be noticeable, but they could have portrayed their roles in a more Hollywood-style fashion and nobody would have realised. It is for this reason that I believe the actors are the hidden gem of this complicated maze of a picture. To conclude, Inception may be the most complex and engaging films you see all year, and if you focus purely on the movie itself and don't get distracted, it should be the best too. To me, Inception is Nolan's masterpiece and serves as a much needed kick-up-the-arse to the likes of Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich. This is how you make a movie boys... start taking notes!10/10"
119237,False,"The problem with this movie is that the plot is too convoluted, thus diverting attention away from the movie's basic premise, that of how the brain functions during sleep. This is a fascinating, esoteric subject but like all fascinating subjects, when Hollywood gets a hold of it, look out! You may be in for a ride, to a place we know not where. A story works best when it has a beginning, a middle and and end. When you tamper with that structure, such as by starting a movie with a flashback, you're inviting confusion and frankly, who wants to go to the movies to be confused. Stories should be told straightforwardly, but that is not the case with this movie. Is Mr. DiCaprio in a dream or not? After a while, it becomes a moot point as the movie just keeps rambling on and on to its inevitable conclusion. Nevertheless, the movie does explore some interesting subjects such as idea formation, mind manipulation, the subconscious and mental activity during sleep. Where the movie stalls is in plausibility and structure. Yet, despite these drawbacks, the movie is worth watching because of Leonardo DiCaprio who once again gives an excellent performance as a stalwart yet troubled mind prober. He carries the movie which alone makes it watchable. Once again Hollywood has taken a perfectly good idea for a movie and has watered it down. Brainwashing is a fascinating subject. It is a key element in The Manchurian Candidate. How do we know that our ideas are actually ours and not planted into our heads? That is the underlying theme of this movie. The problem is, the story itself is so muddled and confusing that at times it becomes a distraction. Leonardi DiCaprio is excellent as a mind prober with emotional issues which get in the way of doing his job. The premise of the story is interesting , especially as it relates to questions of consciousness and unconsciousness and the formulation of ideas during sleep. But then the movie loses focus as the DiCaprio character gets more and more hung up on his emotional problems, thus diverting attention away from the movie's original premise. However, this is a good movie and is worth watching but with this disclaimer: it may put you to sleep."
119238,False,"A DVD CHOICE, NOT A MOVIE THEATER CHOICE: First, allow me to say as an avid movie buff of 40 years, I have seen many flicks over the years, my tastes are varied, and I am the first to love something that will take you away from your world, into the world of a writer/director. That being said, it is of the utmost importance for me to be led, in a movie, to a point of intrigue, and visuals are of an equal importance as dialog when and where it comes to suspense. If not, the film is heavily reliant on a pretty, well known face, to keep your interest, while the flick drags on, with little relevant reason beyond verbal dribble to stay in your seat. There WERE a solid 5 or so minutes of effects, but the trailer leads you to believe there were much more. This flick allowed 90% verbal plot-building to create somewhat of a lack of suspense, a you-had-to-be-there, in my eyes, to drag a viewer into interest. Zero character building left it with a lack of relevance. I watched a surprising amount of people walk out of the theater, and more than I have ever seen leaving and coming back. They bought their ticket, but for some reason they weren't inclined to be pinned to the screen. I heard many utter the very same thing I was thinking, along with my date, while departing the theater... after 25 mins you are pretty much like what the heck is going on- I think we all followed along with the ""story"" as best we could, but the dead honest truth is that the first 10-20 mins are what creates an air of either interest, or turnoff... and INCEPTION left me with a lack of interest, either through writing and/or direction, that lasted throughout the 2.5 hours this movie dragged on. It was OK, but as my lady is saying beside me, you kept wishing through the first parts, for an ""ah!"" moment, then what came through more as confusing didn't ever seem to make up for that yearning, and judging from the reactions overheard when we were leaving, we were not alone in our assessment. Shortly, too many questions, not enough answers. WAIT FOR VIDEO, THEN PLAN ON REWINDING A FEW TIMES AND TAKING QUITE A FEW BREAKS TO PROCESS WHAT IS GOING THROUGH THE SEMI-BEWILDERED WRITER'S MIND."
119239,False,"After reading up on the initial reviews before it premiered and watching the trailers, I expected a great movie. What I saw was a movie with a very interesting concept but for some reason there was a lot of action that was totally irrelevant for the story. I was mostly irritated about all the shooting and action since it did nothing but prolong the movie. In the end the movie has an interesting concept that gets mixed in with James Bond and all other action movies you can think of and it just feels like a total waste of time to go see this film. It is neither a good action movie nor a movie with a believable story. The movie just is not interesting and it does not feel unique.Go see something else!"
119240,False,"This is a breathtaking science fiction film to watch and its 2 hours 20 minutes sped by for me. Even if it borrowed a lot from Matrix, Orphee, even Kane at the climax, and others, it was so confident and assured in the depiction and dissection of its nonsense world I couldn't help but be very impressed. So what if the plot apparently bulges with Real World non sequiteurs and Dream World paradoxes  as recommended to a character in the film (and by Cocteau in Belle Et La Bete) we have to take a leap of faith. It's why so many people believe in a God.A team of mind altering thieves (Extractors) are recruited and hired by a billionaire capitalist to plant an idea via dreams (Inception) in a rival billionaire capitalist's mind to break up his empire and thus preserve profit margins. As you might or might not imagine it's not so straightforward, leading to a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream and limbo  at least. The acting was good, however the characters were basically 2D and although DeCaprio's was fleshed out a little more I didn't empathise with any of them, but the plot was the thing after all! There's no compromise: it's tortuous to follow at times and relentlessly fast paced throughout  the first 10 minutes were incomprehensible to me but gradually it became as clear as mud, until even I saw the ending coming. My modern-film-savvy daughter was on hand to act as interpreter but we had to lean on each other and promise a re-view next year sometime. I would add that the actual process of putting people under was thankfully skipped over and Michael Caine's usual death-touches were blissfully brief.On first and second thoughts I recommend this as a film made in 2010 that has absolutely no swearing, no sex, not much violence, a ""realistic"" amount of cgi cartoonery, but a well made engrossing storyline instead."
119241,False,"Saw it in cinemas a week after opening night or so. I couldn't keep off the 8 vote though i feel its a bit high.Short about the movie before i review it. Cobb - the main character, played by Leonardo Di Caprio, is a former architect and accused for throwing his wife out the window - literally, is trying to clean his record with the police by doing a job for a powerful acquaintance(Ken Watanabe - Saito) that involves dreamexorcism and the like. While struggling with the mystic relationship with his former wife he puts together a team of specialists to handle the job. Ellen Page plays Ariadne, the gifted young architect. Tom Hardy plays Eames, the 'impersonator' if you will. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Arthur, in charge of the technical aspects. They are all there to trick Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) big time. By taking him through three levels of dreaming they hope to alter the very core of his motivation and change his future plans as a result. You will have the rest explained to you, don't worry about that.I've heard people saying they have to watch the movie 3-4 times before understanding the story in full. In my opinion you have almost everything explained to you just as it happens. This comes through in discussions among the characters or with the camera itself. To clarify, if you have to think about something for a moment because you didn't understand it fully the characters in the movie interrupts your thought process by explaining exactly what just happened. I don't mean to sound arrogant at all but I have this problem with movies that tries to reach out to everyone at once. If the aim is to include every watcher they obviously have to explain things over and over in different ways. I totally get that but it doesn't fit well with a movie like this one, it takes all the thought provocation and mysticism out.I don't know if it was the overall Hollywood-humorous-mood of the movie that made it difficult for me to take the characters seriously or if it was just poor portraiting from the actors. It seemed more of a kindergarten with Leonardo, the grownup, running around trying to calm down the kids - Ellen and Joseph. More of a Harry Potter cast feeling to it Im afraid. Im also disappointed to say that Leo had his worst performance in a long time, if not ever. I'd think the manuscript was aiming for a very emotionally moving struggle for the main character. However Cobbs little misadventures wasn't moving me one inch. Leos acting felt empty and almost fake.Nolan tries to feed the watcher with a bit of everything, romance, humour, action, sci-fi and psychology all at the same time but falls short in every area. The actionscenes and animations are great though, in line with almost all new movies from Hollywood these days. This to me unfortunately makes Inception more of a hardcore actionmovie than the thought provoking masterpiece I was hoping for.Now if you are one not particularly annoyed by areas discussed above you wont be disappointed with Inception, you wont be anyway. The ideas behind it are new, very interesting and thought provoking. I think people will start investigating and experimenting with their dreams just a bit more after seeing Inception.I know I do, and I like it :)"
119242,False,"I know that my review will be lost between the hundreds and hundreds, but i couldn't stop myself from writing this. Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed this movie from start to end, and there were some things that i didn't quite understand, some were about the plot, but most of them were about the movie itself. I mean that i have a different perception to what dreams are and watched parts of the film with just a little bit of anxiety (something i had never felt), wishing for something else to happen. But i'm getting ahead of myself.First of all let me say that i made a mistake when i decided to watch this movie with some of my friends. Apparently, they didn't take it as seriously as i did, because i kept hearing some giggles here and there, they would find things that they considered highly funny and go off about it, and they weren't the only ones there, some other people were doing the same. I didn't care to shut them up because i didn't want to distract myself, not even for one second. This is a movie you have to watch with lots of attention, because there are parts where so much information is shared or so much things are revealed, that you might miss some. That's why it's recommended that you pay attention to it and, if you need it, watch it again.One of the points that made me like this movie so much was its tremendous cast. Everybody played their part perfectly, flawless. I have to admit that i'm not a big fan of Leonardo, i've never really felt him in any movie, but i have got to say that i respect his work, and after watching this movie, i'm sure he will be remembered as one of the best. Not just for this film, but for the rest of them.The plot is original, fresh, well in other words, Nolan at his best. He has achieved the kind of story that i'm attracted to: a story with so much to see, so much to experience, so much to feel, that it's actually hard to understand. And at the end, it left me thinking about it over and over. But i just expected a bit more about the dreams. At least for me, they weren't dreams exactly, they were just an approach. I won't go deep into this because i don't want to spoil anything, i'll just say that i needed just a bit more.This is a movie to be remembered, i think it's to high on the top 250, but still, it really deserves to be there. You won't regret watching this film, it is wonderful. And, by the way, i've only watched it once, so all the little questions that i had by the end of the movie will be solved (i hope so) when i see it for the second time. And i expect some Oscars for this movie. Enjoy!"
119243,False,"I was very excited to watch this movie, as i sat and watched these losers go to all this trouble to do some pointless mission, when they could have easily solved all this without going in someones dream. I just thought the Whole movie was over the top and i didn't care about any of the characters and o wanted them all to die, especially Juno. The story was stupid, no character development, everyone is afraid to say that this movie is boring and that people are still obsessed with that moronic dark knight movie. I think that if people would stop being so dazzled by special effects and watched the movie for what it really is they would see its just stupid and boring. If he knew how to make a good movie he would make it shorter. My main problem was that it was long, and everyone in it was acting poorly."
119244,False,"This is one of the most hyped-up films in recent memory and I feel exactly the same way after I saw The Hurt Locker. Don't believe the hype - make up your own mind. I am a fan of Christopher Noland and DiCaprio and think Juno with Ellen Page is one of the most original films I have ever seen with her outstanding performance. But Inception is, please excuse my language, simply a gargantuan piece of crap. Illogical plot, weak acting, a plethora of unnecessary, distracting violence - the film never did it for me. After less than an hour I wanted to leave the movie theater, were it not for a niece evening with my wife in the unique and great Moolah theater in St. Louis. Simply disappointing and I just cannot believe what I read in the other reviews. Did you see the same movie?? Did you write up what you wanted to see or what you actually saw? Number #3 on the list of all-time greatest films?? Give me a break."
119245,False,"It seems like Leonardo DiCaprio is really going for these Psychological thrillers lately, which is good, as he seems to pull it off quite nicely.As usual, Christofer Nolan has created another great movie which is well shot, superbly acted and grips your attention from scene 1 - although at that point you really have no idea what is going on! My one point of criticism on an otherwise amazing movie is that he takes the concept one step too far. Towards the end keeping up with what's happening where becomes a full time task and although I don't want to come over as stupid, one less would have made the film flow much smoother.Enjoy!"
119246,False,"If Avatar raised the bar high with its stupendous technical accomplishment, then Inception has set the bar even higher with its technical brilliance intertwined with a story that keeps you riveted to your seats till the end. Where Avatar missed out with its otherwise bland storyline, Inception has delivered and how! ''An idea can transform the world'' - the perfectionist Christopher Nolan's unique idea about dreams materialized into Inception and has transformed the very notion of a 'movie'. Nolan, who leaves no stone unturned in hunting out the perfect actors in his films does not make an exception here. Known for bringing out the most engrossing performances from his cast, the vintage Nolan has once again succeeded in making his actors give such effortless executions of their roles thus orchestrating into one of the most intriguing movies ever made.True to Nolan style, Inception keeps you guessing with its thrills and spins, the delicate intricacies that make perfect use of your mind and the engaging visuals that never leave even a single minute boring. One of the most original scripts written by Nolan with fantastic dialogues, the mind-boggling multi-layered film simply entices you with its breathtaking cinematography and superb special effects.You can feel yourself sharing the dreams of the extractors as Dom Cobb, the master extractor goes on stealing ideas from the human mind by sharing dreams. You can feel his emotions as his belief torments his soul and Ariadne's anxiety that his personal pain might actually bring about the downfall of their entire mission. If the movie's first half enchants you with its charm then the second half simply blows your mind. For the first half is the basic lead-up to the actual process of inception shown in the second half, which Dom Cobb takes up as a challenge which would aid him to return to his children.And there lies the multi-layered dream fantasy, a dream within a dream - something you have never seen before. And each layer is executed with such impeccability and intelligence that you cannot help taking your eye off the screen for even a single second.And to top it all Hans Zimmer's association with the movie brings out the best in every scene with his brilliant score.Over the years Leonardo Di Caprio has grown even better as an actor and his latest offering of Cobb, the corporate spy with a tortured mind might finally be enough for an Oscar breakthrough. Ellen Page as the prodigious architect, Ariadne and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Cobb's team member, Arthur deliver impressive performances. Ken Watanabe's portrayal of a cunning businessman was absolutely just what the movie required. Tom Hardy as the witty forger, Eames and Cilian Murphy as the heir, Fischer Jr with hidden emotions do a commendable job. Last but not the least, Marion Cotillard was haunting and bewitching in her small role as Cobb's deceased wife, Mal who appears in his subconscious.This is by far Nolan's best offering till date. While a single viewing might not be enough to grasp the film entirely, its grandeur will simply mesmerize the audience and cover up any flaw, if it really has any. If Memento, The Prestige and The Dark Knight raised the bar of expectations, then Nolan has simply exceeded those expectations with Inception and makes himself an absolutely compelling candidate for the Academy Awards!"
119247,False,"Christopher Nolan has made a career out of constructing genre-defying, non-linear narratives that stem from a simple idea, often involved with the mind; short-term memory loss in Memento; the lack of sleep in Insomnia's case; magic trickery in The Prestige's. Creating a world that switches time-frames is something Christopher Nolan enjoys to do, which has been example since his 1998 debut Following. Extending his talents to creating his own Gotham city for the reinvention of the Batman franchise (Batman Begins and The Dark Knight respectively) meant that Nolan went big budget  yet throughout his high octane charge, he retained the complexity that sets him aside from the rest. Inception is a blend of Memento's ingenuity and The Dark Knight's action amped up to the maximum.To give away the plot of Inception would be to detract from half the fun; enter the cinema knowing as little as possible. It is important to note that it is not an easy watch, yet it is not a difficult one either. It is mesmerising and will most definitely take multiple views to fully grasp. That's not to say that you won't appreciate Inception on first view. If you enter the film's world  be it real or dream  it is potentially, depending on where the characters are and which characters are present  extremely exciting, tense at times, terrifying. Don't know what I'm talking about? You will. Immersing yourself is a rewarding experience that will ease the complexity the storyline can't help but offer. Think of three versions of Memento taking place simultaneously (which isn't far off the mark); as you can imagine, there's no room for toilet breaks here.Christopher Nolan  who takes sole writing credit here, as well as director  has managed to craft a perfect depiction of dream worlds, which exist in his own landscape. It is clear that this is a story close to his heart and one that he has branched out over many years (when pitched to the studio, he believed the script would only take 6 months to write; in truth, it took him 8 years). This is Nolan's universe and it is to his credit that he pulls the plot's several strands into one cohesive whole by the film's climax - not only into a whole that makes sense, but one that satisfies also: an almost impossible task for any filmmaker. Not to lay all of the credit on his shoulders, it should be noted that this is as much the cast's film as it is the directors. Ellen Page sparkles as Ariadne, a role that doesn't offer a lot; her dialogue is limited to exposition present to enable the audience to understand what the hell is going on, but yet it never explicitly feels this way (which indirectly praises back Nolan's original screenplay). Joseph Gordon-Levitt continues to establish himself as a strong talent as Arthur, who shares a few comedic moments with Eames, portrayed by an equally impressive Tom Hardy. The remainder of the cast  a memorable Marion De Cotillard, and now Nolan stalwarts Ken Watanabe and Cillian Murphy, the latter who provides an unexpectedly touching performance  are all fine and help make the film what it is in their own way. But this is Leonardo DiCaprio's for the taking who further solidifies why he is being hailed 'the new De Niro'. The emotion at the centre of Nolan's script is the fuel that keeps this fire burning and without DiCaprio's anguish and drive, the film would have very much suffered. Dom Cobb has a history that needs to be explored, and Leo is the guy to guide us through these multi-layered worlds where a freight train could burst through the streets at any given time.The idea of dreams and planting or extracting thoughts from people through the medium of sleep is one that has interested Christopher Nolan for a long time. His interest in the mind has turned out to be an infectious one and this is achieved through his honed technique of shedding his plot in a 'normal' light. He makes the unimaginable imaginable; inconceivable conceivable. By balancing intellect alongside spectacle in a summer blockbuster is a genius way of providing something for everyone. Nolan fans will be as equally impressed as fans of gunshots and car chases. Although the film won't be to everyone's tastes (lose focus for more than a minute and you'll be in trouble) it is certain that everyone shall appreciate the genius that has gone into crafting Inception and will marvel at the world that has been constructed. Inception is no doubt an impossibly audacious film and one that engrosses from start to end. In a summer of remakes, sequels and reinventions, Inception is the breath of fresh air that rarely comes around; a breath of fresh air that screams out 'modern classic'. Visually breathtaking (two words: zero gravity) and intensely clever, Inception delivers consistently on every level there is and I for one am not surprised.VERDICT: Upon exploring Nolan's universe where anything is possible, you will leave the cinema wondering in many ways if you are dreaming or not. Spectacular, breathtaking and plenty of room for theorisation, Inception is the ultimate lucid dream. Christopher Nolan really is the filmmaker of our generation: roll on Batman 3.Cobb: Dreams feel real when we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realise something was strange."
119248,False,"Inception, directed by Christopher Nolan, is a film that asks of its audience to participate in its unraveling. You don't just settle into your seat and 'watch' this film as an ordinary spectator; you sit there and carefully work it out, piece by tricky piece. If most films, by very definition, are made in order to entertain or engage viewers, Inception does more than that: it challenges them.Not that you should expect any less from the director that gave us the deliciously complicated Memento and the cerebral blockbuster that was The Dark Knight. With Inception, Nolan fuses the core agendas of both those previous films -- he is delivering a spectacle, but to enjoy it completely the audience must earn it.Indeed Inception requires that you submit your full attention. The film is part sci-fi, part heist thriller, and part mind-bending psychological puzzle. And chances are you're going to need to watch it at least a second time to grasp exactly what is going on.Let me lay out the basics: Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Dom Cobb, a master thief-for-hire trained to extract information from a sleeping person's brain. He performs the job skillfully, but lands his toughest challenge when he's hired by a powerful businessman, Saito (played by Ken Watanabe) to plant an idea in a rival's head, instead of stealing one. The idea when planted, will cause Saito's business rival Robert Fischer (played by Cillian Murphy) to break up his father's multimillion-dollar empire.Dom sets out to accomplish the job with a faithful team that comprises his longtime right-hand man (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a 'forger' who can morph into another person's identity (played by Tom Hardy), a scientist who supplies the sedative needed to put the victims and the extractors into a slumber (played by Dileep Rao), and an architect who designs mazes for the dream world (played by Ellen Page). It doesn't help however, that Dom is haunted by the memory of his dead wife Mal (played by Marion Cotillard), who has the irritating habit of showing up in his subconscious and messing with his mind while he's at work.Much of the film's first hour is spent illustrating how Dom's job works: how he extracts dreams and ideas from people's heads, and what exactly the process involves. You're introduced to the concept of multiple levels and layers within the subconscious (meaning dreams within dreams within dreams), and you're familiarized with the rules by which this virtual-reality world works -- such as what happens if you die in a dream, the nature of dream time v/s real time, and the dangers of layering elaborate dreams within dreams.As a viewer it takes time to arrive on the same page as the characters, and just when you think you've figured it out, you find yourself flummoxed again by all the drama and action unfolding within parallel dream states.Visually, Inception is a jaw-dropping marvel if you consider the manner in which Nolan blurs the real with the surreal, without ever going all Alice in Wonderland on us. Watch the scene in which the city of Paris folds in on itself like a book, or the one in which Gordon-Levitt gets into a gravity-defying duel with a bunch of bad guys in a hotel corridor. Using minimal CGI to execute the audacious stunts, Nolan keeps the dreams grounded in plausibility.There is no shortage of high-adrenalin action either, which is delivered in that breathless foot-chase sequence through the streets of Tangiers, a scene that seems as if it's been pulled straight out of a Jason Bourne movie.The ensemble cast dives into the film's challenging narrative and delivers credible performances across the board, although special mention has to be made of Joseph Gordon-Levitt who creates a composed, confident character that is a clever foil to DiCaprio's Dom Cobb.As the leader of the pack, the protagonist of this drama, Leonardo DiCaprio is first-rate. He brings genuine emotion to the scenes in which we see Cobb overwhelmed with love for his wife and children, and he is every bit as convincing in his action star avatar. For DiCaprio Inception stands as a companion piece to Shutter Island in which he also played a widower at the mercy of dark illusions.Ultimately the film works because it keeps you on your toes throughout. There is excitement to be had in the struggle to keep up with what's going on, and in the end if you feel like there's a lot that went over your head, well, join the club! If you thought Memento was confusing, wait till you sink your teeth into Inception. I'm going with 10 out of 10 for Christopher Nolan's Inception. It's the most original film I've seen in long time. A masterstroke of writing and storytelling. At roughly two hours and thirty minutes it leaves you exhausted, but in a good way."
119249,False,"Trying to post a review of this movie is almost impossible; something akin to remaking Godfather all over again. It would be an insult to the genius that is Christopher Nolan. I was bewitched from start to finish, from all possible perspectives be it story, screenplay, camera, music, acting - everything under the sun that is put into making a movie of this brilliance.Dom Cobb is an extractor, a person who owns the ability to penetrate dreams and steal ideas. Hired by a Japanese tycoon, Saito, he assembles a crew with individual capabilities to aid him in the ultimate deception - inception. Inception is planting an idea as opposed to stealing an idea.The first half sets the speed and the concept. In fact the whole of the first part of the movie did what Matrix tried to do in three versions. It was complex, almost utter nonsense but believable and direct.It is in the second half that the complications start and the director explores all possibilities of the ground rules of the concept that he had just lain foundation to. The movie peaks and falls at the right times, with the climax bringing the ultimate reasoning behind it all - which is even more convoluted and has lead to multiple discussions.The one thing that struck me was that, all the actors are stellar ones, starting off with Leonardo Di Caprio, Joseph Gordon Lewitt, Ellen Page, Michael Caine and Marion Cotillard. But the fact remains, the director managed to outshine them all, easily, as if he was doing it in his dream.'Memento', 'Insomnia', 'The Dark Knight' and 'The Following' all seem to be leading up to this movie which has the traditional Nolan checklist of a non-linear narrative, intertwined plots, intelligent dialogues and enough action.A movie that balances entertainment and intelligence with heavy doses of either. I promise you, if you are watching it the first time, it definitely is not going to be your last."
119250,False,"Ever since inception is announced, everyone is excited. Because it is Nolan's immediate follow up to biggest summer blockbuster Dark knight. And it creates lot of buzz when its first trailer arrives. But for past two months, inception is vigorously marketed and got a wave of rave reviews keep people excited. But I am really worried because this much hype leads to unrealistic expectations (which resulted in critic's backlash). Finally inception arrives. Does it lives up to hype? I am more than glad to say yes. Inception is mind blooming original film which deals with carefully constructed dreams in a blockbuster scale, if you pay attention to the movie right from the start. If you are not willing to keep your brain in active, you could easily lose the plot of the movie and you have to settle for a dumb action movie. Having said that, let's focus on the film (I am not going into movie's plot). The film lives up to its tagline, the dream is real. Nolan somehow managed to give the real version of dreams. The plot is not confusing it seems, only the narration makes it complex (like other Nolan films). But if you watch carefully it's not that hard to follow (though final act blows your mind). Yes, it is a heist film and not a typical blockbuster movie. But it had some great action sequences which does make perfect sense to the movie. Paris folding scene and gravity defying scene are still dazzling my mind, begging me for repeated viewings. And the logic behind the no  gravity scene is even more dazzling. Cast: It's an all star cast and everyone plays their character with purpose. The leading man, Leonardo Dicaprio as Cobb. He was the core of the film. His emotions are backbone of the narration. He pulls this complex character with such ease. When it comes to emotional characters, it felts like he was born to play these characters (watch Shutter Island). Cobb's right hand is Joseph Gordon-Levitt. His acting skills are improving with every film. He makes zero gravity scene even more realistic. Ellen page, she does her role to near perfection. Sure there is much more to come from this young and talented actress. Tom hardy is the really the scene stealer with his spontaneous one liners and gave this film much needed charm. Though his accent is difficult to follow, Ken Watanabe is good enough for his role. Cillian Murphy has little to do, but still impress. Michael caine has very little screen space to make any impact. Martin cotillard is awesome. She is pretty at times, terrifying sometimes and also gets sympathy. One of the memorable performance in recent years (considering very less screen space for her in the movie), definitely an Oscar nod for best supporting actress. Hans zimmer's score is original and the best of his combination with Nolan till now. His score adds much needed suspense and mystery to the film. Likewise CGI works almost looks real. It seems like Wally Pfister exactly understands what Nolan wanted. Though the movie is nearly 2 ½ hours, not even single frame is wasted. Kudos to the editing team. Overall: A comparison with matrix is inevitable. But inception is purely Nolan's original idea constructed in his own way of narration. And of course like other Nolan films, inception is opened to lot of interpretations. This is a rare and most original blockbuster you have ever seen. Nolan has outdone himself once again. Overall inception is a movie which will blow your mind and also provides a visual treats to the viewers. Inception is much more than what I reviewed. Go, see it. It confuses and dazzles your mind in a good fashion. I am sure you will be urged for multiple viewings. My points: 10/10."
119251,False,"Having seen the trailers for the past several weeks I was planning to see it but I was certainly not excited about it. The next 2 1/2 hours flew by with a movie that entertained like a big budget movie and challenged the mind like a small ""indie"" flick. As I tried to figure out exactly what happened (which of course will be my opinion since this is the kind of movie that will be open to hundreds of interpretations) I realized I needed to give it another look so I went back the next day and watched it again. I noticed a few slight ""flaws"" the second time through but these were small details that can be rationalized depending on your point of view as to what the movie really was about. Is this a all a dream? Is it real and everything went as planned? Are portions real and the end a dream? There will be countless debate on this and we know Mr. Nolan will never tell. What I do know after this and the sensational ""Dark Knight"" I am now in the ""Christopher Nolan is far and away the most creative person in the film industry"" camp. I strongly recommend to everyone - go see this and form your own conclusions - this movie does not preach, but just entertains and challenges. The best movie in years - nothing has been close!"
119252,False,"i saw this movie yesterday.it was mind blowing.i went with some great expectations and this movie surpassed my expectations.the screenplay was awesome and the cast was excellent.some brilliant performances by actors like Dicaprio,levitt and Ellen page had made this movie a 2011 Oscar contender.the first half of the movie was a bit slow but the second half gained pace and was mind blowing.Nolan deserves Oscar for creating this masterpiece.am sure that this movie will be the no.1 contender for 2011 Oscars..hope this movie gets many Oscars. thanks to Nolan for giving this wonderful movie.. i give this movie a 10/10...nolan u rock........."
119253,False,"Inception is a viscerally breathtaking, emotionally engaging, thought provoking, preposterous but at the same time ingenious creation from the mind of one of the most creative, talented and amazing directors existing today, Christopher Nolan, who has also directed other great movies such as ""The Dark Knight"", ""Batman Begins"", ""The Prestige"" and ""Memento"". It is an impenetrable, lucid and psychologically complex investigation into the various layers of the sub-conscious dream state, combined with some amazing, fascinating and spectacular action set-pieces with superb special effects. The multi-layered labyrinthine plot may be too obscure to comprehend at the first viewing and requires subsequent multiple viewings with great concentration to fully grasp and decipher this engaging, bold, complicated and often intentionally ambiguous plot. The Cast and their performances are superb, spearheaded once again by Leonardo Di Caprio who is fast transforming into one of the greatest actors of this generation, aptly supported by Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Marion Cottilard, Ken Watanabe & Dileep Rao. Also, brilliant cameo performances by Michael Caine & Tom Berenger helps to transcend this captivating movie into greater heights. The superb cinematography by Wally Pfitser and the sublime music by Hans Zimmer is spot on and blends nicely with the overall feel and atmosphere of this movie, adding to the spectacle. I don't want to go into the specifics of the plot for its best to watch this movie with absolutely no idea about it, the way Nolan wanted it to be. Still the basic outline consists of this: Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a master thief with a shady past who specializes in breaking into people's dreams and stealing their ideas, is given an opportunity by a mysterious businessman Saito (Ken Watanabe) to redeem everything he's ever done, and in the process reunite with the children he left in the U.S. when he was forced for shady reasons to flee the country. Saito's offer includes completing an impossible mission, for which Cobb must assemble the best team ever compiled for such a mission. Saito's particular offer involves planting an idea in the head of the heir (Cillian Murphy) of his greatest rival (Pete Postelthwaite), a process called ""inception"". The rest of the movie is up to the audience to watch, grasp, enjoy and interpret, especially the conclusion which is one of the most interesting, innovative and original ""open to interpretation"" ending that is sure to keep many viewers mesmerized and bewildered for days and weeks after the initial viewing. Finally, In a nutshell, this without a shadow of a doubt is the greatest achievement in movie-making in the year 2010 and it firmly deserves all the accolades, plaudits and honours it will receive in the future. Definitely a must watch for movie buffs, this future ""Oscar contender"" will most certainly provide all the audiences with a ""Riveting, once in a lifetime, roller coaster ride"" experience that must not be missed for anything else in the world."
119254,False,"In director Christopher Nolan's Inception, each of the dream-spelunking characters carries a totem, a personalised object used to differentiate reality from the world of dreams. A loaded six-sided die, a custom-made chess piece. Doesn't matter. Just so long as it works. Otherwise, they could end up stuck in a kind of limbo, forever blurring the razor-thin line between truth and dream.Audience-goers would be wise to carry similar reminders of the real world because Inception is a wild, enjoyable ride into surrealism, and ends up feeling much longer than its hefty 148-minute run-time.The British-American filmmaker has long toyed with issues of consciousness and memory, and the intense psychological aspects of love and pain. Inception ties together the various threads of his career, in what amounts to his most ambitious work yet.Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio [ Images ]) is a security agent of the most unconventional kind -- he guards people's subconscious thoughts. Wealthy clients pay him to ensure their dreams remain uncompromised, since the dream realm is where we all hide our deepest, most valuable secrets.Cobb, an expert in dream extraction, also pilfers ideas from his clients on the side. He hates to live so unscrupulously but he's running from a horrific incident in his past that leaves him unable to return home to his family and work a normal job.Now, suddenly, a wealthy Japanese client, Saito (Ken Watanabe), is willing to grant Cobb his ultimate freedom, so that he can be reconnected with his children. All he must do in return is something infinitely more difficult than dream extraction: dream inception. Specifically, he must plant an idea in the head of the heir to the world's largest energy fortune, an idea that will allow Saito's own business empire to thrive. But dream inception requires not just a dream-state, or a dream-within-a-dream state, but a dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream state. Not easy.To do this, he recruits a team of veteran dream thieves, along with a precocious young architect (Ellen Page [ Images ]), and sets about entering the mind of the heir (Cillian Murphy) during a cross-Atlantic flight. But just 10 hours, you say? That can't be enough time to implant an idea in someone's head? Ahh, but in Nolan's dream world, one hour of real-time is like 10 hours of dream-time. And one hour of dream-time is like 10 hours of dream-within-a-dream time.From there, things get tricky for our thieves, as layers upon layers of dreams start piling up, and the integrity of the dream system they've created becomes increasingly fragile, with potentially devastating effects.Things get even trickier for Nolan, as he works hard to bring his five-story fugato to a harmonious close. It's glorious and entertaining, but far too busy, and still ends up slightly incoherent.In interviews, Nolan says he's been developing the idea behind Inception since he was 16 years old. Like a personal dream, he's kept it close to him, where it's incubated through all these years of career success and growth.To be clear, that idea is amazing, the product of a capable, fertile mind. But like all dreams, the vision seems to have been hard for Nolan to reproduce and convey while still making sense. That's Inception itself: a breath-taking kaleidoscope of fractured, fragmented emotions, thoughts and images, but with a few loose ends here and there.Another problem is that, at times, the film feels like it's been neatly cleaved in two -- the story about Cobb and his wife, and the larger heist story. While the narrative works to bring the two together, they each could possibly serve as the basis of separate films.Inception should receive best film and best director nominations for the Academy Awards. Deservedly.As for individual awards, it's hard to imagine Leonardo not being recognised for such a fine performance. While the rest of the cast performs as expected, it must be said that Ellen Page disappoints as the architect student. The character's just a bit too flippant and immature.The visuals are first class, and Nolan has convincingly played around with things as fundamental to our universe as gravity and time, all without relying too heavily on CGI.Forget the hype machine and the mega-million marketing campaign, and what you're left with is an entertaining, intelligent film. Perhaps in its execution, Inception doesn't truly do justice to the incredible concept driving it. But it's a fantastic effort all the same, and a sure-fire blockbuster.download movie from http://movieez4u.blogspot.com/"
119255,False,"Well, the trailers, the reviews had my anticipation going before I watched the movie. However, the expectations were tower high as Chris Nolan is one of my favorite directors and Leo is my favorite star. I prefer never to miss his movies.Merits First : Story , Screenplay and Direction : 10/10 ,Direction was consistent in all the places, didn't feel continuity errors, Story and Screenplay were so engaging that involved the viewers at every point in the movie, challenges them and leaves them enthralled, confused , wanting for more.CGI / Special Effects : 8/10 , Got patchy in a couple of places,specially the Paris Cafe Scene.Acting : 10/10 Totally Blown away by the performances of Leo, Ellen Page , Joseph Gorden Lewitt , Tom Hardy are exceptionally good .Technicals , Cinematography , Casting : 10/10 Nolan just paints the canvas with beautiful dreams and subconsciousness of people.Background Score needs a special mention as it adds to the mood of the film.Inception is the story of Dom Cobb(Leo) and his team of ""Extractors"" , who deal with a special kind of security called subconscious security. They enter the dreams of subjects, extract their secrets from the dreams. Cobb is a fugitive of American government and corporates. He stays in Japan and want to get back to his family. A Powerful Japanese client offers him a deal to give his life back in return for his life and lift all the bans on him in return for planting an idea in his competitor's mind. Cobb decides to take a ""Leap of Faith"" and starts collecting his team for this. He meets Ariadne, a young and bright architect from his father's university , and Eames who leads him to Yusuf, a chemist with deep sleep sedatives. Together, they start working on the mission to plant the dream in Fischer Jrs Idea.No spoiler's here I will not reveal anything from suspense but on a whole the movie deserves a standing ovation as execution of such a script is a very difficult task, Nolan has handled it quite efficiently. The anti-gravity scenes were too good. The cinematography , the creation of dream worlds , the concept of architects were so good that you can believe that the time required to build the script and its depth took 10 years and the movie was pitched to the producers just after memento."
119256,False,"Inception is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, and surprisingly most of my favorites are directed by Christopher Nolan, starting with Memento till Dark Knight I am huge fan and Inception is no exception, its is a master piece, and I know just like other movies of Christopher Nolan this one will be considered as one of the top movies of all time.Inception is a story of inception of a thought in someone's mind and believe me everyone who is going to watch this movie will have an idea actually in there minds as well, I have the same kind of felling when I watched Memento, this movie creates effects like the same, the strange felling of watching something new or unique.Been waiting for this movie for almost 7 months now, biggest movie of the year and I am sure will win all the awards at the Oscars and another place where it will be nominated.Christopher Nolan is quite amazing , he told such a complex story in just 2 hrs, if Matrix's Brothers were have to same kind of thing, they would have taken 3 movies to tell the same story, it just Nolan who can manage such a complex story to be tolled in just one movie, Oh wow what an experience, I hope Christopher Nolan will make a sequel or prequel of the same with same brilliance.Must watch for everyone, and should watch it for more than once.Thanx AB"
119257,False,"I just came out of a movie theater. I am very shocked by this movie. Dark Knight was super incredible but it is amazing how a guy can produce another equally amazing master piece.Story, acting, directing are all rock solid. Carrying such a complicated story can turn out to be a disaster but Christoper Nolan has a perfect control over the progress of story.He plays the audiences' mind in a high level and never fails to lose the composure and intensity of the story through the entire running time. To that such an intense and emotional story, he also inserted appropriate amt of humor to provide some relaxations.All the CG is wisely used and provides jaw dropping experiences.Acting wise, Leonardo Diccaprio does what he does basically providing his overall great acting. All the others are also superbly casted. Especially the guy from 500 Summer is better than I expected. He looks serious enough and does provide some funny moments.Again, I am very impressed with what Christoper Nolan pulled off. In my opinion, he is actually becoming one of those legendary directors such as Hitchcock. Nolan got famous for stories dealing Human's psychology. This is another those stories but in a gigantic scale.Usually many directors fail to produce good movies with a lot of money but this Christopher Nolan has no limitations. he did that in Dark Knight and also in this movie, 'Inception'.I look forward to seeing his next possibly masterpiece film."
119258,False,"This film surpassed every expectation I had when I walked into the theatre. Not only was the acting brilliant, the story superb, and just the overall concept and execution flawless, but I left the theatre completely mind blown. I left in a state of wonder, a state that I have yet to come out of even though it has been 8 hours since seeing it.""Inception"" has caused me to ponder the nature of dreams and reality, made me just sit down and think, something so many films nowadays do not do. I am 16, and I am disappointed at how so many films do not strive to be anything special now. The main aim is to pull in as much money in the box office as possible. James Cameron is even re-releasing ""Titanic"" in 3-D and I am dying to know why? What is the need? More money?! However Nolan's ""Inception"" was simply exquisite in every possible way. It contained romance, comedy, suspense, fantasy, reality, and anything else you could ask for. There are going to be the reviewers that say this movie was too confusing, or that it was nowhere near as good as everyone is making it out to be, but I implore each and every one of you to go see this movie and make the decision for yourself. This is a film that more films need to strive to be like. Far too many of the films that have come out in the past ten years are lacking in one aspect or another, but ""Inception"" is truly a masterpiece."
119259,False,"Inception is one of the greatest movies of all times. The idea that you have in your mind before you watch Inception will be stolen by Christopher Nolan, the superb excellently talented director who keeps on blowing your mind from time to time. Leonardo DiCaprio is another charm of the movie, he will wake you up from your dreams of what you think or what you are thinking about the movie. The excellent idea of the movie, the story and everything else including the music by Hans Zimmer will shock you. Trust me you might have seen thousands of movies but this one is entirely different and better than 10,000 of those you haven't seen yet! Avatar is a movie to compare, well it was an experience but if you compare these two i would definitely go with INCEPTION. INCEPTION is a must watch. If you miss this one, you'll regret it forever! GO AND WATCH IT. I could only rate it 10 if there were 1000 stars for it i would click every star. Truly Amazing and its still running in my mind."
119260,False,"Nolan does it again and this time he knows he can get away with it! Inception is one of those mind numbing movies that demand a lot from the viewer and pushes the boundary of imagination. Dealing with dreams and memories is not something new for Hollywood(read matrix, esotsm, what dreams may come, cell etc) but where inception stands out is the brilliance that only Nolan can lend to the story and the execution. The visual effects, the acting, the cinematography, the story telling and more has just keen kicked up a notch! In many of his movies, the characters or say the protagonist is shown with a shortcoming or a secret that he/she needs to overcome and inception is no different! Di Caprio plays Cobb; a thief of a different kind who specializes in entering peoples dreams and extracting secrets. Fate has it that to overcome his fears and get back to his family, he is forced to perform inception, a dangerous process that involves planting new ideas into a subject after entering his/her dream. What follows is a complex and twisted story of dreams within dreams, blurred visions and powerful imagination.It is always important to weave a story no matter how complex around simple realities that are ""more"" human than what the story highlights. Nolan does it by focusing on Cobb and his psychological challenges of dealing with simple emotions like love, guilt and redemption. This is where the story becomes indulgent when we see the director trying hard to keep the audience rooted to the story but not often able to do so. Any artist can only go as far as his imagination takes him and cannot possibly predict the depths that the mind of his audience can reach. Nolan certainly pushes his imagination with Inception and teases his audience to do better. Inception might need more than one viewing to comprehend the hidden nuances but whatever be the case, the movie certainly leaves you grappling with your own dreams and realities. Surely a little self-indulgent but somehow, nobody seems to bother!ps: the movie ends in typical Nolan style but somehow one knows how it ends in ""his"" mind!"
119261,False,"While I risk angering everyone caught up in the fervor surrounding this film, I have to say that I was left unsatisfied. The visuals are great but Nolan simply tries to pack too much information into too long of a movie, and mediocre (at best) dialogue does not help to lift the story. As a stand alone idea the film is brilliant, but this idea is only bogged down by the writers and the limited room for the actors to explore their roles. First off, DiCaprio is acting in a role that is far too similar to his previous part in Shutter Island, and he has no room to show his acting talent as he is constrained to situations where he must look constipated with mental pain and answer the frustratingly dumb questions from Ariadne (Paige). (Is that supposed to be Adriane? Arachnid? I was never really sure why no one could have normal people names) This is in no way the fault of Paige, DiCaprio, or any of the others forced to conform to a script that sounded more like a cheesy Jerry Bruckheimer action film than the mental candy that it is being made out to look like. (Lines like ""assemble your team!"" come to mind) My biggest problem, though, is the seemingly infinite collection of small faults in logic, personality of characters, and setting. The viewer must take many leaps of faith, excusing many holes in the plot and the way the plot is constructed. Once one of these holes in uncovered, and it inevitably will, because you leave the theater thinking, all of the others suddenly become very apparent. None of the characters have a personality, they are simply there to do the bidding of Nolan; unexplained, and unmotivated. We have no connection to the setting (or any of the settings) because they have no importance to the story. These events could be happening anywhere, and the backdrop just seems like an excuse to say ""look! you're in a dream! did you know you're in a dream? what about now?"" With a confusing structure, poor script, inhuman characters, and no motivation for anything (the viewer is told when to be more interested by the booms from the soundtrack), Inception is an idea that has been polluted by the desire to create an awesome summer blockbuster. Nolan dances around his brilliant idea, which in itself drives this movie up to a 5/10, but he never touches it, and too afraid to ask one probing question to the audience with any sort of clarity, choosing instead to pose a plethora of confusing questions that only serve to dilute the films core; a center which it pains me to say is pure genius."
119262,False,"total crap... millions spent... Christoffer Nolan must be ashamed of himself... nobody should watch this movie.. take out your girlfriend for a dinner... or pay some hooker at least... drink all night.. i am thankful to God for not paying the ticket full price, because i am a student! god AlmightyAmerican movies are too stupid even for Americans... people, go watch Franch or British films, they represent art!Leonardo is fatter than ever, and his head is like a basketball, he acts like sh!t !overall the movie is stupid crap piece of sh!t..."
119263,False,It is probably just me since movies like The Matrix bore me to tears but I literally could barely stay awake during this nonsense. I am quickly coming to the conclusion that the Leonardo Di Caprio school of acting involves simply glowering and clenching his jaw during every scene. If you loved The Matrix you will probably like this but if you found The Matrix to be as boring as I did then you may want to avoid losing two hours of your life on this. Some of the computer graphics were compelling but this is strictly The Matrix from a different perspective and just as uninteresting. Go rent Fargo or some other decent movie and avoid wasting your time on this nonsense!
119264,False,"Seeing how Luis Bunuel (the master in the depiction of cinematic reveries) is my all-time favorite auteur, it goes without saying that I am fascinated by dream sequences in movies and the notion that INCEPTION was going to be an elaborate exploration of the dream-state in arty sci-fi/caper thriller terms was a potentially invigorating one. I must say that director Nolan assembled quite a remarkable cast here (even though it does feel sometimes like their names were ticked triumphantly off of a list of actors he has been wanting to work with): Leonardo Di Caprio, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page and Ken Watanabe (being the established ""heavyweights""); Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon Levitt and Dileep Rao (the up-and-coming ""new breed""); Tom Berenger, Lukas Haas and Pete Poslethwaite (the ""comeback"" crowd); plus Michael Caine and Cillian Murphy (from Nolan's own ""stock company""). All the actors rise deftly to the occasion but I would single out Cotillard (as Di Caprio's enigmatic dead wife who haunts him constantly), Gordon-Levitt and Hardy (as members of Di Caprio's elite theme of dream-stealers) for particular praise. Two equally impressive contributions to the film's overall success are Hans Zimmer's powerful score and some truly dazzling special visual effects (especially during the amazing 'folding city' sequence). Besides, for a typically (by today's standards) protracted 148-minute movie, it was a surprisingly fast ride.Now, as is perhaps my custom for contemporary fare, comes the barrage of reservations I had with the film which, in some people's minds, might disqualify the *** (i.e. good) rating above!: above all, I had a problem with the film's relentless desire to ""have the cake and eat it too"" by turning out what is, essentially, the cerebral version of the action-packed Summer blockbuster. The members of Di Caprio's team are supposed to be technological geeks but the extraordinary life-saving feats they accomplish in the movie (albeit only ever taking place in their subconscious) would make James Bond dive for his hat and pension cheque!; the latter's iconic presence is particularly recalled in the final snow-bound dream sequence that literally plays out like the 21st century version of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE (1969). I also found the gravity-defying flying antics of the hotel room set-piece hard to take and not a little silly (especially when Gordon-Levitt has to carry out his dormant companions on top of one another!)  and this is coming from somebody who has so far resisted the urge to watch (sacrilege of sacrileges) THE MATRIX trilogy. Again, I understand that most of what we see is supposed to be taking place in the dream-state but it felt pretty ridiculous to me to have six people all asleep at one time all the timeeven though every manner of bullet and bomb is exploding all around them! Amusingly, that enormously extended slow-motion shot of the van tumbling into the sea reminded me of Howard Hawks' (unjust in his case) denigrating comment on one of my all-time favorite Westerns i.e. Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH (1969)!On one hand, I am in awe of Christopher Nolan for having undertaken such a dauntingly complex task  creating a multi-layered maze of dreams within dreams  all by himself (even if it took him a good eight years to do so); on the other hand, however, I do not accept the fact that this should excuse several illogicalities that bugged me as I was watching it, namely: why would Di Caprio accept a newbie (albeit one as graceful as Page and who had been recommended to him by his father-in-law Caine) as part of the team for one final fling at his ultra-specialized job with an all-important outcome (reuniting him with his long-lost children)?; similarly, how on earth could a mere industrialist (Watanabe) nullify Di Caprio's murder charges by making one phone call?; what was the point of the team risking their lives repeatedly to discover the contents of Poslethwaite's vault when it has been telegraphed in advance (in that recurring photograph of Murphy as a boy) all along?  irresistible shades of CITIZEN KANE (1941)'s ""Rosebud"" climactic revelation perchance?; I am sure there was a rock-solid reason for Nolan and Zimmer to go for Edith Piaf's ""Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien"" anthem as the team's 'wake-up' tunebut the Cotillard connection made it seem far too deliberate. The one cardinal sin that the film commits, in my humble opinion, is that none of the dreams seemed the least bit dream-like to me! They are far too realistically realized and cleverly choreographed to ever attain the jumbled-up and repetitive nature of a true dream {sic}. Although one could easily tell whose dream we were in at any given point in time (since that character is virtually the protagonist in his own vision), I have to admit to losing sight of the stakes in some of them and, what is worse, I did not really care! Equally unimportant, it seems to me, was whether the totem would stop spinning, fall off the table or whatever in that 'not-all-that-unexpected' open ending!!"
119265,False,"First off, the people who complained Nolan's masterpiece, 'Memento', was too hard to follow are going to want to kill themselves trying to follow this one! This film is much like 'The Matrix Reloaded', all concept and no real climax or conclusion. Unlike The Matrix Reloaded, we don't already know there is going to be a sequel coming next summer. Leonardo DiCaprio is having the same issues we've already seen him deal with earlier this year in Scorsese's' brilliant 'Shutter Island'. It's Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character who is too cool and I would have liked to seen more of. Ellen Page is great and the best scenes where with her, I really would have liked to have followed her character around more, as she learns how to be a 'dream architect.'We get glimpses of awesomeness but there are too many things going on, all at once, for us as an audience, to put our emotions into. It's impossible to find yourself on the edge of your seat when a film has this much going on!'Inception' build and builds, introducing new concepts and ideas for so long that by the time the action begins, minds are already invested in trying to figure out how 'Inception' works instead of being fuelled with adrenaline to cheer on their favourite characters. Our minds are set on getting to the conclusion so we can figure everything out but the action sequences seem to never cease and we are torn between a deeply intense psychological thriller and a James Bond-like action flick.The people in the theatre with me did not leave happy or satisfied. They were tired, burnt-out and confused as hell. This is defiantly a movie strictly for Christopher Nolan's fans and lovers of 'The Matrix' sequels.The ideas are great but there are enough concepts here to make 3 films. It's too much for an audience to try and follow everything that Nolan has going on in this one single film AND actually feel something for his characters."
119266,False,"the thing which annoyed me most about this film is that it's taken as ""clever"" as some great philosophy which can make people think, as in ""wow mind blowing a dream within a dream within a dream wow!"" and also focuses a bit on lucid dreaming (being aware that you are asleep and able to control your dreams). However I found it annoying throughout the entire film that the ideas behind the film are fundamentally immensely incorrect.This was the same problem in the film the Matrix, the idea that the unconscious mind is a part of ""us"" and we can tap into it to control our world. It isn't a part of the individual ""us"", certainly not one which we have power over. We are our conscious selves, we're influenced by the unconsciousness, but we do not define ourselves by our unconsciousness and can't control it, we simply define ourselves as our conscious selves, our conscious thoughts, our sub-conscious influences our conscious mind. We can attempt to influence our sub-conscious with what we expose our consciousness to, but all of the general philosophy is incorrect in kind of egotistically assuming that ""we"" are the entirety of our minds including all unconscious aspects. This is the reason why the spoon bending in the matrix cant work in real life, even though many of the concepts of the matrix are correct, for example the idea that our consciousness is living in a world which is created sub-consciously, but we can't consciously manipulate this projected world and bend a spoon in half just for realising this, because it's not a projection of the consciousness but of the sub-conscious, so to try to consciously bend the spoon is out of our control, showing that the sub-conscious projection has superiority over the consciousness, in reality the consciousness can't demand the sub-conscious to change this projection no matter how hard we try. This is a major flaw in a lot of philosophical buddhist existentialism I have encountered. The inability to realise the humbling idea that we are symbiotic life forms, both physically and mentally, and that we consciously are not entirely in control but a fragment of the entirety.The same error occurs in Inception, the film mentions the unconscious mind frequently, it constantly presents the idea that every aspect of the mind entirely belongs to ourselves (in other words all belongs to the conscious part of the mind), rather than the correct idea that our minds are actually in many different parts, sub-conscious is perhaps a huge generalisation (it actually covers every aspect of the mind which is not our conscious mind we're aware of and have direct control over) and some sub-conscious parts are actually superior over the conscious (in other words superior over ""us""). We, consciously, are not completely in power, but there is a higher subconscious mind if you like which dictates our thoughts and which we don't have control over, we are in essence a slave to this. Something the Matrix almost got spot on but got wrong in parts where it showed that you can consciously break out of this mental prison. Something which Inception also got wrong in how it talked about subconsciousness.And in fact when lucid dreaming you are NOT unconscious, you are in a state of consciousness whilst still asleep, aware that any crossover between your thoughts running wild and being able to think consciously doesn't strictly make sense. You are able to sleep in a state of semi-consciousness, conscious enough to be able to focus on any aspect of the dream to change it how you like. I did not find this film to be smart, it did not make me think (more than oh it made the same kind of mistake as the matrix philosophy which I'd already previously thought about), did not awe me with philosophy, but it just annoyed me with how juvenile the films take on unconsciousness is and how incorrect I think it is. It probably could have been so much more and explored ideas that could have stunned me, but it fell completely flat. Even in the DVD extras some professor of dreams? Or something, talks about this, and this person too annoyed me with what they said because I think they just don't get it, don't get what subconsciousness and consciousness really is.That is my take on it, I might sound crazy but, I disagree strongly with any of the fundamental ideas behind the films interpretation of what unconsciousness actually is, every time ""unconsciousness"" or the ""subconscious mind"" was mentioned it annoyed me because I disagreed with what was being said, I did not at all find it a clever film with clever concepts and fresh philosophical ideas."
119267,False,"This is not Sci-Fi Movie It's REAL and the director of that movie know this very well. Its Dream Walking State. And what is funny that This happened to me before 5 years. The Dreams are not just Dreams. this is My DRAM Short:I dream very interesting dream before around 5 years So what i dream exactly is I was in one place with my Uncle and my Father. And we speak different things, also after a while i quarrel With my Father and after this i just Wake up.So when i wake up drink some coffee and after few minutes i was going on my Uncle Home to see what they do etc.. like normal. When i come at his Home.. he look at me and told me.. ""What you dream Ysterday"" and looking me strange, for few seconds i just was totally shocked and i was sure that he know about my dream. After this he explained me without to know anything before, he told me what i TOLD to him and what i told to my Father every single word.. and also he remember the position of everyone.. like you was here i was there you told me this, he told me that and etc..So its very wired that he was on the same time, on the same place in the Dream and also know what exactly i told to him and remember it.. i remember the whole dream also..was like real i can feel the air the bird everything. And that not all after around 4-5 days later I saw my Father and YES he had absolutely the same DREAM and yes he remember too every word what i told to him what he told me and the position of eveybody...How is possible 3 Peoples to dream exactly the same Dream on the same time and also to have conversation of this dream and everybody to remember the conversation and etc!?Thats it.Is well know as Dream Walker and the therm mean that for example YOU can conect with everybody you want no matter how far is he/she and to do whatever you want with them u can talk with them you can take them with you and create a different world.After the dream one day i watch ""Inception"" and i was shoked because everything inside the movie was like my dream i mean they just show in the movie that they are Dream Walkers and i was sure that the producent of that movie know very well for what about is this movie is not just a Sci Fi movie its a real deal but the people will not understand it only the few who know and have this experience already. And all the people say well super stupid movie we don't understand anything at all how to explain them that this is REAL and the movie is not a Sci Fi and the same happened to me in the real life."
119268,False,"I see all the glowing 10 star reviews and I am genuinely dumbfounded. It's just a second rate re-make of the Matrix. If you have 2 and 1/2 hours to spare, and are easily pleased you may find this mildly diverting. But to bill it as some kind of seismic event in the cultural history of western civilisation is just rubbish.The plot holes are bigger than the effects, the characters are entirely one dimensional and the dialogue is wooden. The final 30 minutes were spent staring at my watch, willing it to end, so I could go and do something more meaningful with my life, like watching some paint dry.I almost wonder if Christopher Nolan is playing games with us, trying to see how far he can push it before a small child steps forward and points out that the emperor is in fact completely naked."
119269,False,"Dear Christopher Nolan.Like Lenny feels compelled to search for the murderer of his wife in Memento considering even when he realizes the truth, as compelled have I been to write to you about a personal catharsis I've had and still am going through that you indirectly have contributed to help me define and following changing myself after immersivly enjoying Inception on a level I never thought possible. The playful ending with the top in Inception and the following endless discussions is simply reminded me of The Prestige; ""They want to be fooled"" and the mass audience are showing some weird and funny theories of reality and dreams regarding Inception. Incredible how a movie can mess with someones mind. Shame is that people don't discuss the brilliance of the movie as much as its ending. But perhaps thats what you aimed for, I have a radical notion. In some years to come perhaps the mass audience will look past the top and truly recognize the simple, yet powerful truth. Life now feels like a dream, I gotta be asleep to believe it. These past 9 months..so much have transpired. And I've been on and off about sending this letter. I could write a novel about what more has happened, and I think I will end up doing that someday. Its just hard as hell to remember where to begin. Im most happy my sister returned after living abroad for 10 years. And she and my mom have been my Ariadne's in the wake of this awakening. My sister reminded me of SO much from my childhood, helping me put a lot of the puzzles back and see the real truth.The Batman trilogy has ultimately led to me understand that my brother has truly been a father to me more than my father ever was. He has been my superhero through my youth. I just did not understand the value in that he was carrying a mask to protect and shield his dearest ones. And am forever grateful for him, and I cannot delve into his soul like Bane did, because taking his mask off will most likely be catastrophic for everyone around him. I believe firmly he will endure it, and be the same protector and father for his son. Thank you Christopher. Im looking forward to a new beginning to this old soul. You are for me, the Tesla of filmmaking.-Kjetil."
119270,False,"I found this film to be neither the greatest (sci-fi or not) film ever, nor did it suck the way some recent commentators seem to think. I did think it was quite good. Leonardo DiCaprio has finally grown up and is an outstanding actor. Ellen Page was very good as well. (I had never heard of her until she was recently in some TV commercials in the U.S., which told me that lots of other people know who she is) For a pretty young actress, her role was 99% asexual. In only one very brief scene would it have mattered if the role was played by a man.But the best thing about Inception was its originality. It was not a sequel, remake, re-made TV show, or re-made comic book, which is all that Hollywood seems to churn out these days.As for its complexity, I was able to follow quite well, certainly well enough to enjoy it. The few points I'd missed, I read in the FAQ section here, and frankly, I'm not sure I would have gotten them on a second viewing alone.I understand why many folks are miffed by its high all-time ranking. Y'all just have to understand that so many voters are young people who have not seen, or do not like, classic cinema, so recent films will always be overstated. It will be interesting to see what Inception's rating will be twenty years from now.I recommend checking it out."
119271,False,"Wow, what a ride. Just saw it for the first time, and even though it felt overly convoluted, the visual effects are pretty interesting as well as the story. It definitely should be on some of the bigger lists of the year for its look into the subject of lucid dreaming and for its original filmmaking. It's a bit hard to wrap your mind around what depths the movie goes for after only one viewing, but I cheated and read the plot on Wikipedia beforehand to know what cues to look for as well as to study where the team in the movie are going next.The believability of a man so consumed with his look into lucid dreaming and its involvement with his family life and legal status in the United States sounds simple enough on paper, but Nolan really reached ridiculously far out there to make the story twist around on itself, perhaps a little too much. As much as it's praised, I don't really remember the soundtrack at all, and why Nolan needed Hans Zimmer to pair with Johnny Marr I'll never understand. The ending was touching and it mirrored similar films such as What Dreams May Come, which I thought was very weird and coincidental.Anyways, I enjoyed it. I found it very enjoyable even though most of the parts dragged when it came to DiCaprio's character dealing with his projections of his wife. I found it was convenient the way Elle Page's character would end up finding a way into every aspect of Cobb's life in the first week of meeting the guy, too. So some of this story is lacking logic, but it is sci-fi and should be followed only for as long as the film allows. Overall, 7/10 stars because even if I don't watch it over and over again, I can respect the time put into the story and the technical achievements they made with its filming."
119272,False,"Like many others have said about this film is that its a complicated plot but not that hard to follow or concentrate on. Leonardo Dicaprio (Another actor in Lee's top 10) is the star of the film in yet another visual masterpiece from my new favourite director Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight) In this he portrays Cobb a Dream specialist who with a team he personally assembled of other dream experts except jobs from high rollers to either invade someone's dreams and steal something per say a combination to a safe that they only know etc etc. Or his team can do Inception jobs, go in a person's dreams and place an idea in their minds for something that a person per say in the real world knows they are capable of and just need a little push in the right direction. Great stellar cast that is rounded off with Joseph Gordon Levitt, Ellen Page, Ken Wantanabe and the always great Cillian Murphy."
119273,False,"For all its flaws (and there are some), ""Inception"" succeeds as a star-studded blockbuster with a brain. Christopher Nolan has, yet again, crafted a work that manages to inspire both thought and awe: a rare feat, to be sure. As the film opens, the audience is thrown mercilessly into a scene of cascading schemes and chaotic confrontations. We, as audience members, feel uneasy; we don't know exactly where we stand on the characters or the situation at hand, and that's the way Nolan wants it (talk about 'in medias res'). By the time the first wave of tension subsides, another approaches in its wake. This new wave proves to be a tsunami; as the plot unfolds, revelations spring free, character motives come into question, and the film's dream world expands exponentially. The plot of ""Inception,"" without giving anything away, goes something like this. Leonardo DiCaprio's Cobb, a sort of ""dream thief,"" takes on one final assignment, courtesy of Ken Wantanabe's corporate kingpin. Cobb assembles a team, ranging from Joseph Gordon- Levitt's crafty pretty-boy to Ellen Page's boyish architect. Things get a little crazy as the mission proceeds (certain characters just might be holding back some important information), and a nail-biting spectacle takes the stage.I don't know how much Christopher Nolan was paid for this screenplay, but I can guarantee that it wasn't enough. The story examines the very nature of dreams; it explores their nuances, their limitations, and their possibilities, while at the same time exploring some of the science behind them. When characters have to choose between their dream worlds and reality, we have to consider which option we would embrace. When characters leap from layer to layer, we consider our own dream complexes. At the same time, a serpentine heist film unfolds on screen. While the plot does require the occasional suspension of disbelief, it plays by its own rules for the greater part of its running time.In fact, most of ""Inception's"" shortcomings have nothing to do with the plot. Apart from a few over-explained monologues at inappropriate times, the script succeeds ferociously. However, some problems arise with the characters and their actor counterparts. While Leonardo DiCaprio's performance doesn't hit the wrong notes, it doesn't always hit the right ones either. DiCaprio has a compelling voice and look, especially early in the film, but trouble brews when the emotional turmoil strikes his character. Rather than reach for new dramatic heights, he settles for simply adequate deliveries. As such, it becomes difficult to invest in his character as anything more than ""Man 1."" Some other talents in the cast, while solid, are given too little to do. Ellen Page is reduced to the classic ""angel on my shoulder"" stereotype, and Tom Berenger and Cillian Murphy are just asked to look concerned for most of the film's duration. Still, Joseph Gordon Levitt looks spiffy, Tom Hardy makes great comic relief, and no one does all too poorly. All in all, ""Inception"" makes for a great time at the theater. It sparks conversation, it moves briskly, and it looks brilliant on the big screen. If Hamlet were to see the dreams put on display here, he might just have shuffled off that mortal coil."
119274,False,"I went into Inception with considerable expectation, in regards to the talent and concept involved. I was expecting something truly groundbreaking: a blockbuster that didn't rely on Hollywood's conventions to wow audiences. Ultimately, all that Inception is, is a complex plot disguising a relatively shallow film, supplemented with your standard chase sequences and mindless gun battles where the heroes gun down scores of thugs, who in turn are conveniently inflicted with James Bond syndrome, where they can fire endless rounds and hit nothing. Nolan disguises this by having the one (and only) bullet connect early in the film.Let's talk about plot. I think Nolan has driven himself into a hole. He is universally lauded for his complex, original plots, which make people think, while simultaneously entertaining them. The only problem is, as his projects stack up, Nolan seeks to outdo himself in terms of plot and structure, and not in terms of emotional content. Inception is by far his most structurally complex plot, but unfortunately, the plot is so intricate that he spends the entire film explaining what is going on, rather than building any sort of emotional core for the audience. Watch people come out of a Pixar film, then watch people come out of a Nolan film. As people come out of Inception, they will be talking about the mind-bending plot and the cool fight scenes. You'll be hard pressed to find a conversation about the tragedy between Cobb and Mal. Compare Inception to The Fountain, which faced a similar dilemma. Unlike Nolan, Aronofsky sacrificed explaining his complex plot, and instead, focused on fleshing out emotional resonance in the characters and themes. Financially, it was a terrible decision, but Aronofsky's vision was much more respectable artistically. And don't get me started on Inception's ending 'twist,' which was an insulting cheap trick that will be probably be disregarded by most audiences.The music of Inception was also troublesome. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack was formidable, but did not fit with the atmosphere of the film. Instead of supplementing the film, the music made Inception seem pretentious. Just listening to it, you would have thought that the entire world was at stake. Instead, you were just facing a bunch of people that would have been dreaming for a long time, had they failed. Was being 'in limbo' really that big of a threat? I know that Nolan gave the reasons that their brains would rot and all, but I just didn't buy the danger. The film still had its merits. It's easily more intelligent than your average blockbuster, and will have you thinking to keep up with it (a friend compared it to playing a game of minesweeper). It has a great action scene or two, and some innovative visuals. But in the end, Inception doesn't have much to say, and unless you count sorting out plot as thinking, it won't leave you with substance to ponder."
119275,False,"Whenever someone asks me to recommend movies, my simple approach is to ask the movies that they enjoyed most in the past and based on that I recommend. On that ground  if you enjoyed Matrix, you are likely to enjoy Inception. (While the movies are very different ).In the day and age when approx 90 % of screenplays are adapted (on books, short stories, old movies), here is a concept that is gut wrenchingly original. This is where I have deepest admiration for Nolan as an artist and this is where he stands out from his contemporaries. This Original, Visionary, Fast Paced, Gripping, Complex, Multi Layered Cant-miss-a-second movie is pure genius. Apart from being almost perfect on all technical counts (Direction, screenplay.) it is highly entertaining cinema that is full of surrealism (which I am a big fan of). I hate writing something which is fan-boy gushing, but its really difficult here. I did not find any thing I did not like, I am sure if maybe I saw it a second time. Dom Cobb (Di Caprio) leads a highly skilled team, specializing in stealing secrets from people's minds by entering their dreams. When they are hired by a mysterious businessman, Cobb finally has a shot at redemption, but not before achieving the near impossible. Rather than stealing an idea, they must do the complete opposite: Inception. Planting the seed of an idea. The plot was very pleasingly intricate with a twist-and-turn, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel. I would be lying if I say that I understood 100 % of it, but then you don't expect that from Nolans, Scorseses, Lynchs or Kubrics and tell you what.. I am gearing up for the second viewing. Not once in life time  but is certainly, once in a 5 Years stuff.Do yourself a favor  Get the tickets, big tub of popcorn and ""Have A Ball"" !!"
119276,False,"Going into see Inception, I have to admit, my expectations were just about as high as they've ever been. I try not to anticipate films too much, so as to avoid disappointment, but with this one, I couldn't avoid it. My expectations were even higher than those I had for The Dark Knight. I just finished watching not thirty minutes ago, and here's how it breaks down. I was instantly drawn into the world that Nolan has so brilliantly created. Each time a new concept was introduced, I found myself captivated by it. I've heard people recently compare this film to Avatar. I have never heard such and erroneous comparison. The thing that separates that two is that Avatar is based solely on its visual effects. Things like that don't amaze me. I am well aware of the capabilities of today's technology. What did amaze me about Inception was not the visuals, it was the ideas. As the movie suggests, and idea is the most powerful thing on earth. It is the greatest weapon mankind possesses. Ideas have built and destroyed the greatest of nation thousands of times over. The ideas in Inception are truly amazing. A group of the 100 smartest people on earth could lock themselves in a room for a year, together, and they still may not imagine so many wonderful things. The first thirty minutes had only a few minor flaws. The next hour was totally spectacular. The final hour dragged somewhat. Everything that was happening was interesting, but it still dragged quite a lot. The beauty of the film, though, is that even when it drags, the ideas behind it never cease to amaze from start to finish. I believe a second viewing may be in order, just to nail down exactly what I didn't like. However, what I did love about it is and will always be very clear. This is the most creative, imaginative, deeply though out film I have ever witnessed. The ideas deserve more than a 10. It is a shame that a lack of knowledge of how to really use them plagued the last hour. But, for all its flaws, its concepts are still truly mind blowing."
