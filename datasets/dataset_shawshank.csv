"I can't begin to describe every amazing element of this film. Obviously the performances are exquisite, the directing is exceptional and the score is extraordinary.",0
"'The Shawshank Redemption' is perhaps one of, if not the, perfect film. Every other ""great film"", or any film for that matter has it's pros and cons. Most motion pictures that are as well received as this have plenty going for it, very few against it",0
" There are many twists and turns and I defy anyone to watch the ending without tears running down their face. In fact, the entire last third of movie is filled with marvelous scenes.",0
This was a very good movie. Robbins and Freeman are Terrific. It was a very moving movie. I would strongly recommend this movie.,0
Morgan freeman's background voice will keep you with the story.Dialogues were well executed.The strongest part was it's narration which makes it the best,0
 The pacing was a little slow at times and the running time of 142 minutes made the film feel a bit long but the rest made up for it's few flaws. Overall despite it's flaws The Shawshank Redemption is definitely a must see a movie that can't be missed.,0
" If your looking for a deeper movie more than you're typical action flick, this will provide what you were looking for. Go out and rent it, heck go and buy it because you'll want to watch it time and time again.",0
I am so glad I watched it! I was sort-of suicidal when I watched it,0
This is exactly the type of movie the new era cinema need ... Magic!,0
"All these wonderful factors carried the film along to its shocking but wonderful conclusion. I won't spoil if you haven't seen it but I will say that the film truly ends, perfectly!",0
"These artists show their capability to produce art, real art that in spires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.So, Shawshank is the must see movie in your life before you gone.",0
" The whole story tells about the moral to heed i.e. ""Hopes Never Die.""",0
"The development of these human issues is completed by a classic story of survival in prison , seen in previous films and of course many post "" The Shawshank Redemption "" with a spectacular climax in the form of happy ending",0
The simplicity of the message within the complication of human interaction and misunderstanding. It was a shocker.,0
"The movie is a beautiful story about hope that holds you above the surface even when your life seems meaningless. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robins are magnificent, and this film I can recommend to anyone.",0
Story unfolded in an unexpected way. And that was really satisfying.,0
"The Shawshank Redemption is such a powerful example of how people can overcome any hardship, and it gives fantastic insight on the value of time and how its never too late to live.",0
I like the script and the way it handles the plot..,0
"I really could not find anything worth my time in this film, and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the end, one or two good lines of dialog and the acting,",0
"Movie starts with a murder and everything goes normally, the dialogues and the feel of this movie are too diplomatic and at the end its like a parabola,everything reverses .",0
" Robbins and Freeman are outstanding, layering their performances with snippets of individuality",0
" The finale is pure fantasy, however it does provide the audience with the release it needs, and Robbins and Freeman are excellent. ",0
" The serene and true wallpapers, without exaggeration or unnecessary dramas, stand out mainly by Tim Robbins and Morgam Freeman.",0
" a prison inmate has spent so much time in prison, he has forgotten how to live outside the prison walls. Integrity and perseverance are major themes.",0
" I had been told what a great film it was by all and sundry, but I found it utterly average. I am afraid I just didn't get what was so fantastic about the movie.",0
The most overrated movie ever. A classic? Yes. A masterpiece? Maybe. Best movie ever? Hell no.,0
"It's an ""emotional manipulation for dummies"" type of film, with boring direction and cardboard characters.",0
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a very safe film. Not so much in terms of story, but in how it's executed.",0
"Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a masterpiece? No.",0
it is a slightly overdone and there is a bit too much 'triumph of the human spirit' dribble on the side. ,0
The power and depth in this movie was it's ability to make prison life and friendships look better than that on the outside. Also when they were finally released they were so hesitant to live on the outside and wanted to go back in,1
 You will really would not believe that a certain person could make a hole so long that you can make a way out. I can't still imagine how the main character made it.,1
" It was touching, no doubt about it, but then the message of hope is dwarfed by our excitement that the two friends are together again.",1
 The sad tale of Brookes who had spent his life in prison and dies in freedom is the emotional heart of the film,1
 the only moment that for me is extraordinary is only the escape scene.,1
The plot with Dufresne taking on his alter-ego on escape was clever and the suicide of Brooks was a bit moving but this was not enough for me,1
" Andy's escape bothered me. It was too ""easy"" ",1
 Andy hides the hammer in his prison issue bible in the book of Exodus. As with most of Frank Darabont's adaptations of King's works this change is subtly brilliant.,1
"When Andy doesn't answer for roll call, and following some intense foreshadowing, the audience is led to believe that Andy's escaped by killing himself, especially when the guard stares into the cell and says, shocked, ""Oh my holy god.""",1
 Andy talks the guys who are beating him up out of raping him using his knowledge of medical trivia,1
" Norton sets up Tommy's murder to look not like an accident, but like a justified shooting during an escape attempt.",1
"At first, Andy's assistance with money laundering may seem like a case of this, but it turns out that he had a plan all along for getting said money launderer busted in the long run.",1
Brooks hangs himself because he can't cope with freedom after 50 years in prison.,1
"Andy steals one of the warden's suits prior to his escape, and wears it the next day when he withdraws money from the bank. Andy is noticeably taller than the warden, yet the suit fits him like it was tailored for him.",1
" Hadley beats a man to death for crying, beats Bogs until he's paralyzed for life and shoots Tommy and frames it as a failed escape attempt for agreeing to testify to Andy's innocence.",1
"The second time around, you cringe at exactly how close the Warden came to walking off with Andy's hammer, or discovering the hole behind his poster. ",1
"Word gets out about Norton's corruption. Then, instead of going into another rant or anything like that, he just shoots himself before the police can get into his office door.",1
"He also hides the tunnel in his cell's wall behind the poster of Rita Hayworth, and later Raquel Welch  a literal cover up",1
"When Warden Norton refuses to investigate the possibility that Elmo Blatch actually killed Andy's wife and her lover, Andy tells him that if he got out of prison he'd never mention what he was doing for the Warden.",1
" Elmo Blatch, the man who really murdered Andy's wife and her lover, is never spoken of again after Tommy's story.",1
" Blatch, the only criminal in the movie to gloat to others about killing people. In his conversation with Tommy, Blatch mentions the very murders that get pinned on Andy. You'd think this would be the kind of thing that would backfire, and yet because of the warden's desire to keep his own crimes secret, Blatch gets away with this in spite of said gloating. ",1
The way he looks at the tunnel he discovers by accident when throwing a rock at a poster absolutely amazing.,1
"Andy sold off his assets before going into prison and invested them with the help of a friend on the outside. This subplot is eliminated in the movie, in which Andy simply steals all the money he'd laundered for Norton, making the revenge that much sweeter ",1
"When Andy breaks the pipe, sewage fountains out, going upwards to make a great image for the cinematographer. However because the end of the pipe Andy crawls out of was not sealed the sewage wouldn't have been under any pressure at all.",1
"Warden Norton, unlike in the book, shoots himself in his office rather than let the police break in and arrest him. The bullet shatters the window behind him.",1
"Norton asking Tommy whether he'd be willing to testify that Andy is innocent. He doesn't let him do it- in fact, he has him shot.",1
 Andy played the warden for a chump!,1
 Andy keeps his rock hammer in his Bible.,1
" In the climax, Norton locks himself in his office as the regular cops try to bust the door down and arrest him, and, without Hadley to do his dirty work, takes different method of escape.",1
 I remember thinking it would take a man six hundred years to tunnel through the wall with it. Old Andy did it in less than twenty.,1
