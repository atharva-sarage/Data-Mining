Avengers Endgame is the best superhero movie ever. Tony Stark die is epic and dramatic scene. The final battle is wonderful!,1
This movie is worth every penny.Go see it . you'll feet 11 years of movies making sense .,0
"No movie will be like this one . The ultimate conclusion and most satisfying ending , full of real vehement emotions ..",0
"It was an amazing and sad experience at the same time , ofc when u said sad i mean tony stark",1
"This was movie was the perfect way to bring together everyone, let's us know how about many of the Avengers including how the years since the snap has affected them and it allows them the ability to resolve or revisit their past. Love seeing everyone united, loved seeing the A-Force. Laughing, surprises, tears. Just perfection.",1
A great Visual spectacle about everything you want with avenger End game.. RDJ again proves why he is best with.I am Iron Man Chris Evans nails with Hammer(Mjolner) and Sheild,1
"Avengers Endgame is best MCU Movie. Endgame contains epic scenes. Especially Avengers Assemble, I am Iron Man and Captain America lifts Mjolnir scenes is Amazing",1
In the scenes when Tony Stark and Captain America go back to 1970 stan lee's cameo he was driving a 72 cutlass should have been 1970.,1
"Robert Downey Jr. died. The ever gorgeous Scarlett Johansson died. I am quite sure marvel will find a way to undo their death as how the vanished halves of the superheroes were brought back to life in the movie. Avengers will no longer be that great without the abovesaid names playing respective superheroes - because Evans, Johansson, and downey Jr. are indispensable! ",1
The final battle for the infinity stones left me in tears. I thought it was beautiful that captain America was able to wield thor's hammer. And when all the heroes started to materialize out of nowhere I thought I would scream with excitement!,1
"If you haven't seen this movie, you need to get a box of tissues, and go watch it cuz it's soo good!!!",0
I can't describe how many emotions went through me during the movie. It was just amazing portrait of what an complex movie should look like :) It was an experience for whole life,0
The Best Marvel movie ever seen. Emotional and comedy and Goosebumps scene... Go watch in theatre,0
"All the emotion, action and humour packed into one!! if you love action movies, then this is for you. The start was slow when we saw how they went 5 years after the events of Infinity War, it was depressing but hey, Asgard is back, but then they bring time travel after Ant-Man comes back from the quantum realm but that was a nice start, but then all the action comes up from there, Tony and the rest on the ship is rescued which is amazing, but the final battle, oh boy, SO DAMN AMAZING!!! And that's not it, Captain America has Thor's hammer, holy crap, but now to the sad part. Black Widow is dead, Tony Stark is dead, which death made you cry the most. GOODBYE STAN!!!",1
"The movie wraps up everything perfectly, that was 11 years and 21 movies in the making. It's make you laugh, cry, and every other emotion you can think of. It's an end of a journey that wraps up perfectly.",0
"This masterpiece brings you joy, tears, excitement and so much more. You definitely have to see it. When I first saw it Wednesday night, I was so overwhelmed that I've decided to see it again this Thursday!!",0
"This entire movie was based on time travel, it's in the same category as Hot tub time machine. It's so awful its embarrassing.",1
Wow very cool. Time travel? Literally the laziest plot ever,1
"The final chapter of the Avengers started of unexpected, but the 2 hours after that were boring, only focusing on some really cheasy jokes and there was barely a story line. They messed up a few major characters big time and only later in the film I began to enjoy the movie. The ending was of course really sad and I had a certain sympathy for the characters.",0
"Hawkeye loses his family with the snap. Tony Stark and Nebula are stranded in space. They are rescued by Captain Marvel. What remains of the Avengers set off to confront Thanos only to find that he had already destroyed the Stones. Five years later, Scott Lang escapes from the quantum realm. He is shocked by the new world order and comes up with an idea to save everyone, a Time Heist.",1
"I've been looking forward to this for so long, and it surpassed all my expectations. It is a thrilling ride, an emotional journey, and has comedic moments as well. It even causes tears to fall. I can't wait to watch it again.",0
"On one hand, this was to be much respected for the approach it took, and yet on another, all of the time-traveling becomes kind of messy and convvoluted.",1
This is a good movie. But it could have been better. It has great acting. It also has a good story line. It is not a great story line mind you. The Avengers age of Ultron is mush better.,0
"After the events from Infinity War, for those who survived life has not been easy, but make the best of what they can, until Ant Man comes in the picture, has the equipment to time travel, so they all make a plan to go back in time and get the stones before Thanos does, but the question is will they succeed?",1
"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans & more star in this 2019 action sequel based on the Marvel Comics. In this final installment of ""The Avengers"" series, Tony Stark/Iron Man (Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Evans) and more try to give humanity a second chance after the unfortunate events of the last film, but must find the 6 infinity stones that are the key and face the evil, Thanos (Josh Brolin) again. My only gripe with this film is that it's too long, but other than that I thought it was good.As usual and there's neat effects. There's also humorous, emotional and action-packed moments. I recommend this, especially if you're into comic books/superheroes.",1
"The almost 3 hours flew by with great writing and effects, and the change of the characters lives made it that much more entertaining - especially Thor! Better than I expected, and a wee bit better than the last film imo. 9/10",0
"This film is the masterpiece of the genre. What a cast too. I think after some settling I will actually feel inspired to go through the entire franchise again knowing this carrot is at the end. No criticism of any kind can I think of. Truly excellent to the point even if you're never seen anything Marvel you should step up and see Avenger's"" Endgame.",0
That's what I call ideal ending. It was really interesting to watch this film from first to the last minute. Film is over 3 hour long however it wasn't too long for me. Yeah Iron Man died. Which was brave from his still I'm not a fan of Iron Man so it was Okay from me. Plot was almost a masterpiece just one detail was really hideous. Why Avengers waited for 5 years to kill Thanos it's just a little bit nonsense. However movie was amazing 9/10. Worth all the awards.,1
By the time Avengers: Endgame (2019) still fresh in my mind I can say that this movie is one of the best well spend 3 hours in my life and the best conclusion to the first chapter in the MCU history. I can't wait to see how they outdo all of this in the next 10 years,0
"What have they done wrong with this movie ""everything"" They have turned Thor & Hulk into joke characters the whole movie feels hurried and confusing the CGI is poor on more than one occasion a lot of MCU characters are more cameos than necessary.I enjoyed the early Marvel movies but the most recent ones are ruining the franchise how they made so much £££ out of this is baffling it only gets more confusing the longer you watch it.I am not sure why so many cameos were necessary as Captain Marvel was all that was needed",1
Firstly I'm a big film buff. I watch on average one film per day crossing genres and countries. I watched the first two hours then turned this movie off and went to bed. Seriously two hours to cover what should only take about 40 to 50 mins. Normally films have twenty minutes to set the story and introduce the characters. This film spends one hour reintroducing characters from the other movies then the characters decide what to do. Then another hour of idle chit chat. This movie is full of itself. I'm so glad I didn't bother going to the cinema to watch this. I'm sure there was going to be some action at some point but I ran out of patience.,1
"Some parts were done well, revisiting the previous films was a treat but the film overall was pretty lousy. Cap and Tony's departure were not well executed. There are several reviews already on why Cap's exit was out of character and unlikely, look them up if you don't see it. Tony, always wrong, sacrifices himself finally after a lifetime of selfishness, which is a heroic exit in a way, but was a pretty lame ending for such an important character. The movie relies HEAVILY on trying to pull viewer's heartstrings vice have decent writing and make sense in many ways. The SJW nonsense has been out of control in these movies as well for sometime now, more prevalent in the agents of shield series though tbh. Time for Disney to let it go.",1
There's There will be blood and more recently Leave No Trace. And then there's this crap. Acting that makes my eyes hurt and a story so bad I just want to stop watching (which I did). It's movies like this that makes me lose faith in the art of film making. And the rating 8.7 just makes me wanna stop talking to people. What a waste of money...,1
"I am a huge Marvel fan and have loved the previous Avengers films so went with high Hope's for this, unfortunately I was disappointed beyond belief. Long, slow, dull scences make up most of the movie with only about 10 minutes of actual action. Main characters are sidetracked for less popular ones and the whole film moves at a snail's pace. It really felt like they had run out of ideas and this is just a money making film. So, so let down and would not recommend.. recommend it to anyone",0
watch all films with an open mind and went into this 3 hour long film without any preconceptions.,0
"This film really let itself down. The writers completely changed some of the characters, they tried to make it funny and failed at every attempt where it was cringe worthy and boring. The story was dragged out to its limit and went on for way to long.",0
"Don't waste your money at the cinema, maybe Google the outcome.",0
"Time travel destroys any film...time travel doesnt exist in the physical world..its an invention of writers and authors to close plot holes and impress audiances...so, any film or book containing time travel, IS A MESS! so, i dont see any reason to grade this movie more than 2 stars...cgi, fights, ok , but a real good movie, must have a believable story! for me, sorry it didnt work... question...why thor and hulk had to be humiliated so much in this movie ? why toni stark had to die? to offer the framatic essence to the story?",1
In the story Iron man saves the day. They take away Iron man that's like my favorite superhero. The whole going back in time thing something was missing out of the movie. The movie was funny with Thor and hulk. Hulk trying to normalize his power. It just seemed like great fight scenes all for a pointless gauntlet. Just seemed like a lot of pointless fighting. They were trying to get everyone back in the process losing two characters. Didn't like the scene with Hawkeye and black Widow. They both eagerly wanting to jump off the cliff. When all they had to do was stop Thanos from getting it in the first place. The last two movies have been really hard to follow.,1
So i just watched it for the second time yesterday and i have to be honest this movie is boring as hell until the final fight and now that I watched it for the second time the final fight was ok this movie is so overated in my eyes firat time i watched it i was nearly falling asleep in theater because nothing intersting was happenning people going to hate me for this but I dont care I had more fun watching Dark Phonenix then this boring ass movie mcu movies are so overated in my opinion!,0
"So impossibly random that a malfunction would happen to let Thanos see the pasts future which is impossible even for superhero movie standards.Plus if you had the all powerful hand you could have controlled the event and caused your not death. Just saying.And why was it so easy to chop hand and head in one scene but then, So difficult to handle Thanos with more super power hero's at the ready??Thor fat??? Just dumb, ruined the movie for me.Part one was just so good and flowed so well.",1
"They wasted so much time on going back in time with the infinity stooges and going into boring time lines and not enough time filling in blanks and expanding more on the characters we loved the same way they did in IW. It's sad this is how all these years of movies was wrapped up. What a disgrace. I actually left the theatre angry. I don't agree with how they left things with Thor,",1
"The whole time travel is just a complete mess and how easy were the avengers able to get all the stones, that was a joke. In regards to the battle at the end it was ok but it's almost like the writers wanted it to be this big iconic battle that people would be talking about for years but that fell flat too. This films been 10 years in the waiting and 21 films later and to end like that was just poor...So poor.",1
"Other reviews have added what a hot mess this is. I have a theory that resorting to use time-travel as a fix-all is nothing more than a lazy way out. It proved so here for sure. The holes in the time-travel portion of the plot are big enough to drive a Mack Truck thru.And it gets worse the more you ponder it. Hulk as wimp? Thor as a fat couch potato? And Captain Marvel... She's hinted to be the savior all during the credits of Infinity War then makes little more than a cameo appearance in End Game.The movie did succeed as a way to get Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey Jr. out of the MCU going forward. Bravo, we didn't need 3 hours for that.",1
"The storyline being absolutely terrible is almost unrepairable. However, they do try and fail. The bjg problem is it's finally clear the choppiness and flow are off due secrecy and too much outsourcing. In order to obacure the plot, different companies are awarded different CGI scenes without ever being told the whole enchilada so that they can't leak anything... Of course this method requires there to be a very strong movie plot to begin with or you end up with chop suey. This movie has a few moments of good laughs and one liners... And that's it. It's a total and complete failure.",0
"The plot was messy, and so vast, with so many amazing characters, who were all simply diluted into one giant mess of a movie. Didn't really find the humour amazing either.",0
"As Soon as ant man enters the movie with his time travel idea , the movie goes downhill to a point of no return.",1
Why did Captain Marvel didn't do that instead of Iron Man? She is pure energy... Why did Dr. Strange didn't opened a huge portal for Thanos and took them elsewhere? Or more simply why no one let Strange the time-stone and he just make a milion years go by on Thanos army. What happened to Thanos' ideology of saving the universe? Suddenly he just wants to destroy it?,1
This movie kinda sucked. Even worse than most other Marvel movies. It was just a mess. They shouldn't have even tried to explain their time traveling/dimension jumping. Quantum physics? Really? Ok. This movie overall is a comedy. There are a few pretty funny jokes. But most movies are much better than this movie.,1
The movie completely destroys some of the best built up characters of the series like Thor / Hulk. Even Thanos who was given a brilliant overlay of character traits was discarded with (literally) within the first 15mins of the movie and his return had no character depth at all.,1
The movie also proves Time Travel should never be used as a story botch job. The plotholes are ridiculous including how on earth Thanos is going to make it to the phase of Infinity War given he went to the future and was defeated in the one. That aside how on earth 5 years later all of Peter Parkers classmates are still in high school / the rest of the world literally has not moved on.,1
"Frank Capra had a golden rule - a movie can be many things but the number one sin is boring. Endgame - wanted to like it, spent money to like it, and .... boring. long, talkative and not worth the time. 2 hours would be fine, stretched to 3. Comedy was good mostly but not the padding. Long long intro shots of this and that. It finally hit the gold standard of DC. It took itself way way too seriously. So I am disappointed and sad. About right up there with Star Trek - The Motion Picture for boring. I don't like writing this, but ....... boring.",0
"I don't know where to start!! Plot holes all the way through, Two of the strongest Avengers might as well have not bothered! Thor and Hulk are rubbish in this movie. Danvers? Forget it. Saved tony smashed a ship, but Thanos can still throw her about?? So we travelled through the quantum realm, but had the time stone early..... why not use that? The Mjolnir and Caps Shield change of ownership just annoyed me. But my biggest Disappointment was how they didn't use Thor or Hulk. Hulk has been sold out massively in the MCU and it sucks. I could go on all day. The more I think about it, the less I like it. That's me done with Marvel now. RIP Stan Lee.",1
This movie is a desaster. I had high hopes that they can recreate the awesomeness of Infinity War but they couldn't deliver. Time travel ruines the logic of every movie. That of a movie universe of 10 years even more so. But why didn't they let Captain Marvel do all the work. She can everything and is powerful and can speak and breathe in space and destroys spaceships with ease and is all around invincible and badass and female. What a joke...,1
"First half plain boring, dialogues rubbish. Then it gets worse. A caricature of Thor, blurred action scenes, nonsensical time travel plot, weird Hulk, battle field done much better in Lord of the Rings and all of a sudden the whole Marvel universe appearing, where were there just 5 minutes before? And Thanos??? A sad follow up to an incredible infinity war.",1
"This movie was awful; the acting was abhorrent, the special effects looked like a spy kids movie, and the plot was verging on completely ludicrous. I was ready for a simple popcorn flick, but this movie committed the worst crime of all; it was horrendously boring.
",0
"This movie is pure awesomeness. This is a movie, i will be remembered for eternity. Just a big thanks. Cinema was never so much entertaining. Can't wait for blu ray disk",0
Not a patch on infinity war - in fact I would of preferred finishing the franchise with infinity wars ending! Ragnorak had natural humour - they tried forcing humour into this and it went down like a lead balloon!,0
After the years of a big buildup what a big let down . There was plot hole after plot hole and little action scenes. Thanos was like a little girl in comparison to infinity war . Captain Marvel one of the most powerful in the galaxy was on annual leave only there for little bits . The Hulk was a disappointment. Thoese rating a high score are just not watching the movie at all .,1
Just bad a lot of things don't ad up cap America swinging Thors hamer like he's the God of thunder they sell out on Thors character just to be funny what actually was a bit the only funny part in the movie the hulk okay he changed good for him and a couple other things like this I feel like they just put a boring 180 min movie togetter cause they will sell tickets anyway it's a whole build up for a climax in the movie that only last 15 min and it has realy no surprises they use more parts of old movies then they actually made a movie and yes time travel.................. Just like hey lets go back do it differently and let's win??? I'm a big movie enthusiast but I won't go to the theaters for a marvel movie again.,1
"Average. 1st 2hr you will die. If are till the end, last 45 will satisfy you. It's Captain and Thor show and in the end we missed the Iron Man. Rip",1
3 hours of crap. One guy says time is not linear and damn! Quantum physics solved.,1
"i was so anxious to see it that in the past two weeks i kept dreaming and thinking about it every day. But, unfortunetly, the movie dissapointed me pretty much. I really like the Ruso brothers and they have had great imagination and are good at what they do, but this movie was casted and filmed in a hurry with little to almost no action at all and lack of inspiration and imagination. They could have done a much better job with the Endgame movie but i guess that is what happens when you rush to make even more money and don't care much about the fans. Hope they make it up to us with their next movie.",0
"When half of the universe has been wiped out, when your dear ones passed away and when all hopes have been faded, don't worry, just ask a big green guy to help you travelling the time and all your problems will be solved. That basically sums up the film. All's well that ends well except for a philanthropic billionaire in a metallic suit who gives his life to save the universe...how original! All the fake emotions and childish humors from the post 2000's superhero movies are masterfully treasured here as well for the delight of the simple minded. Adding all the enjoyable special effects and the diversity of the superheroes eclipsing the incoherent simplistic plot, and that gives you the most profitable movie of all time. Better on the form nothing on the substance if you ask me. But well, to each his own!",1
To long could have cout out 1 hour and it wouldn't have mad a diffrence. They ruined Thor and Hulk. Nobody died except for Cpt. A and Tony. Captain Marvel was just stupid. Thanos should have atleast killed somebody like ironmans wife or Tom holland the inferior spider man. Only good parts are when thanos punches Captain marvel and Captain America picking up Mjölnir.,1
"More than 2 hours of drama and only minutes of action...or at least that's what it felt like. Also, tons of that annoying Hollywood epic type of music to make me consider muting it.",0
"Except last 30 minutes, the whole movie is so lame. Bad writing. One of the worst movies Marvel ever made.",0
The worst of all the avengers sequence. Boring apart from some cool action scenes. Stupid scene when CA lifts thor's hammer wtf. Also we were expecting Dr Strange to show his real powers and see him more in the movie as he is the most powerful,1
"Captain America, Iron man and the Avengers all should have stopped after their first movie. Antman was terrible whatsoever and only Thor Ragnarok was a better movie than the first in the serie. Endgame is a horrible movie and only rated high since it is the end of a well appreciated line.",0
"This movie sets up the rules of time travel - the no paradox approach, where whatever you do in the past have already been done at lead to this point - but forgets it midway: Thanos jumps ahead of events that have not happened yet. Go and watch Dark instead. That's actually interesting and plays in a different league of science, storytelling, everything.",1
"I think it was one of the worst superhero movies. In this film, they destroyed all the preparations made in the previous episode. It was very good to use the idea of time travel and it could be much better. The story of getting the stones was written without much thought. All stones were very comfortable. Changes that were ignored in time. Captain Marvel's role was very empty. The character's presence in the film was really wrong.",1
Wow horrible weak Story..i feel like am watching epic movie and Meet the Spartans.......😒😒 don't waste your time watching this!,0
Don't believe the reviews. I suspect it's people paid to do positive reviews. Either that or I saw a different movie! Nothing much happens for 2 hours. There was no plot to speak of and i could have written better dialogue! The soundtrack is the best thing about it serious,0
What a horrible way to end. A waste of 11 years. So sad.,0
"The length of the movie increased with long talks, which makes almost no contribution to the plot or highlight heroes characters. Instead of Marvel usual excitement feeling (although I am not big fan of comics) you get the feeling was it worth to spend 3h. If the movie would be brutally cut to 1.5 it would be good end product by Marvel.",0
Expected more much more as a fan I have continue sly fallowed the franchise wanted a better way of story telling much better story line it felt like every world from different song in a same album glued together in the worst way possible,0
"2hours, no joke.. on a story that struggled to be interesting and felt disattached to the universe most of the time. Then the action begins and you're like finally something is happening! But if you're looking for a well orchestrated and good battles versing Thanos' generals like infinity war well there's none of that they all die as soon as they appear basically. Just like the cameos of the avengers who disappeared, almost as pointless but only over shadowed by Captain Marvel and her 2min total feature time.",1
"If I had a time stone I'd get those 188 minutes back. If I had a space stone I'd patch over the countless plot holes that I witnessed. Not even a reality stone could create a world where Tony Stark perfectly executes time travel with no prior knowledge of it, and for standard rules of time travel to be ignored afterwards. If I had a power stone I'd pummel the writers heads in for very little action, poor pace and zero explanation of how Captain America single handedly returned all the stones to the exact time and place they were taken. If me or a friend could get the soul stone, I'd jump so I wouldn't have to watch that garbage again. If I had the mind stone, I'd make sure nobody else chose to experience it either.",1
"The movie unsuccessful attempted to get sensual but it was way from it ,it felt like a roller coaster with the sequence of action, too many things happening in a short segment that will throw you off from enjoying the movie , it is too long and that tells you something , too many characters , lol you will get lost, like wow this a way odd. If you decide to watch it avoid the 3D version. Honestly , it was way below my expectations .",0
" did not like Endgame. Infinity War was so good.. I don't know why, but.. i did not leave the cinema with a good feeling after watching this film.. thanos brought so much pain and then he is just working in his garden? Weak and aimless? In my opinion, it wasn't funny what happens with Thor's belly.. and the rest of him.. He has always been this strong man and suddenly he is afraid of everything.. idk And of course, it made me really sad that Black Widow died instead of hawkey. In the end of the day, I am also sad bc of Iron Man, too.",1
"I was avenger fan, but what I saw was really juvenile and even a 10 years kid could write better than this one, I could accept the death of 2 main characters but the end was really unacceptable, my mind can't till now ingest it. I will give it 3 stars one for CGI, one for whole team efforts including productions team and actors and finally one for audience who wasted their 3 hours watching this trash...",1
"After Infinity Wars, this is what utter disappointment feels like. Lazy, shoddy writing, a story full of plot holes that are inevitable with time travel, incomprehensibly misguided story lines (Thor, Hulk, the hammer, easily created new gauntlets, Thanos, Black Widow's death an afterthought while Tony Stark gets a 20 minute funeral, a wasted Captain Marvel, a botched final battle), and boring, so boring. I noticed people around me checking the time on their phones or going to be the bathroom because nothing was happening.",1
"Watched this on first day of opening. I was holding really high hopes, based on Infinity war, and i was really dissapointed. This movie has some good parts, and im ok with the final result, but the journey there was bad and really messed up. In general the whole movie felt like the main story is a couple of actors (and here i really mean actors, not theirs fictional characters) saying goodbye to marvel and mcu. Infinity war, Thanos, infinity stones, fate of universe, etc, seems just like a minor side story. Very, very sad waste of 3 hours.",0
"Having come out of Infinity Wars blown away, to then be greeted with this as the follow up was a complete and utter let down! The plot holes that are opened up when time travel is introduced just ruins the full experience. The fact that at the end they could just pull the stones from the glove is ridiculous, did they not think about doing that when Mantis has Thanos under her control in Infinity wars?? This story could have been taken a whole different direction, with a lot more action to obtain the stones back from Thanos! Thor was made to be weak, Captain Marvel was barely there and the HULK was just all wrong! The comedy was about the only saving grace for me.",1
"Such a disappointment. They over hyped it. Too many plot holes that gave us more questions in the end. Russo brothers dropped the ball big in this one. No elaboration on the ancient one, doctor strange, hulk doesn't fight anyone, Loki disappears, and you never hear anything about vision. This movie made me cringe. If you follow the comics and a true fan of the movies then you will be lost. If you don't follow it like that then you are going to be as lost as you have ever been in any movie. This seems like the fall of the MCU.",1
"Main problem with this movie is too much humor it forces you to get through the whole time... Action builds up, heats up, ....killed by an absolutely stupid 'supposed to be funny' joke...this and time travel idea was so lame.. cudnt they think of more out of the box ideas? Of course if you go back in time u will win .. so lame.. and movie runs way too long to give u the nice main actions scene the last hour.. other avengers has more main action sequences than that... Not to mention that they totally destroyed the idea of the hulk once they made him wear freakin glasses and turn him into a smart ass funny character.. last movie doesnt have to be the best... Actually the 10/10 reviews make me wonder... Was I watching the same film? Can the fact that you are a fanboy makes u like sth ridiculous as this?",1
"Thanos...In Infinity War they've created the most complete villain in the superhero movie history just to destroy him in Endgame in an instant. Thanos was genuinely build as a complex character and turned into an average villain in this movie. 2. Thor. Why the hell did they mock the best, or one of the best character in the Marvel Univers? They transformed Thor in a drunk, fat, emotional cry baby character. 3. Logic. The movie has no logic regarding the time travel, the stones power, Thor's Mjolnir and so on.",1
"The death of Tony Stark was completely unnecessary. They rush the movie at the end. As a fan of Iron Man, this movie didn't made him justice.",1
"I wanted to see a MCU movie not a comedy movie with a lot of motivational speech. At one point it seemed they just wanted to make a competition of motivational speeches. The worst movie of the whole MCU saga. It really did ended my whole interest with superhero movies, such an endgame for me. Don't loose your precious time by watching this boring motivational comedy movie without any surprises.",0
"I just want to say a few things: Cap can suddenly hold and call Mjølnir, hammer of Thor??? Inconceivable! Hulk is suddenly nice, clever and funny?? Captain Marvel could swipe clean the whole shebang, but not Thanos? Cap suddenly decides to grow old and live an alternate timeline, without the rest? Is there NO respect for the back-catalogue and the comics anymore? And don't even get me started on the time-travel issue. So disappointed. No, no and no again, Marvel !!",1
"I saw the movie this tuesday ☺ (3 days before US ). Too long, no post credits scene, too cheesy at some points. And too many bad ideas... The movie is set 5 YEARS LATER then infinity wars...WTF... Thanos dies twice ?￰ﾟﾤﾣ?, Hulk is ridiculous Thor is ridiculous The remade of the Thanos /Gamora Vormir scene by Hawkeye /BlackWidow is ridiculous Cheesy sacrifice of Tony Stark with a ""Batman v Superman"" inspired funeral scene Anthony McKee the new Captain America ",1
"I really liked all of previous Marvel films, but this one was a huuuge disappointment. More than half of the film was really boring, in fact nothing happened. Fight scenes looked like made by 10-year-old Marvel fan. All of the film seemed to be made out of fan theories and dad jokes. I'm sad because it's the end of this Marvel era and this wasn't the final I was expecting.",0
"the scene to get the soul stone, it was obvious that black widow will be the one to die, because at the beginning of the movie, they try to give you a connection with Hawkeye by losing his family. Other example will be that their main characters like iron man will have a epic ending by dying or getting something they always wanted like capitan america.",1
"Horrible movie. Boring and poorly written. I don't understand the high rating or the hype. I didn't even finish watching it because it was so awful. I love all of the Marvel movies, but this one was unwatchable. What a waste of a perfectly good Saturday night.",0
"Horrible movie. Boring and poorly written. I don't understand the high rating or the hype. I didn't even finish watching it because it was so awful. I love all of the Marvel movies, but this one was unwatchable. What a waste of a perfectly good Saturday night.",1
Thor and Hulk were totally wasted.Average CGI and actions.Some dialogues felt forced and totally unnecessary.I expected more from marvel. The Infinity war ending was much better and epic.I will take endgame as an alternate ending,1
"Endgame is a total waste of good character development,acting and story. What they did to the Hulk and to Thor was truly unacceptable. The Hulk became some nerdy green giant that doesn't do stupid things and Thor became a very bad drunk guy not to mention that Captain America had the power to hold Thor's hammer al of a sudden? Like what? Killing of heroes is 1 thing, but killing of ironman is totally not needed. Of all those 500 avengers on that battlefield why him? Ironman was 1 of the characters that made this movie a bit interesting.",1
"didn't think this was politically correct enough. Captain Marvel is my favourite MCU character and It caused me great pain when the lovely Captain Marvel was brutally punched by the savage beast known as Thanos. I was overwhelmed with a great urge to help her like a heroic chivalrous knight but unfortunately as I sat there watching it on the screen in the cinema and knowing it wasn't exactly real, I knew I couldn't do anything about it and the second I realised that I burst into tears crying. If only I had the power to transport myself to fictional films I would've helped her out. I also thought the effects were terrible for a film with a $250 million plus budget and I felt Thor's alcoholism was inappropriate for a film that's watched by many children.",1
"It was a long time ago that i saw a movie this bad. It was a mix of Grease, Dirty Dancing and Star Wars combined. The endless tear-pulling scenes with heavy music and long faces. Storylines bouncing from left to right. At one point all wizards, superheros and comic heros came out of nowere to help fight the bad guy. It made no sense whatsoever. You have to be under 11 to appriacte this story. Sesame Street is a philosophical and deep story in comparison to this bad excuse for a movie.",1
