Avengers Endgame is the best superhero movie ever. Tony Stark die is epic and dramatic scene. The final battle is wonderful!,1
This movie is worth every penny.Go see it . you'll feet 11 years of movies making sense .,0
"No movie will be like this one . The ultimate conclusion and most satisfying ending , full of real vehement emotions ..",0
"It was an amazing and sad experience at the same time , ofc when u said sad i mean tony stark",1
"This was movie was the perfect way to bring together everyone, let's us know how about many of the Avengers including how the years since the snap has affected them and it allows them the ability to resolve or revisit their past. Love seeing everyone united, loved seeing the A-Force. Laughing, surprises, tears. Just perfection.",1
A great Visual spectacle about everything you want with avenger End game.. RDJ again proves why he is best with.I am Iron Man Chris Evans nails with Hammer(Mjolnor) and Sheild,1
"Avengers Endgame is best MCU Movie. Endgame contains epic scenes. Especially Avengers Assemble, I am Iron Man and Captain America lifts Mjolnir scenes is Amazing",1
In the scenes when Tony Stark and Captain America go back to 1970 stan lee's cameo he was driving a 72 cutlass should have been 1970.,1
"Robert Downey Jr. died. The ever gorgeous Scarlett Johansson died. I am quite sure marvel will find a way to undo their death as how the vanished halves of the superheroes were brought back to life in the movie. Avengers will no longer be that great without the abovesaid names playing respective superheroes - because Evans, Johansson, and downey Jr. are indispensable! ",1
The final battle for the infinity stones left me in tears. I thought it was beautiful that captain America was able to wield thor's hammer. And when all the heroes started to materialize out of nowhere I thought I would scream with excitement!,1
"If you haven't seen this movie, you need to get a box of tissues, and go watch it cuz it's soo good!!!",0
I can't describe how many emotions went through me during the movie. It was just amazing portrait of what an complex movie should look like :) It was an experience for whole life,0
The Best Marvel movie ever seen. Emotional and comedy and Goosebumps scene... Go watch in theatre,0
"All the emotion, action and humour packed into one!! if you love action movies, then this is for you. The start was slow when we saw how they went 5 years after the events of Infinity War, it was depressing but hey, Asgard is back, but then they bring time travel after Ant-Man comes back from the quantum realm but that was a nice start, but then all the action comes up from there, Tony and the rest on the ship is rescued which is amazing, but the final battle, oh boy, SO DAMN AMAZING!!! And that's not it, Captain America has Thor's hammer, holy crap, but now to the sad part. Black Widow is dead, Tony Stark is dead, which death made you cry the most. GOODBYE STAN!!!",1
"The movie wraps up everything perfectly, that was 11 years and 21 movies in the making. It's make you laugh, cry, and every other emotion you can think of. It's an end of a journey that wraps up perfectly.",0
"This masterpiece brings you joy, tears, excitement and so much more. You definitely have to see it. When I first saw it Wednesday night, I was so overwhelmed that I've decided to see it again this Thursday!!",0
"This entire movie was based on time travel, it's in the same category as Hot tub time machine. It's so awful its embarrassing.",1
Wow very cool. Time travel? Literally the laziest plot ever,1
"The final chapter of the Avengers started of unexpected, but the 2 hours after that were boring, only focusing on some really cheasy jokes and there was barely a story line. They messed up a few major characters big time and only later in the film I began to enjoy the movie. The ending was of course really sad and I had a certain sympathy for the characters.",0
"Hawkeye loses his family with the snap. Tony Stark and Nebula are stranded in space. They are rescued by Captain Marvel. What remains of the Avengers set off to confront Thanos only to find that he had already destroyed the Stones. Five years later, Scott Lang escapes from the quantum realm. He is shocked by the new world order and comes up with an idea to save everyone, a Time Heist.",1
"I've been looking forward to this for so long, and it surpassed all my expectations. It is a thrilling ride, an emotional journey, and has comedic moments as well. It even causes tears to fall. I can't wait to watch it again.",0
"On one hand, this was to be much respected for the approach it took, and yet on another, all of the time-traveling becomes kind of messy and convvoluted.",1
This is a good movie. But it could have been better. It has great acting. It also has a good story line. It is not a great story line mind you. The Avengers age of Ultron is mush better.,0
"After the events from Infinity War, for those who survived life has not been easy, but make the best of what they can, until Ant Man comes in the picture, has the equipment to time travel, so they all make a plan to go back in time and get the stones before Thanos does, but the question is will they succeed?",1
"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans & more star in this 2019 action sequel based on the Marvel Comics. In this final installment of ""The Avengers"" series, Tony Stark/Iron Man (Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Evans) and more try to give humanity a second chance after the unfortunate events of the last film, but must find the 6 infinity stones that are the key and face the evil, Thanos (Josh Brolin) again. My only gripe with this film is that it's too long, but other than that I thought it was good.As usual and there's neat effects. There's also humorous, emotional and action-packed moments. I recommend this, especially if you're into comic books/superheroes.",1
"The almost 3 hours flew by with great writing and effects, and the change of the characters lives made it that much more entertaining - especially Thor! Better than I expected, and a wee bit better than the last film imo. 9/10",0
"This film is the masterpiece of the genre. What a cast too. I think after some settling I will actually feel inspired to go through the entire franchise again knowing this carrot is at the end. No criticism of any kind can I think of. Truly excellent to the point even if you're never seen anything Marvel you should step up and see Avenger's"" Endgame.",0
That's what I call ideal ending. It was really interesting to watch this film from first to the last minute. Film is over 3 hour long however it wasn't too long for me. Yeah Iron Man died. Which was brave from his still I'm not a fan of Iron Man so it was Okay from me. Plot was almost a masterpiece just one detail was really hideous. Why Avengers waited for 5 years to kill Thanos it's just a little bit nonsense. However movie was amazing 9/10. Worth all the awards.,1
By the time Avengers: Endgame (2019) still fresh in my mind I can say that this movie is one of the best well spend 3 hours in my life and the best conclusion to the first chapter in the MCU history. I can't wait to see how they outdo all of this in the next 10 years,0
