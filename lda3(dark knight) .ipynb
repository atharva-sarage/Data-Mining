hands the convict the trigger and the convict promptly throws it out of the ferry, making it impossible for anyone on the convict ferry to blow up the 'innocent' ferry\", \"On the innocent ferry, after having voted to use their detonator, the officials can't bring themselves to act out the decision\", \"A man stands up, takes the detonator but is unable to press the button.\\n\\nThe Joker, on top of Batman while holding him down, shows signs of disappointment when neither of the ferries' passengers will stoop to his level\", \"As he's about to destroy the two boats, Batman fires his gauntlet darts at him, knocking the detonator out of his hands, and throws him over the edge of the building\", 'Before he can hit the ground, however, Batman fires one of his grappling gun tools at him and saves him', 'While hanging in front of Batman, the Joker tells him that the two of them are destined to fight forever, and how Batman really IS incorruptible', \"The Joker reveals to him, however, that his real plan was to engineer the fall of Gotham's White Knight, Harvey Dent, since that would introduce much more chaos when a good man like Dent is shown descending into chaos and evil\", 'Batman heads off to find Harvey, while the SWAT team captures the Joker.\\n\\nAt 250 52nd St, Gordon arrives to see Two-Face holding his family hostage', \"Two-Face knocks him to the ground and tells him that he's going to make him suffer just as he did, as he grabs his young son Jimmy and prepares to flip the coin for his fate\", \"Batman arrives and tells him to stop, and to blame the people responsible for Rachel's death\", 'So then Two-Face flips the coin for Batman, which lands on the dirty, scarred side, and Two-Face shoots him', 'He then flips the coin for himself and it lands on the clean side', \"As he's flipping the coin for Gordon's son, he tells Gordon to lie to the boy and tell him that everything will be alright, just as Dent himself had to tell Rachel earlier, seconds before she was killed\", 'Batman gets up and tackles him and they fall off of the building together', 'Unseen by them, the coin lands on the clean side', 'Batman hands Jimmy up to Gordon as Batman himself falls to the ground next to Two-Face, who lies motionless.\\n\\nAs Gordon climbs down to check on Batman, Batman laments that, in the end, the Joker won', 'By corrupting Harvey Dent and turning him evil, he tore down the best of them', \"If Gotham were to find out about Dent's murders, then the symbol of hope and faith he had given Gotham would diminish and all the prisoners he helped put back in jail would be let out, thus creating chaos\", \"Batman explains that Gotham can never find out about the murders, and takes the blame of them on himself, so that the Joker wouldn't win and the city's peace would remain.\\n\\nWe see a montage of Commissioner Gordon and other members of the Gotham City Police Department gathered at a memorial to Harvey Dent\", 'It is unclear whether he was killed or not', \"Gordon then smashes the Bat Signal above the MCU Building, while Alfred burns Rachel's note and Lucius shuts down the sonar machine with a pleased look\", 'Batman, in the background, continues to explain that by taking the blame of the killings, the faith that the people of Gotham had in Harvey Dent can be rewarded, and they can feel justified.\\n\\nBatman then runs from Gordon as the cops begin to chase him, and Gordon tells his son that while Harvey Dent was the hero Gotham needed, Batman is the hero that Gotham deserved', 'The bat-signal is destroyed and a manhunt is issued for Batman', 'Batman gets on his Batpod and speeds away, while Gordon declares:\\n\\n\"He\\'s a silent Guardian', 'A watchful protector', 'A Dark Knight.\"']\n",
