"This entire movie was based on time travel, it's in the same category as Hot tub time machine. It's so awful its embarrassing.",1
"This was a terrible film. I rented it and feel like I wasted my money. The movie is 3 hours long. 2 of those hours is just no Then you get abou thirty minutes of the big fight, followed by another thirty minutes of boredom. The male heroes are portrayed as buffoons, which is indicative of today's man-hating society. I thought the previous installment was bad. This installment lowered the bar even further. am glad I did not waste and money at the theater for this joke of a movie.",0
