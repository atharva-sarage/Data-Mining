24524,True,"After you see this movie, all other mobster movies you see or ever have seen will seem like garbage. They and their cast of characters will all appear cartoonish in comparison. Of course, this is a movie about the mafia from the working man/gangster point of view, where ""The Godfather"" was a mafia movie filmed from the viewpoint of the executive suite, so there really is no valid comparison there. ""Goodfellas"" really does seem ahead of its time when you realize that the only artistic work about the mafia that compares to it in quality is the HBO series ""The Sopranos"", which debuted nine years after this movie was made.""Goodfellas"" tells the real-life story of mobster Henry Hill, and it is largely true, although there are individual scenes that are out of sequence and others that were added for dramatic effect, such as Karen Hill flushing the cocaine down the toilet during the drug bust. Also, Tommy, the character that Joe Pesci played and the part for which he won an Oscar, was actually a composite of two separate gangsters. Other details are omitted completely, probably because they would have spun the movie off in too many different directions. For example, crime boss ""Big Paulie"" actually was having an affair with Henry Hill's wife, Karen. When Tommy tried to rape her and Paulie found out, that was when he alerted the Gambinos to the fact that Tommy had killed their missing crew member, ""made man"" Billy Batts, nine years earlier. This is the true reason that it took so long for Tommy to be killed over that incident. Thus, masterful direction of the story by Martin Scorsese in what was probably his finest film is why the audience has a more cohesive view of the mobsters portrayed in this movie than if we had been told every last detail.What really makes this movie great is all of the personal details that enable you to see these mobsters living a largely suburban life, concerned about kids' birthday parties and getting the sauce just right for dinner, and all the while completely immersed in a completely amoral lifestyle in which murder and bribes solve everything- a lifestyle to which they would never voluntarily choose an alternative."
24525,True,"Goodfellas makes you feel like you are watching guys that you know or knew. To this day, I have a friend that still talks like Jimmy Two Times.  He always says things like ""Nice Nice"" and that was just a background piece in Goodfellas.  But that is the point, all that is background is just as important as the main players and locales.  It all paints us a perfect picture of what mob life must be like.  And with all due kudos to The Godfather, but there is no other film that has ever made mob life look so real and feel so tangible the way Goodfellas does.To say that Joe Pesci is the best part of this film would be to discredit the rest of the cast, but at the same time, you have to mention him in some way.  His portrayal of Tommy is haunting.  Here is a man that is so insecure and wants to be the top dog, the made man so bad that he can't decipher between what is a joke and what is disrespect towards him.  Of course the scene in question is when he shoots a common boy for telling Paulie to screw himself after Paulie shot him in the leg.  You would think the guy has a right to let off a little steam and vent, but Paulie is always looking for the diss.  He is always looking to find some hidden gesture from someone that is putting him down.  Even at the beginning when he is getting on Henri in the now famous "" You're a funny guy "" scene.  He is kidding with Henri but deep down inside he is angry with him, you can see it and feel it.  Joe Pesci gave the performance of his career and he richly deserved to win best supporting actor that year.The story and script by Pileggi is sheer inside brilliance.  You can feel the inside observations that no one can have except for a guy that spent his whole life on the inside.  They ring so true and they get into your blood. From scenes like the fat guy running around delivering messages to the other mob guys because he doesn't like to use the phone to the scene when Henri, Paulie and Tommy have Billy Bats in the trunk but they stop off at Tommy's moms house for a late night dinner of pasta and such.  They also have to borrow a sharp knife to finish off the guy in the trunk, but to his mom they have to cut off the hoof of a dear that hit the car.  And the scene where Tommy does kill the young kid for joking with him and then Paulie gets mad at him, not for killing the guy but because he doesn't want to dig a hole tonight.  There are so many tiny observations in Goodfellas that give it the authenticity it has.  And it is a film that stays with you for years to come.  I think this is Scorcese's best film and although I understand and accept why the academy awarded Dances With Wolves the accolades it did, if this film would have swept the Oscars that year, no one would have been surprised.  It is a landmark film and I think it is one of the best films ever made.  And again, taking no credit away from Coppolla's Godfather epics, but this gets inside the mafia on a deeper level.  It goes one step beyond what Coppolla gave us, and for that Goodfellas should be remembered as the best film about gangsters ever made."
24526,True,"Overrated in 1990, *Goodfellas* has grown even more overrated with the passage of 15 years. It's based on the -- I daresay -- untrustworthy recollections of a half-Irish, half-Sicilian mobster-turned-informant who recently, I am reliably informed, appears as an addled, half-witted guest on ""The Howard Stern Show"". The narrative arc, if one can accurately term it that, spans 30 years, roughly from 1950 to 1980. This, of course, gives Martin Scorsese every incentive to soak the background with dozens of pop-culture tunes ranging from Bobby Vinton to Derek and the Dominoes. His use of the last 3 lilting minutes of ""Layla"" as some sort of ironic counterpoint in the extended montage that reveals the corpses of a dozen gruesomely executed mobsters in various places across New York City only underscores his utterly conventional taste in music. One wonders whether Scorsese would've been happier as a Top 40 deejay instead of a filmmaker.His conventionality -- a surprising development, given his success with such Seventies classics as *Mean Streets* and *Taxi Driver*, both infused with his uniquely individual aesthetic -- extends beyond the soundtrack to the actual movie itself. Lovers of this movie will doubtless be distressed to learn that the various stylistic techniques Scorsese uses here -- whip-pans, sudden freezes that supposedly add ironic punctuation to the narrative, even the use of pop music as commentary on a montage -- all derive from French (yes, I said French) auteurs from the New Wave school of the Sixties and Seventies. These same lovers of this movie would probably also consider Orson Welles to be an overrated old fuddy-duddy, but that doesn't stop Scorsese from pointlessly laying on at least two sequences of long tracking-shots through complicated spatial arrangements without cuts, the device Welles perfected if not wholly invented. (An even less impressive feat for Scorsese, who benefits from the technological advance of the Steadicam. Welles did it with old-fashioned cameras on dollies and hydraulic cranes.) I believe that all these borrowings betray Scorsese's fundamental, perhaps unconscious, lack of confidence in the power of his story, here.For the screenplay, let it be said at once, is poorly constructed. The narrative focuses on trivial events, like a gofer getting shot in the foot during a card game or Paul Sorvino slicing garlic to atomic thinness, and then presents the world-famous Lufthansa heist through hearsay. The movie's main character, Ray Liotta as Henry Hill, hears a news report about the heist while in the shower. One may reasonably ask why we're in the shower with Henry when we should be in the getaway car with Robert De Niro's Jimmy Conway and his henchmen. This, of course, leads one to reasonably ask why we're not watching a movie about Jimmy Conway instead of Henry Hill, the latter being, more often than not, on the periphery of the movie's main events. Having Liotta narrate the exciting stuff for us in voice-over is no substitute. Indeed, the movie is cripplingly dependent on voice-over narration, perhaps because Mr. Hill's own story, in and of itself, isn't interesting enough to really warrant a honest-to-goodness movie in the first place. As the movie drones on with Liotta's loquacious narrator ceaselessly filling in the narrative gaps, one suspiciously wonders -- for example -- why Hill and Conway are NOT whacked for bumping off ""made man"" Billy Bats, while Joe Pesci's Tommy DOES get whacked. All three men were involved in the killing, yet only Tommy pays the price. Why? Does Conway's and Hill's Irishness serve as a magical force-field? -- I don't get it. Well, I did say at the beginning of this review that Hill was an untrustworthy storyteller. From the evidence, it appears that Hill was quite conversant with his mob boss's cooking techniques (hence all the time wasted on cooking scenes and shots of gorgeously laid-out family feasts) and far less conversant with the important incidents that are the subject of this film. Note too how inconsistently handled Henry's character is throughout the film: one moment he pistol-whips almost to death a sexual predator who messes with his girlfriend, the next he's aghast when some punk kid gets carelessly killed. Hmm -- smells like self-hagiography to me.After an overly-edited, chaotic, 30-minute final act in which a sweaty-faced, puffy-eyed Liotta drives around the suburbs, peering up through his windshield at police helicopters, dropping off hot guns, going to the grocery store, zipping back home to make meatballs (AGAIN with the cooking!), and so forth, he gets pinched for good. Under the umbrella of the Witness Protection program, he finally rats out his mob bosses . . . and it occurs to us that this should have been the focus of the film all along, i.e., the FBI's successful eroding of the criminal code using Witness Protection. But Scorsese crams it in during the last five minutes of this 3-hour movie. A little less time in the kitchen and in the shower, and a little more time getting down to business, might have made this movie pretty great.As it is, the performers give *Goodfellas* undeniable energy, almost mitigating all its flaws. Fans of good New York actors will forgive this movie everything: Liotta, De Niro, Pesci, Sorvino, and Lorraine Bracco do THEIR job, at least. And perhaps this is why the movie is so well-loved. Colorful characters limned by great performances are entertaining. But, in my judgment, the virtues of verisimilitude can't overcome what amounts to a 3-hour-long non-story.3 stars out of 10."
24527,True,"I bought this film on DVD on the strength of two things - one, de Niro's excellent track record, and two, the very high rating on IMDB (in the Top 50). Having watched it, I have to ask what all the fuss is about? This is a very ordinary film which explores at extreme length the intimate details of the lives of the most childish individuals ever committed to celluloid. Whether or not people like these really exist, I found it completely uninteresting. I have no idea why so many people are fascinated by the mafia - maybe it's envy of the power - but they should not hold a fascination for civilised human beings. People who deal out death as a punishment for the slightest reverse in their lives deserve to be ignored or reprimanded, not lauded and celebrated as in this film. For every Henry Hill, there are a thousand or more kept in poverty because of the crime which supports his odious lifestyle. It would be nice to think there was some kind of a moral ending, but even then, we see Henry selling out his colleagues just to keep himself somewhere nearer the feeding trough.How anyone can rate this film so highly is beyond me; how so many of you IMDB browsers can and do, just beggars belief!"
24528,True,"Semi-spoilerOn a personal note...this movie was filmed, in part, in front of my family's home (the red house across from Bracco's ""home"" in the movie...you know the scene...Ray Liotta runs across the street and pistol whips the neighbor's son, who is polishing his red Corvette - since I was, in reality, the son who lived across the street, I suppose, that was me taking all that punishment).  Anyway, I was home visiting when they filmed for over a month on my street.  It was interesting to watch the care (bordering on fanaticism) that Scorcese took in endlessly rehearsing minor scenes and then finally filming them.  Which leads me to my point.  So much time, money, and effort spent to produce such an unpleasant film. Lord knows, it's not that everybody needs to be Pollyanna...we all are aware how truly wretched life can be...but why spend time watching loathsome, worthless characters act out pointless violence?  There just has to be some better way of spending our time.  Yep, we are base animals...as Scorcese incessantly likes to remind us in this and his other films...Thank you!  We get the idea!  However, why not take all that talent and time and produce something the uplifts the human spirit rather than denigrates it?  ""A man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for?""  Glorify gangsters, not me!OK...Goodfellas lovers...come on and pistol whip me...I'm waiting."
24529,True,"WARNING: FULL OF SPOILERS.Every single person in the world seem to love this movie, but I don't. I don't enjoy watching a guy killing everyone just cause he's a socially inept psycho, the never ending punching, alright, I got it, that's what the Mafia is all about, I already knew it. The deep-inside-good guy who in the end regrets about it all and sells out his partners. Terrific, I didn't see that coming from miles away. Oh, right, and before that, he cheated on his wife with prostitutes. How original is that? Even when it tries to be funny this movie fails miserably. From the great reviews it has achieved, I can see the world thinks it's amazingly original. Well I guess I'm missing it, and I'm happy I do. I want a plot, something that justifies all the blood, not just the ""he made me angry"". Hahaha, am I supposed to applause and enjoy, right? Yeah, Pesci's character is great, sure. Too bad he got murdered, isn't it?. That's the only part of the movie I've really enjoyed, actually. I would've loved to see him die with even more pain. That would've been great. I'll give the movie 2/10, just because they did shut that annoying dude up anyway. That adds one point. Martin Scorsese is the most overrated director ever, period."
24530,True,"This is actually quite a nasty film, with no likable characters at all - it's made from Henry Hill's perspective (played by Ray Liotta) but I didn't like him; I'm not sure whether he was supposed to come across sympathetically but he didn't to me.The film has some scenes of extreme violence, which I found pretty distasteful - watching someone get repeatedly graphically stabbed, having their head bashed in with a pistol butt, or having their head kicked in, isn't an enjoyable experience for me, call me weird.There is little plot to the film, and what there is is slow and drawn out. You don't really care what happens to any of the characters, in fact I wanted them all to be put behind bars personally! This film sends out entirely the wrong message: being in the mafia is cool, violence is cool, being a criminal is cool. The 'Tommy' character is especially nasty and violent, and some of his scenes provide for uncomfortable viewing.At the end of the film, Henry Hill avoids prison by ratting on his friends, not because of any high principles or because he's seen the light, but just to stay out of prison.I know it's probably news to some of the people who have given this film high ratings but violence and crime are not glamorous and not something to be celebrated.4/10 overall"
24531,True,"Goodfellas is the type of movie that has it all. Action, thriller, suspense and even some comedy thrown in makes this epic film the best of it's kind. The pace of this film is brilliant. There is no dull scene, no fillers and it leaves you completely entertained from start to finish. Joe Pesci is absolutely amazing and deserved the Oscar no question. You don't even have to be a person that likes gangster films to appreciate Goodfellas. If you were one of the people that found The Godfather to be a little slow or boring at times, I highly recommend this film as a substitute ""mafia"" film. You will definitely get your money's worth if you rent this one. Best film of the 90's without a doubt."
24532,True,"Goodfellas is a technically impressive film and interesting to review largely because of the huge following it has amongst film critics and Martin Scorsese fanatics alike, most of whom reverentially believe it is his best workand they may be correct.The story based on a novel by Nicholas Pileggi chronicles the rise through the ranks of the Mafia of Irish-Sicilian Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), who has always wanted to be a gangster since he was a kid, and finds his wish granted. We follow him from a rambunctious teen to his first arrest, his marriage to Jewish wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco) through to their fall into drugs, and finally as an informer prior to entry into the Witness Protection Program.The film has a dry sense of humor and is technically and visually amazing. Scorsese loves the mobster milieu and is obviously working in his element here with a nicely picked cast. The attention to detail, the camera work, the costumes, the choice of music is all well thought out to the most intimate minutiae. The film is a fairly fascinating peek at life inside the Mafia. Scorsese allows events to unfold believably and the moments near the end where Henry and Karen become increasingly paranoid that they are under surveillance, complete with jittery, over bright intense camera work that heightens their unease, is arguably some of Scorsese's best work.The acting is fairly solid. Liotta manages to hold things together as the focal character and he gets nice support from Bracco. DeNiro manages a dignified turn as Liotta's mentor and friend. Joe Pesci won the Oscar as the psychotic killer Tommy DeVito. He is utilized well enough here to overlook the fact that it is basically the same performance he gives in everything else.Yet as amazing as the film is, it still has its drawbacks that prevent it from becoming the classic that many of its admirers would have you believe. As fascinating as Goodfellas is, I actually find Scorsese's similarly themed subsequent work Casino just as impressive technically, yet far more interesting in that it tells its tale using the backdrop of the formation of gambling mecca Las Vegas. I realize that I am in the minority with that view, but there it is.Yet most notable of all is that Goodfellas seems utterly incapable of connecting on an emotional level with the viewer. The superior Godfather films featured similar themes and focused on characters capable of shocking acts of violence, yet managed to connect on an emotional level so that we had some concern for the players. By contrast, at the end of Goodfellas, as brilliant as I thought some of the direction and technical aspects were, I found that I did not give a damn what happened to any of the characters on screen, including Henry and Karen. I was completely indifferent to whether they lived, died, escaped, etc. And this issue makes for a somewhat empty viewing experience.1990 was a very interesting film year. Coppola released his last Godfather film that year. Although it got an Oscar nod, critics largely overlooked it in favor of Goodfellas due to the fact that it is not on the same level as its predecessors. There is no question Godfather III is a flawed film, but it is also more emotionally rich than Goodfellas and any one of its flaws is more interesting to discuss at length than any of Goodfellas successes. Conversely, critics and Scorsese fans have spilled gallons of ink over the ""injustice"" of Dances With Wolves winning the Best Picture over Goodfellas, but it is not hard to see why it did. DWW in its own right is just as technically impressive as Goodfellas (maybe even more so considering its director was an amateur with a passionate vision), but DWW connects emotionally with the viewer in a far more powerful way than Goodfellas ever does. At the end of DWW and Godfather III, I had to know what happened with those characters. At the end of Goodfellas, not so much. What Scorsese has achieved is certainly noteworthy and makes for a very good, solid gangster film, but most definitely not a masterpiece. It is slick, flashy and technically well done (sometimes even brilliant), but its inability to make me give a damn about any of its characters is a huge stumbling block."
24533,True,"Roebrt De Niro,Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci star in this film about the mob and gangsters in ""Goodfellas"". Based on the bestselling book of Nicholas Pillegi, director Martin Scorsese provides the viewer of a clear picture of what being part of organized crime is all about. Goodfellas is a true story that is being told on the eyes of Henry Hill,who spent 25 years of his life being a member of the mob from 1955 to 1980, until he became an informant and made deals with the FBI to bring down and put behind the bars his mob underboss Paul Cicero and his fellow mobster, Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway. The story whose script was co-written by Scorsese and Pileggi narrates Hill's story on how he started being of service with the mob when he was 12 years old when he considered being a gangster is better than being the President of the United States until he became a full-time gangster who was involved in extortion,hijacking,stealing,robberies and murders together with Tommy DeVito and Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway when he became an adult. It shows how much money he has had that made him and his wife - Karen Hill - have made their married life extremely comfortable,appealing and glamorous.Added to that,the viewer is treated to the glory years - the 50's,60's and 70's - of the mob when these crime families have many law enforcers in their pockets and how much impact they had in American society until they started to decline and experience downfall in the 80's when the FBI started to intensify their campaign against the mob and putting these mobsters into prison.No question that we have a great film.There are many reasons behind it.First,the viewer is given a clear portrait of the mob's way of life particularly the life of crime as told by Henry Hill.It definitely does not intend to put any glamor into their way of life as it clearly shows how violent this way of life is despite the money that they are able to earn.This was shown particularly in the scenes wherein Tommy DeVito,portrayed by Pesci in an Oscar winning role,shoots Spider on the foot and later killed him by shooting his chest six times after losing his temper.It also shows how much crime they commit in their daily life.Added to that,it also demonstrates how mob life has declined throughout the years starting in the 1980's when the FBI intensified in bringing down members of the mob and putting them behind bars with the use of advancement in technology that the Feds are using particularly in investigating mobsters. It definitely shows that the mob no longer has the same impact unlike during their glory years from the 1950's to the 1970's and the viewer probably laughing to Henry's mindset that being a gangster is better than becoming US President.Many will see that Henry himself became an FBI informant and corroborate against his fellow mobsters in the end receive lighter sentence instead of spending the rest of his life in jail.Aside from these reasons,we also get to see a lot of great performances from De Niro,Liotta,Sorvino,Bracco,who was nominated for an Oscar Best Supporting Actress; and Pesci,who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.In addition to performances,we also get to see a great direction from Scorsese that told the story in a fast pace that made 2 hour and 28 minute movie far from being boring; and a wonderful screenplay from Scorsese and Pileggi as well that made many scenes memorable up to day since this was first shown in the theaters many years ago back in 1990.No wonder the ""Goodfellas"" remains popular today since it was released 27 years ago."
24534,True,"Robert De Niro,Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci together with Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino star in this arguably greatest film about the mob - with respects to The Godfather saga particularly the first part - in this Martin Scorsese film based on the book written by Nicholas Pillegi's bestselling book ""Wise Guy"" known as ""Goodfellas"". It details the story of mob informant Henry Hill,portrayed by Liotta, about his twenty-five year life in the mob from 1955 when he was 12 years old until 1980 when he cooperated with the FBI that put his fellow mobsters into jail particularly Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway,portrayed by De Niro; and mob underboss Paul Cicero,portrayed by Sorvino.It details into Hill's criminal life that he is involved in like extortion,robbery,hijacking and murder. It also provides the viewer the benefits that entails being part of the mob like the amount of money they are able to earn and the ability to be given special treatment particularly not going in line at Copacabana as well as the respect they achieve from the people in the neighborhood.Many film viewers in the past have accused of The Godfather of glamorizing mobsters particularly the mafia Dons like Don Vito Corleone and his successor Michael Corleone particularly the first part.While I certainly do not agree with the critics considering that the movie has shown how mob life can destroy one's family as shown in the movie,Scorsese made it a point for viewers to see clearly in this film how disastrous mob life is all about. It really has shown the crimes that they are involved with as well as the fear and anxiety these people constantly feel considering their way of life wherein crimes and murdering people are a parts of their daily life. It has also shown how much it lost its appeal particularly during its decline in the 1980's when the FBI intensified its commitment of putting people involved in organized crime behind bars.We get to see how the main characters ended up getting murdered like Tommy DeVito,portrayed by Pesci in his Oscar winning performance or how they spent the rest of their life in jail just like Cicero and Conway; and how fellow members of the mob made deals with the FBI like Hill in order to corroborate against their fellow mobsters or friends in the crimes that they are involved in and enter a Witness Protection Program to protect them from the mob.After watching this film since its release 27 years ago while this review is written,I must say that it really could be considered the best film about the mob as it is based on a true story and a true account of mob life particularly the so-called foot soldiers a.k.a wise guys or better yet goodfellas who does hits for the mob instead of a fictional account about Dons or leaders of organized crime families in The Godfather saga.It also provides us how truly unappealing this way of life is especially now that the mob no longer provides that much impact in society and the advancement of technology that have benefited the FBI in terms of investigation of mobsters and the deals or programs that mobsters get into whenever they help the FBI in bringing down organized crimes.This film makes it clear in that regard unlike The Godfather saga considering that the mob are still in their glory years during the settings of the three part movies during the 50's,60's and 70's unlike this movie when it was released in 1990.Overall,Goodfellas shows that truth about the mob,its way of life, and its decline from the time it was released until the present time."
24535,True,"This film shows us a life lived to the excess. The tone of the film suggests more a study of social behavior than outright gangster film, I have even heard it being classed as a modern day noir, whatever, it's brilliant.The acting is amazing, the cinematography is top bracket, the music is heavenly (in it's depiction of Hell). Scorcese was born to make this movie, it's impossible to study it the first few times you watch because it sweeps you up and dumps you down at the end. It leaves you breathless. There is brutal violence, drug use, and colourful language, but there's no use complaining because this is the mafia, these are bad people, what do you expect? Told in flashback it is based on the story of Henry Hill, a boy who grows up dreaming of making it in the Mafia, he works his way into the higher ranks of the organised crime syndicate and through a stunning series of set pieces his coke-addled paranoia shows us his downfall and eventual fate. There are various voice-overs to give the action a sense of perspective, but there are so many things going on it's best just to let it flow.De Niro and Pesci are at the top of their game, and the supporting cast give this film a weight unmatched by many. As examples of perfection of the art of film-making go, not many texts can match Goodfellas, it's utterly enthralling."
24536,True,"I have nothing against gangster films and I love Deniro, and Liotta and Pesci...in moderation...The Godfather were brilliant films and I finally made my way around to seeing the infamously talked about 'Goodfellas.' I don't get it. I'll take the heat from any fans and I know there are scores of them...Goodfellas was average at best and simply a trashy look at a mobster from childhood to his end in the mob with some decent but over the top performance, brutally gratuitous language and violence. I suppose in some circles that equivalents to a great film but I need far more. I mean even the story has little depth to it and it's more or less an extended episode of The Sopranos without the character depth. I suppose after having the film hyped for years and hearing about the 'classic' I had high expectations but for me it was run of the mill, annoyingly loud and abrasive but with some good direction. Scorsese knows how to make an epic from beginning to end starting the film in the 50's and 60's and taking it all the way to the mid 80's is a challenge and he does it flawlessly. The gritty underworld, the dark lighting, the facial expressions all very good but put to a pointless story and sub par characters unfortunately.I finally know now why Ray Liotta is still around and still gets parts because I always found him a little obnoxious in roles and I never realized he single handedly headlined Goodfellas and is great at it. His character might be the only one in the film given any depth considering he is the narrator and focus of the film. Disgustingly Liotta got no nomination that year which is absurd because if this film deserved anything (which I don't think it did) Liotta's role was it. Robert Deniro commonly gets credit for the film as being the headliner which is also a bit absurd. He might be the big name for the film but his role was small. He didn't make a significant part in the film until a good hour into it and his role was small but he still certainly brought his Deniro class and style to the ensemble. I think they would have done better to focus more on his character and his relationship with Liotta's character. They had good chemistry but just when you wanted to see more...they moved on to something else. Joe Pesci was over the top insane, downright disturbed Tommy Devito. His performance in this film is legendary ""Oh you think I'm a clown?"" but to be perfectly honest he was ridiculous. His performance wasn't sincere or believable and he was downright annoying. He was loud and abrasive and his barrage of gratuitous language actually made the film less watchable and I am not against the use of four letter words in film but his was too much. Lorraine Bracco was quite good in her pre-Soprano role as Liotta's wife Karen who sticks with him through pretty much everything and has some powerfully emotional swings throughout the film. Paul Sorvino is good as the head of the mob family, Paulie, but he doesn't make an impact. You don't really believe anyone would respect him. He's quiet and laid back and basically hiding throughout most of the film. At least with Brando's Godfather he was an image, an icon, something you just were in awe of. The cast all work well together but their characters are so thinly written you just don't give a damn about a single one of them except maybe a little for Liotta's Jimmy Conway.I get that I'm in a severe minority speaking this way about this film and that director Martin Scorsese is like a god to some but I just didn't seem the talent in this film. Scorsese showed talent in The Departed and the cast was a million times better than Goodfellas and deserved all of it's acclaim but I personally think Goodfellas is more of a non-thinking man's mob movie where bloody brutal kills and 1000 times hearing the 'F' word would prompt a dull chuckle as though the audience were 10. No I am not trying to insult anyone I was just severely disappointed by this film after having expected a brilliant classic which I will say hands down is not the case. I suppose if you like the crime genre or moreso the gangster drama than you must see Goodfellas anyways but I can promise you there is FAR better out there than this average, poorly written film. 6/10"
24537,True,"I admit that I was a little disappointed with Raging Bull, and Taxi Driver was incredible, but Goodfellas is without a doubt Scorsese's greatest achievement. Every single, blood-soaked, foul-mouthed moment in this entire movie was made even better by DeNiro's and Pesci's performances and Scorsese's directing.After the opening scene when Tommy (Pesci) is stabbing Batts in the trunk, my eyes were glued to the screen; and for two and a half hours, I didn't even feel like I was watching a movie. The performances in this film by everyone are so thorough that it is impossible to tell they're acting. No other crime film has ever kept me entertained, interested and alert as long or as effectively as Goodfellas.After I saw the Godfather and didn't think it measured up to the hype at all,(it was still an amazing movie, don't get me wrong), I concluded that I was simply not a fan of gangster films. However, Goodfellas really changed my mind. Although it is not my favorite of all time, it has destroyed my indifference to this undoubtedly fantastic genre."
24538,True,"I can not believe the accolades this film received. I never saw it until today, so maybe I am tainted by the greatness of Sopranos and Godfather I & II.The acting was of course, stellar..but the story..the film...so amazingly dull and boring. I forced myself to sit through the entire thing. And when the credits started rolling I was like..what? That's it?? I now see where Sopranos got it's entire look and feel (and cast) and see now that Sopranos is essentially 'Goodfellas: The TV Series'.At least Sopranos did it right. They focused on the boss. The focus in this film of a boring two-timing drug dealer who is about as interesting as the wig commercial occurring during the film.I won't ever understand why people enjoyed this movie so much and hope all prints are destroyed for the good of humanity."
24539,True,"At a most general level the movie is about a dilemma of an average gangster. At certain point in his career if things go wrong, an average mobster faces a dilemma. A dilemma of becoming either a 'rat' or a 'martyr'.At the story level the most of the characters are all too 'rationalistic', in the sense that most of the time they are doing whatever they got to do to stay fit and survive. Probably the only exception is Tommy DeVito, whose overcompensating, psychotic aggression makes him the only interesting character. However, even in his case, the all too 'rationalistic' social milieu makes his fate far to predictable. Everybody except Tommy know the rules and know the limits. There are rules to rob, rules to kill, rules to betray and rules to go to jail. Tommy is the only person that challenges the order.Overall, contrary to romantic stereotypes, the portrayal of mafia world gives a picture of strict subordination and 'law-abidingness'. The story gives the picture of the mafia world that is exactly the opposite of what the narrator's childhood memories describe. What seemed to be the world of the free, daring and interesting, strong men, appears as a world of socially conditioned, 'rationalistic' and predictable world of predator mammals, who do whatever their dominant cultural environment permits or commands them to do."
24540,True,"Meet Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). He grew up in a marginal neighborhood on the Brooklyn - Queens line near JFK Airport. The neighborhood is working class but colonized by the mob. Local boss Paul ""Paulie"" Cicero (Paul Sorvino) superintends the neighborhood like a feudal lord.Paul Sevino carries the part of a low level mob boss with grace and dignity persuasively Italian without indulging in stereotypes.Though not eligible for induction into the ritual laden Italian Mafia, Henry Hill and his occasional co-conspirators Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) are allowed to hang onto the fringe of the high life of organized crime.Joe Pesci indulges more of the stereotypical Italian gangster: ruthless and earthy somewhat lacking in the class Servino brings to that role. Even though Pesci leans on certain stereotypes he manages to make a joke out of them. ""Imagine,"" Tommy Devito frankly observes, ""prejudice against Italians in this day and age."" But be careful not to laugh too hard with Tommy. He guns down a made Mafioso for indulging in fun at Tommy's expense.Tommy Devito, Jimmy Conway and Henry Hill may not be formally inducted Mafioso. They're called wise guys or goodfellas. While they're not official member of the Italian mob, they are involved in some of the major mob operations such as truck-jacking and airport heists including both the Air France and Luftansa raid.There are others at the extreme periphery of the mob including Morris 'Morrie' Kessler (Chuck Low) who furnishes comic relief right up to the point calculating Jimmy Conway decides to rub Kessler out rather than pay Kessler his share of the Luftansa heist.But money is not the sole object of the wise guys. Heck they blow it all on the track. It's the life.Declares Henry Hill, ""we're movie stars with muscle! Real life Italian - American Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill, the product of s strict Irish father and a saintly Italian mother well. Unlike his running buddy Tommy Devito, Henry has a certain charm he carries in the twinkling of blue eyes. He's one more likely to use persuasion than muscle when that's possible, but he's ready to administer a beating when that's required.As long as wise guys kick money upstairs to Uncle Paulie, life can be beautiful. There are certain bounds: No Drugs and the penalty is the ultimate one for violating this rule. Will the temptation to make the big money selling drugs bring the high life of the wise guys down?"
24541,True,"Martin Scorsese explores the life of organized crime with his gritty, kinetic adaptation of Nicolas Pileggi's best-selling Wiseguy in Goodfellas.It stars Robert De Niro,Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta.This is a true-life account of mobster and FBI informant Henry Hill,who happens to be a small time gangster that takes part in a robbery with Jimmy Conway and Tommy De Vito.His two partners kill off everyone else involved in the robbery, and slowly start to climb up through the hierarchy of the Mob. Henry, however, is badly affected by his partners success and decided to bring about the downfall of his mob partners.Goodfellas has one great achievement about organized crime and the mob.It portrays the benefits of being part of the mob and at the same time puts guilt upon them and never glamorizes them one bit.Also,it narrates man's constant lust for power and greed.Overall,this is one great crime classic."
24542,True,"I recently watched Goodfellas.This movie unlike The Godfather which shows the viewers and critics what mafia life is like higher up the ranks of mafia life. Goodfellas tells the viewers and critics what mafia life is like lower down the mafia food chain.Goodfellas also gives the knowledge that murder and other serious crimes in mafia life happens a lot of the time. When Billy Batts is murdered by a rage of fury from Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci); and when Paulie (Paul Sorvino) asks Henry Hill (Ray Liotta)did he know what happened to Billy Batts. And Henry replies with numerous incidents. The power expressed in the this movie is an outstanding feature of the brilliance of a Martin Scorsese's directing. Example: When an innocent young man called ""Spider"" is killed by Tommy. Another feature of which I noticed of Martin Scorsese's directing is that he can place the middle of the movie. This skill is also shown in Casino. Not many directors can do that, but Scosese does it perfectly in both Casino and Goodfellas.A sad part of mafia life is shown in Goodfellas, this is the fact that children such as : Henry Hill, Tommy and Jimmy ; when they are young can join the mafia.This movie is basically a biography of Henry Hill that an innocent young school boy is falling deeper into mafia life. He ended up doing a prison sentence for his love of mafia life. Even at the end court scene he still loved the mafia life even thought he nearly got killed for it. Even to this generation of movies getting greedier of special effects. The modern generation can appreciate film such as Goodfellas."
24543,True,"One of the best films ever made in every aspect. Very difficult to criticise, it truly is a gem for all gangster film lovers. Robert De Niro was masterful not even Pacino,Brando,Nicholson could have portrayed the character of Jimmy Conway as well in my opinion. The intensity and just utter brilliance that De Niro's ability brings to the character dose not allow you to look away from him. Few actors have that ability in my opinion, Brando and Pacino are two who do and who would have struggled to match De Niro. De Niro was supported well to say the least with great performances by Joe Pesci, Ray Liotta and Paul Sorvino. Every time you watch this film you see something different and it reminds you that this film is a masterpiece. Martin Scorsese had truly excelled himself in this film, he's created a benchmark for all future gangster films and to this day nothing has come moderately close. it amazes me how this film never won Best Picture at the Oscars."
24544,True,"Well everyone's telling it and I hadn't tried it once, not even in cable. So here's my two cents worth of it.Ray Liotta plays an Italian-Irish boy obsessed with becoming a gangster. While seemingly getting close to a certain ""main man"" in the streets, his dreams suddenly became a reality, getting friends with two gangsters, all the money, a wife and kids, even girls, fame and fortune, all that he wanted to be...until things gone haywire.I know Scorcese is a great director, but this movie seemed like a Raging Bull reunion with Pesci and De Niro, not to mention De Niro being worn out as a Mafia/local gangster in his role, and Pesci uncontrollable in his role that I can't seem to understand he began and end up that way. If I was a gangster, I never would had liked that guy to be met in the first place...and how did Liotta get close to him? The cinematography is too much pizazz by the 90's edge that it end up being boring in, like, more than 2 hours of it (the way Scorcese make his movies these days). Too complicated idea that Liotta's role end up seeking witness protection against his ""friends"". The only thing I was impressed is Paul Sorvino's role.I think Scorcese is starting to diminish his quality movie-making and style with this movie, focusing more on popularity of stars and movie length rather than a stylish, good story movie. I had much fun better watching Taxi Driver, King Of Comedy, Last Temptation of Christ, and my favorite, Raging Bull. I'm sorry for the negative criticisms on this famous movie, but that's how I see it in an unbiased way. Although Pileggi initially wrote the novel good, he edited it with boggleness for the movie, which, err, hadn't got better."
24545,True,"A fine tribal study of modern gangsterism in New York City. There are one or two allusions to being a ""made man"" but the words ""Mafia"" and ""Cosa Nostra"" never appear, though all the main figures are Italian, observe Italian moral codes, and occasionally lapse into the language of the Old Country. If you really want to be a member of the Goodfellas, it's not enough to be simply part Italian. You need to be ALL Italian, with traceable ancestry to the motherland, preferably Sicily.Everyone except some Federal Agents are corrupt. The wives know what's going on and are often complicit, though they have little to say about business decisions. They're satisfied with the solidarity of the larger family, the special parking places, the secret entrances to the Copacabana, the respect shown themselves and their well-groomed husbands, and the general opulence of their life styles. The girl friends enjoy many of the same privileges but are mainly the subject of jokes, which wives and children are not. Well, some are Madonnas and some are whores.The cops are partners in crime, whether the gangsters are on the streets or in prison. They become your major domos for a few cartons of cigarettes and an occasional big bill tucked into a shirt pocket. Your first jail term turns into a rite of passage, and you're given a celebration before you're packed off. The men clap and cry out ""Your cherry is broke now."" Prison itself is not a bad place if you're a wise guy. No one would dream of trying to rape you. You live with friends and share elaborate dinners and good wines with them.There are only two problems; one is interactional, the other moral and economic.As for the interactional problem, you can never really tell whether someone will become a ""rat,"" not even if you've known him all your life. From the point of view of a protagonist like Henry Hill, whose story this is, it's very bad to be a rat instead of a stand-up guy. On the other hand, it's much better to be a rat instead of a dead guy. Severe beatings are common, even for men who are no more than irritating or even for innocents like mailmen. And when an important deal is at stake, whacking is necessary.Whacking is also applied to men who unwisely insult others, because this is a culture of honor. It's like the Old West without Wyatt Earp. ""When you call me that, smile."" And sometimes smiling isn't enough. The derision must be clearly couched. Half a couch may not do. Personal affronts call for a passionate butchery, but business transactions are cold blooded and maximally effective.This social system is real enough. In certain bars in New York and New Jersey I was unwise enough to make some joke about Mafia hangouts and received warnings. And in Little Charlie's Restaurant on Kenmare Street in Little Italy, two tables were always kept empty in case some local businessmen decided to drop in unannounced.The movie is told from Henry Hill's (Ray Liotta's) point of view and he narrates most of it. Hill was half Irish and married a Jewish girl but was accepted, within certain limitations. That brings up the moral questions built into the film. These guys are friendly and generous to each other. But who pay for all that reckless spending? You and I. The gang isn't a charitable organization. Every time we buy something or rent an apartment, it costs a little more because of them, and they contribute nothing except mutual support.It's an immoral subculture in which the goals of society -- respect, wealth, material satisfaction, friendship -- are accepted, but society's means of achieving those goals -- following the rules, upholding the law, respecting the rights of strangers -- are rejected. The sociologist Robert K. Merton called them ""innovators"" and that's what they are. They invent and follow illegal rules for achieving society's goals. From an ethical perspective, it's a much better story than Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" series, which was an apologia for the Mafia, portrayed as a neighborhood organization that simply fills certain control functions that the regular police will or can not. No one was killed in ""The Godfather"" unless he was a coward and a traitor and deserved it. In ""Goodfellas"", a kid gets shot through the foot for being slow in delivering drinks to a table, and the incident is treated as a stupid joke. No one even TRIES justifying the act. When the same kid is later slaughtered for a resentful remark, the dead body is treated as a nuisance.The acting is unimpeachable, and so is the production design. You can almost smell the cigars, the perfume, the marinara sauce cooking in the large pot on the stove. (Everybody eats a lot in this movie.) You should definitely see it if you haven't already. It's naturalism is convincing and there is no Marlon Brando to sympathize with."
24546,True,"Spectacular. A well made feast of thirty years in the mafia. I usually think there's no such thing as a ten out of ten but this is an exception. I could not believe how well made this film. Martin Scorsesie uses the camera throughout the film like a genius. Joe Pesci plays an excellent performance as Tommy the loose cannoned killer. Robert DeNiro plays the Jimmy and it remains one of the best performances of his life but the performance of the film for realism belongs to Ray Liotta as Henry, the kid who started in the mafia as a young child and morphed into a middle aged coke head. This film is through the eyes of him in the mob for three decades observing every death, deal and wise guy in the deck. The how am I funny stuff is just classic, the spider fall is photographed brilliantly, and the narration is excellent. This film like none other, one that breaks rules by almost parodying the mob, This film is GOODFELLAS"
24547,True,"GoodFellas gets a 5/5 which does this film justice due to the amount of unique film techniques utilized by Martin Scorsese and the length of the movie that never seems to stagnant. The film manages to cover a two and a half decade timeline with the additions of narratives from two of the films main characters to pace the film correctly and fill in details that would've been impossible to inform us in 146 minutes or cover a 25 year timeline, which is integral when documenting a story of a character from childhood to manhood while including other aspects of his life.Narration/Voiceovers played an integral part in GoodFellas because this enables Scorsese to give us ample information in a short period of time, which is essential to keep up with the films 25 year span or else the movie would have to be much longer or we'd miss out on crucial details that drive the film. Continuing, the film revolves around Henry but it is crucial to know and understand what he's into and who his friends or the people he hangs around really are which would've been impossible without the narrative. Fortunately for the audience Henry is a reliable narrator so we don't have to question what he is saying because no one can tell one's story better them they can, this also adds the ability to add opinion without them being wrong because they're his own opinions.Next the narrative makes the audience gravitate towards Henry and helps the audience to understand his ways and see him in a better light and not have to make our own assumptions about Henry whereas we see him as a hero rather than an anti hero, With Henry explaining his ways it helps us look past his greed, drug abuse, and cheating because him explaining himself is almost like an apology or friend telling you why they do the things they do. Lastly The dual perspective also adds a flavor not many narratives add which is a female perspective in parallel to the main character.Furthermore the camera techniques used in this film are very different than an average cinematographers go to techniques. With the use of long cuts, freehand shots, and following movement during scenes this creates a genuine feeling and makes the film unbelievable realistic and intense. For example one of the most important scenes in the film from a cinematographic aspect is the restaurant scene when Henry and Karen walk from the street outside through a tunnel and walk through a kitchen into the restaurant and sit down all in one take and no cuts. Everything in the scene seems to flow fluidly and perfectly in cohesion with the two stars. The following of the character(s) by the camera adds a 3rd person spectating perspective that indulges you into the film and makes some seemingly pointless scenes interesting.In conclusion GoodFellas is a tremendous film directed by Martin Scorsese that utilizes many film techniques not used together often and creates a seemingly effortless environment while also being realistic to the audience. The theme of the film is surrounded in tragedy and misfortune. While we see Henry's rise in power within the mob, we inevitably see his fall towards the second half of the movie. With money,power, and greed even the mightiest may fall which is what we see scattered throughout the later half of the film."
24548,True,"""Goodfellas"" is a movie based on the life story of Henry Hill, played by Ray Liotta, and his involvement in the New York mafia. Henry's main partners throughout the movie are Tommy (Joe Pesci), James Conway (Robert De Niro), the boss Paul (Paul Cicero) and his wife Karen (Lorraine Braco). The movie revolves around a few different plot points as Henry moves through the mafia.At the beginning, Henry is a teenager and responsible for small things, such as parking cars or selling stolen property. As he grows up he becomes fully entrenched into the mafia. The film does a great job of showing the family atmosphere of the mafia, especially showing the distinction between their public marriage and their private affairs, or ""Fridays are for girlfriends"" routine. As Henry gets deeper into the drugs, you can see his physical appearance change. Their house, which was once very simply designed, becomes designed with wild colors and arrangements, representing the craziness of their lives. The settings continue to get more and more convoluted until he is finally arrested. As he has to choose between his mafia family and his wife and kids, you can understand how much he felt he lost - his entire identity.Another method that was extremely effective was that throughout the movie, Henry narrated, explaining different actions of the mafia, what things meant, and how he interpreted things. Karen also narrated at the beginning, explaining her attraction to Henry, but giving a vivid account of how she interpreted the mafia from the outside, showing how different the two views were at the time. This was in contrast to a similar movie series, ""The Godfather,"" where very little narration took place. Both were effective ways of communicating the action, however the narration in ""Goodfellas"" ensured that the audience knew what was going on the entire time, whereas ""The Godfather"" allowed the audience to make up their own minds.Overall, ""Goodfellas"" was an excellent film. The life in the mafia is always a bit of a mystery, and the film brought to light many different aspects of the life, from how they make money, to the killings, and their deep family life. The techniques the director used amplified in many ways Henry's life and his eventual arrest and the events thereafter. They helped form a bond with his character that almost made you feel sympathetic to him, and allowed the audience to really enter into the mafia lifestyle."
24549,True,"Great acting, good action scenes, but about 30 minutes too long. ""Goodfellas"" is basically synonymous with ""Casino"", and ""The Godfather 1, 2, or 3"", because they're all the same movie.  A bunch of mob guys running around, killing people, and they're all longer than they need to be.The best thing that can be said about this is that Joe Pesci dies.  He's got to be the most annoying actor.  The same goes for ""Casino"" (Goodfellas 2 as far as I'm concerned, they have so many actors in common).Scorsese should stick to movies like Taxi Driver."
24550,True,"Spoiler i dont really understand what all the fuss is over this film. yes, it is very good. but top 50 of all time good? oscar worthy good? no, i'd have to say no. while the first half is incredibly impressive, beautifully put together with wonderful acting. the second half starts to fall apart. the acting was very good, but impressive? outstanding? no, it didnt appear that any of these actors were actually pushing themselves or doing anything particulary fantastic with the exception of one or two scenes. my main problem with the film was the script. as i said, the first half was very impressive, but the last half just disintergrates. we barely find out anything about the wife after they get married. we dont even found out how deeply involved she is in the drug dealing or whether she knows about sandy. it is only at the last minute that we find out that she is on drugs as well. it is never really made clear why paulie is on trial at the end and there are numerous other plot holes which left me feeling cheated. it felt as if i was told part of the story and then the rest was just brushed over and forgotten. a great shame considering the brilliance of the first half."
24551,True,"I put a mark that this review contains spoilers; I didn't know first what is meant by a spoiler but found that it means that the review will talk about important events in the plot. I had to make the mark because I didn't and still don't know what are the main elements of this plot or even where is the story. The movie, as I see it, is focusing on unimportant events and manners. I'm afraid that if I didn't click that icon and talked about, let's say, any trivial thing in any trivial party in this trivial based movie; I would be put n the blacklist.IMDb is always the place I visit before watching any movie; most of the times, I find the rating of it's users rather useful; and some other times, it turns out to be a great shock after watching the movie. The latter case happened with ""Goodfellas"" as it happened with ""Godfather"" and some other movies. It's of course a difference of view points; but sometimes it is just confusing to me.I gave the movie three out of ten just because of the great cast and the good performance. As a regular watcher, I just see the performance, the story, and to a certain point: the direction. I like the movie to be entertaining; Goodfellas, n that respect, isn't the case at all; it's too boring for me to watch. I regret the past two hours I spent watching that movie."
24552,True,"Director Martin Scorsese's GoodFellas is an American crime film based on the non-fiction book, Wiseguy written by Nicholas Pileggi. Pileggi used real life interviews with Henry Hill to create Wiseguy. GoodFellas takes viewers into the world of real organized crime in the Lucchese family from 1955 to 1980. GoodFellas features an all-star cast of Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and Paul Sorvino. GoodFellas was convincing because it used a very established cast. De Niro had experience working in other mob films before such as The Godfather Part II where he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. De Niro, along with Pesci, worked with Scorsese before in his 1980 film, Raging Bull, where De Niro won the Academy Award for Best Actor.What Scorsese did extraordinary well with GoodFellas was creating a movie where the story was historically accurate with Hollywood drama that makes a film successful using engrossing characters and dramatic scenes. The story begins with Henry Hill (Liotta) who states, ""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster,"" which shows his admiration and eagerness to join to mob. Hill starts out as a boy who did errands for the mob organizer, Paulie. Soon Hill grows up to be a wise and willing mobster and it doesn't take long for others to notice him. Hill soon gets involved with fellow mobsters Jimmy (De Nero) and Tommy (Pesci), who steal, embezzle, and whack fellow mobsters. Scorsese makes us feel Hill's intoxication with this crime family. Hill is obliviously thrilled with the danger of being in the mob and he fully embraces it. Membership of course comes with a big price because the only way out of the mob is by going into hiding or death. When Hill says at the end of the film, ""I'm an average nobody. I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook"", moviegoers see how thoroughly he's bought into the mob mentality. He doesn't know how to live any other way, and he fears normal life.Scorsese's screenplay with GoodFellas was done in an innovative way because he wanted to make the sequences go out of order. When the film begins, a major whack scene from the middle of the film is shown at the beginning and the viewers don't know why. Soon the movie rewinds to the beginning and the scenes go middle, forward, and backwards. Scorsese wanted those scenes short and scattered because the impact on the audience later on would be terrific once everything soaks in. To add more authenticity, Scorsese wanted the movie's soundtrack to match the scene time periods. If a scene took place in 1971, you would only hear a song from that year or older such as Eric Clapton's, ""Layla."" Viewers who grew up in the 1950's though 1970's will enjoy the movie's nostalgic, classic rock soundtrack. GoodFellas does not fall short on violence. No actor in the film better depicts a better example of a cold mobster than Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito. As Tommy, Pesci shows us how psychopathic mobsters see the world and how they treat the people in it. The way Tommy casually whacks people will have a memorable impact on the audience and put more fear of the mobsters into them. Pesci truly has you believing he is a narcissistic, maniac. GoodFellas accomplished exactly what it was set out to do. Scorsese wanted to take real life crime events based on Henry Hill's interviews from Wiseguy and incorporate it into film where everyone could see just how the mob functioned in the mid-to late 20th century. GoodFellas is a prodigious achievement that puts this film into the categories of one of the best mob movies of all time."
24553,True,"Goodfellas is lauded as an amazing film, better than The Godfather and possibly the greatest mobster film of all time if not the greatest overall film. This is ridiculous.Our protagonist, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), says he always wanted to be gangster. When he joins the mob, he and his friends experience the high-standard and high-risk life of gangsters. So the film follows his new life till its end.I'll agree the directing and writing was impressive. Acting was well-performed too. The narrative told through the voice-over of Henry Hill and occasionally his wife (Lorraine Bracco) is enjoyable and the general progression of the storyline is good. Nice pacing, etc. I was definitely interested and the movie kept me submersed.The biggest problem with this film, for me, were the characters. Almost none of them were likable. Henry Hill was a drug-addict, and sold drugs even though his long-time friend and boss Paulie Cicero specifically told him not to. Hill constantly gets into arguments with his wife, once threatening to kill her, and yet constantly cheats on her. He's always going on about how regular people are losers who don't know how to get on in life and acting like they deserve to have their livelihood taken from them. That's another thing: he steals whole shipments from truck drivers and airports.Now I like gang movies as much as the next guy. The same goes for dark, depraved films. They're interesting. But I finished this movie with a unsatisfied, irritated feeling. I don't know how anyone could like these characters. By the end of the film I was waiting to see them all get their comeuppance. Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) is a maniac. He kills people left and right and for just mildly insulting him. He brutally murdered his life-long friend Billy Batts. Tommy shot and killed a kid because the boy told him to ""go f*** yourself"" and that was because he had already been shot in the foot by DeVito and the man just kept making fun of the kid. Sure the boy (his name was Spider) wasn't a teenager, but he was definitely in his twenties, probably early twenties. Not to mention Morris Kessler and that other guy from the restaurant. DeVito owed both of them money and when they patiently asked for it, he killed one of them and nearly killed the other. I wasn't sad when DeVito got ""whacked"" instead being made. I only wished his death was a little more painful instead of a simple shot to the head.Anyway, Henry's wife Karen was also a bit of an jerk. She also threatens to kill him, and while most of her motives are reasonable, she doesn't have many redeemable traits. The same goes for pretty much all of the other main characters. Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) was unlikable and trigger-happy. Paulie was probably the only main character who wasn't a complete jerk. He, at least, had some common sense.I know this is a gangster film, and this is based on real-life events and maybe its bleak violence could be considered ""edgy."" But this is definitely not better than The Godfather or other gangster films like The Untouchables. At least the characters in The Godfather were likable. They had a sense of honor and reason. I liked Vito Corleone, I liked Michael and Sonny and a bunch of the other characters. When they killed, it was for a better reason than these lunatics. When some of them got killed, I felt sad for them.I guess the movie's overall production value is good, but it doesn't redeem it and it certainly doesn't make it better than The Godfather. If you're going to make characters who do horrible things, you have to do it for a better purpose. There needs to be depth or reasoning. This whole thing was needlessly mean-spirited. For me, the despicable characters ruined the whole experience. For you, it may not. That's just my opinion."
24554,True,I really enjoyed this movie about the mob that took place in the 1960s Robert De Niro was a good mob boss that's his little sidekick Joe Pesci I think it was one of their best films to date I really recommend this film for adults I don't recommend it for children at all too much violence I gave it 9 Stars
24555,True,"As far back as I can remember, this has been one of my favourite movies. This is a brutally honest and authentic depiction of the Mafia in New York and how they got their fingers in every pie available. The story is told mainly through the eyes of Henry Hill, who we see go from impressionable child to career criminal and finally a beleaguered nervous wreck. Ray Liotta turns in his best performance in the role, Joe Pesci likewise as Tommy DeVito is brilliant in his genuinely terrifying performance of the unstable and merciless mobster. Robert De Niro, although not as psychotic is just as ruthless and frightening in his part as Jimmy Conway, the mob enforcer who could easily be shaking your hand one minute, then shooting you in the head the next, as shown when he has most of the crew who helped in the Lufthansa heist murdered without so much a second thought. The rest of the cast are also brilliant particularly Lorraine Bracco as the impressionable wife of the mobster who finds herself at first attracted by the life and then terrified of it, and Paul Sorvino as the ultimate Mob boss who can bring people into line with just a look. Special mention for Frank Vincent, who, although not in the movie for very long turns in a memorable performance as Billy Batts whose arrogance would end up costing him dear. Goodfellas shows every aspect of the life of a mobster, including its dark and ugly side which shows how high the price can be for the perceived glamorous lifestyle, so I don't agree with the train of thought that it glamorizes organised crime, and its depiction of the lifestyle is feels very real and authentic. This movie is a definitive movie of the ages and one of the best ever made."
24556,True,"One has to wonder where cinema would be without this movie. In just 2 and a half hours, Scorsese cemented himself as the king of mob movies. ""Goodfellas"" also managed to tell a great inside story to the inner workings of the golden age of crime. An age where mobsters could and would get away with almost anything. Everyone puts in great performances, the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic, and it has one of my all time favorite movie scenes in it, a scene I've dubbed ""Layla"". If there was one problem I have with the movie though, it would have to be the ending. To me, the ending has always been anticlimactic. Once Henry starts talking to the investigator about going into the WPP, the movie almost enters fast forward. Everything before that was paced out great, but it feels like they squished a 20 minute climax into 6 minutes, almost like they were told to ""hurry up and finish"". It's a little hard to explain, and might sound like I'm just complaining to complain, but it really does bother me. It's solely because of the ending that I don't think this is Scorsese's best picture. Aside from that though, the movie is absolutely worth a watch."
24557,True,"Goodfellas has it all a solid story, terrific actors, and music to help fit with the mood, help make it one of the greatest movies of all time. With the viewer actually feeling bad for these bad people. As you see Ray Liotta's character enters a world of luxury, he sees the downside of what that life has on him and his family. This movie is definitely a home-run for Martin Scorsese. Especially this film will keep you entertained until the end and will answer all your questions. For a terrific performance,Joe Pesci earned himself an Oscar award for his supporting rule as Tommy DeVito, who is a psychopath you come to like by the end of the movie as he meets a fatal death. Martin Scorsese gives you twists and turns that will make you keep watching this movie over and over again"
24558,True,"Martin Scorcese's ""Goodfellas"" is the true story about Henry Hill, and his 30 years in the mafia. Lets be straight. I have seen a lot of different movies through my time, good and bad, touching or disgusting, but this one takes the price. It's safe to say that this incredibly well directed and well played movie is my personal favourite.Starting from the beginning, we se three guys, that is Henry and his two friends, driving a car on the highway in the middle of the night. Seems first like any other trip, but suddenly there is a strange noise coming from the car, and Henry turns to his friends. At first they all seem uncertain, but when they pull over, they all know where the sound is coming from, the trunk. We now witness the first of many coming violent scenes, as this is when they finish the job of getting rid of a mob-boss that they got in an argument with. After the brutal killing act, we get thrown into the magical but yet horrifying world of the mafia, and Henry Hill, played by the actor Ray Liotta, starts to tell his story. We start in the 50's, how Henry first got connected, and then the whole movie follows his career through out the years. We witness the ups and downs of being a wiseguy, someone in the mafia.I think what I most like about ""Goodfellas"" is that Henry is narrating throughout the movie. That is a concept I am very weak for when they use in movies, because it feels like you are in the movie with the main character, and that he in some way is communicating to you, It increases your connection and helps you to bond and feel sympathy for the character, no matter what kind of person he is. Throughout the whole movie, no matter what he does, Henry has my sympathy and I route for him. I want him to succeed and don't care about the others. Because he briefly manages to convince you that life in the mafia is something glorious, that you have power, money, and respect, and you almost fall for it, The first half of the movie Scorcese puts in flashy 50's and 60's music, and creates a world of luxury built up by corruption and violence, but everything has its price. Goodfellas is actually based on a true story. Almost everything in the movie has happened, and it is shocking to se how all the characters are willing to cross all lines in order to establish the kind of world and lifestyle that they want. Henry and his friends are willing to stop at nothing to get what they want, and that is also a point that Henry makes us very clear with in the beginning, that you take what you want in the mafia. It is a very tempting idea at first, but when you ask yourself truly what that really means, its like you wake up from a dream and realise what in gods name you are thinking. Every scene is well made, and Scorcese uses his well developed directing skills as he captures the perfect moments. A lot of scenes illustrates a flashy and fun part of being in the mafia, while other scenes later in the movie breaks the good image and gives you the chills. Often when someone later on becomes hurt, but the best part is when you anticipate something, and it turns out totally different. Every character has a different fate in this movie.Its also safe to say that Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci manages to capture their roles outstandingly good, along with Ray Liotta. There are a lot of powerful scenes and great acting and integrating between the characters. They are so well played that you would not be surprised if any of them had a mysterious and haunted background. I have to mention the scene where Liotta and Pesci integrate, at a restaurant, and Pesci manages to fool not only the audience, but also Liotta himself and the people around them. Everyone thinks for a moment that Liotta is dead meat and and that he has isolated the short tempered Pesci. Outstanding. The scene was also improvised. Until the very end, Goodfellas stays at the same level of perfection. I can only hope that that this will always remain among the most watched movies, and that everyone sees this at least once. Because it is vital to ask yourself, what am I willing to do for money and power, and what price would I be willing to pay?"
24559,True,"The movie, Goodfellas, is the true story of Henry Hill, a former American mobster. Henry (Ray Liotta) was born into a working class family in Brooklyn, New York. Henry knew from an early age that he wanted more out of life than simply struggling to make ends meet. When, as a teenager, he had the opportunity to run errands for the Lucchese crime family as a means of earning money, he immediately got a taste of the life he so desperately wanted to lead. Henry dropped out of school to begin working for the Lucchese crime family full-time. After his first arrest, Henry learned the most important rule of living life as a mobster: ""Never rat out your friends, and always keep your mouth shut."" Henry quickly made his way through the ranks of the Lucchese crime family, and became very successful in his new career. Henry eventually spends time in prison, and ends up getting involved in a side business of selling drugs, which went against the wishes of the Lucchese crime boss, Paulie (Paul Sorvino). In the end, Henry is forced to turn against his crime family, and leave the mob life that he always wanted to lead in order to save his own life. Goodfellas depicts the rise and downfall of Henry's mob career, and the demise of his way of life.The theme of Goodfellas is a focus on the character development of Henry Hill, and his desire to live life as a rich and successful gangster. The storyline is presented as a linear flashback of Henry's life, narrated by Henry himself. Henry believed that ""being a gangster was better than being the President of the United States."" It was the only thing that he ever wanted to do. Henry believed that being a gangster would allow him to achieve the highest level of success that he valued most: respect. Henry wanted desperately to be ""a somebody in a neighborhood full of nobodies."" The desire to have the respect of those around him was Henry's motivation to become a gangster.Henry admired the mob boss, Paulie, for the respect that he garnered  the respect that Henry so desperately wanted to attain. Henry began working at the cabstand and the Pizzeria that Paulie owned, and worked through the ranks of the Mob's organization, from parking cars, to making deliveries, to carrying out important tasks. Henry liked the respect he received from others in the neighborhood due to his association with top gangsters. He stated, ""People looked at me differently, and they knew I was with somebody. I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery on Sunday morningthe owner knew who I was, and no matter how many people were in line, I was taken care of first."" Henry's motivation was the respect that he earned in being a gangster.Henry's compulsive desire for money, social status, and success led him to start a side business of drug dealing, which was something that Paulie strictly forbade, and went against his ""family."" Eventually, Henry gets busted for dealing drugs, and the police have enough evidence of his involvement with drug dealing that he is looking at a life sentence in prison with no parole. Paulie becomes angry because Henry had lied to him and disobeyed his command to stop the drug business. Paulie tells Henry that he has to turn his back on him, meaning that his relationship with the Lucchese crime family is over. Knowing that he, Karen, and their children are marked targets, Henry saw no other choice but to break his trust with the Lucchese crime family and enter the witness protection program so he could divulge information about his dealings with the mob. If he didn't, Henry knew it would just be a matter of time before he and his family were killed. In the end, Henry lost his trust with the people he had worked with for a lifetime, and was forced to turn his back on them, and more importantly, the life he loved the most. He was forced to break the most important rule in the life of a mobster  never rat out your friends, and always keep your mouth shut.The use of cinematic techniques help to define Henry's character throughout the movie, and support the theme of the rise and fall of Henry's mob career. Director, Martin Scorsese, used unique camera angles to show the development of Henry's character, and the rise of Henry's mobster status. In the first scene that reveals an adult Henry, the camera angle is shooting Henry from the bottom, looking upward, giving Henry the appearance that he is larger than life, and has been raised to mobster status. Another cinematic technique used to further develop Henry's character is through the viewer gaining insight into Henry's internal actions. The entire film is told through Henry's perspective, and the viewer has insight into Henry's deepest thoughts about his own actions and the actions of those around him.Goodfellas is a study in how Henry's greed and desire for status and respect ultimately leads to his downfall. For Henry, even harder than breaking trust and turning against his crime family, was the loss of the way of life he had become so accustomed to, as Henry states in the final scene:The hardest thing for me was to have to leave the life. I still love the lifeAnd now, it's all over.There's no action  I have to wait around like everyone else I'm an average nobody. I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook.Henry lost everything he had ever wanted out of life. As the movie fades, you see the end result of Henry's deal with the witness protection program  living in suburbia, he is now forced to live the boring life of the people he used to mock  the life of a schnook."
24560,True,"Simply a classic mobster/gangster movie. Killing, stealing, dealing, and drugs. All the makings of a great movie of this kind. The violence was awesome, and still not too overbearing. Ray Liotta has taken over as one of my top actors. But not only is he great, but his supporting cast may be even greater, seeing as Joe Pesci won best actor in a supporting role at the Oscars a decade-and-a-half ago. This is also a great example of a kid who grows up into the wrong crowd to eventually make his way out, realizing his moral mistakes. It was great to see something different in the end, rather than everyone getting locked up. Where it was tough to watch Henry bail his peers out, it was still good to see something different. Great movie. Must see."
24561,True,"Possibly, the greatest gangster film of all time, everything is perfect; the acting is perfect, the script is perfect, the story is perfect, this is one of the first examples that comes to mind when I think of a perfect film.The performances where outstanding and I would not have been surprised if all the cast received Oscars. The soundtrack (though, not a conventional score) was still very just as (if not more) effective than a score. The angles, and editing and cinematography where all terrific.Overall, Goodfellas is Scorsese's best film by a long shot, which is saying a lot. This is a film I could watch again and again and again. This film is definitely not for everyone but fans of films such as Wolf of Wall Street and American Hustle will definitely love this."
24562,True,"Movies about the mob have been part of cinema history for decades, but never was life as a mobster made to look more glamorous and more alluring than it was presented in Martin Scorsese's 1990 masterpiece Goodfellas, a sweeping cinematic epic that spans several decades in the lives of a select group of men working their way up through the social strata of the syndicate.The film opens on the childhood of one Henry Hill (a real person BTW, who is now in the Witness Protection Program), a teen who started his career with the mob as an errand boy and was paid handsomely for his efforts. It's a little unsettling the way the mob draws Henry in and makes what he does seem so glamorous and exciting, but Nicholas Pileggi's screenplay brilliantly shines light on the allure of life in the mob. Even though we know it's wrong, the way the director and screenwriter make it completely understandable. There's something rather pathetic about the fact that when a teenage Henry is arrested for the first time, the fact that he keeps his mouth shut about his employers, makes him the new hero of this dangerous inner circle and that he will be protected by them for life.The inner circle includes a couple of career mobsters Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci) who take the adult Henry (now played by Ray Liotta) under their wing and the sometimes conflicted emotions Henry goes through when he realizes some of the things that are required of him. The movie's opening is proof of this as we see Jimmy, Tommy, and Henry in a car with a body in a trunk which they are preparing to bury somewhere in New Jersey. Despite the rampant ugliness that is a part of this life, the perks seem to outweigh the ugliness for Henry until he is in so deep that he can't get out, to the point where his job has direct correlations to the Don, Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino) who treats Henry like a son until he learns that Henry has branched out into his own side business that has threatened the primary business and everyone involved.Scorcese has created a world that looks impossible to resist and it is very easy to understand how Hill got pulled in, and as we all know, once you're in, you never get out. Eventually, Henry was in so much trouble, his only alternative to being whacked was selling out.The cast is absolutely perfect, led by De Niro as Conway and a star- making performance by Ray Liotta as Henry Hill. Liotta is sexy and charismatic as Hill and no matter what Hill does, Liotta always makes the viewer sympathize with Henry, no matter what he's going through. Joe Pesci won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his outrageous performance as Tommy, which produces equal doses of laughs and chills, whether he is amusing cronies with wild stories, beating the crap out of old buddies, or borrowing a shovel from his clueless mom to help bury a body in the trunk of his car while he is at mom's dinner table eating pasta. Lorraine Braco received a supporting actress nomination for her fiery performance as Karen, Henry's wife who turns a blind eye to what her husband is doing because the perks for her seem to be even better than the perks Henry gets. Paul Sorvino commands the screen as Big Paulie and Catherine Scorsese (the director's mother) is adorable as Tommy's mother.Scorsese's cinematic eye for violence and shock is in full view here, creating a glamorous look at mob life that doesn't minimize the violence and ugliness that comes along with it. The art direction and divine musical score also deserve mention here. The film and Scorsese were both robbed of Oscars...in a word, a masterpiece."
24563,True,"There is neither glorification or criticism of the gangster lifestyle in Scorsese's Goodfellas, despite the opening lines of Henry Hill's narration. At times it can seem almost alluring and seductive. Take the character of Karen for example, played excellently by Lorraine Bracco. One can pinpoint the approximate moment in which she becomes swept up in the lifestyle of Henry (Ray Liotta), right when she decides to hide a bloodied gun rather than go to the police as ""other girlfriends"" would do. Her voice-over from her first appearance is one of the film's only real insights into Henry's world from the outside world. From then on it's a slow process as she is swallowed into her husband's life. Some of it is subtle, like the line about the bag of money at the wedding and how no one would dare steal from the Mafia. In other instances she's shocked at what she's gotten into as we wake to see an extreme close up of a gun barrel pointed directly at the camera before she breaks down and realises she cannot do the deed. One of the film's pivotal and most famous scenes is the long tracking shot that takes us through one of Henry and Karen's first dates. They bypass the waiting queue for a nightclub, entering via the service corridors and travel through the kitchen and right up to the stage where they immediately are presented with front row seats and a table. The magic of this shot as Henry greets acquaintance after acquaintance illustrates the lavish lifestyle and prestige of his position even at a young age, and seduces us like it seduces Karen. In a similar scene, we are presented with Henry's POV as the long take and voice-over narration combine seamlessly to introduce us to Mafia members in a bar. The camera-work is slow, deliberate and precise; each member is hinted at being their own fleshed out persona, each with their own powers and lives, yet for Henry it's a very familiar process. The select few Mafia members that are shown to be in close correspondence to Henry are Tommy (Joe Pesci) and Jimmy (Robert De Niro), the three of them taking care of business in the opening scene. The ease in which the violence and brutality of their work slips between their mundane lives humanises and establishes the main characters as a family. One moment they are finishing off a murder and digging a hole for the body, the next they are having a meal with Tommy's mother. The opening of the film sharply paints a contrast when it is later revealed what they have done and where exactly they got the knife from. Compare the harsh ominous red lighting of the digging scene to the naturally calm dinner with Tommy's mother. The film's dialogue also makes similar comparisons which highlight the notion of family. There's a brief moment of tension between Tommy and Henry who comments on his ""funny"" nature, the same comment later mirrored as Tommy takes offense to Billy Batt's ball bustering. One ends in laughter, the other murder.Even in prison, a usually dark and dismal location, their ties are are strong as ever. They live like kings inside, getting regular shipments of fine gourmet food from bribed guards: bread, salami, prosciutto, cheese, scotch, wine. It's arguable one of the film's calmest moments, the soft jazz vocals of Bobby Darin's Beyond the Sea accompany the scene as the four sit down and dine on better food than many on the outside can afford. It's just one of the many perfect choices of music Scorsese uses to add information and mood to the film. Later, as Jimmy begins to cut ties and whack the people involved in the Lufthansa heist, the heavy and bitter-sweet chords of Layla's piano segment signal the beginning of the end. Scorsese's use of freeze frames at vital points of Henry's journey, and the imposing dolly zoom near the end of his mafia life add additional subtext. Goodfellas covers a great deal of time from the early deliveries of a young Henry, to his marriage and rise up the gang, to the 4 years he spends in prison and the growing up of his kids. So it's a little jarring as a sequence near the end depicts a whole day of his life and responsibility. Gone are the long and graceful shots of his luxurious lifestyle. His hair is not slicked to the side and his face shows visible signs of ageing and of course drug abuse, which leads the audience and even Karen to believe his paranoia is from that source. It's a very stylish and frenetic sequence; the edits seem to jump quicker and between locations at a moment's notice, the narration of Henry is suddenly a tiny bit faster and there's almost a slight fisheye lens effect as we slowly close into his character. The walls of the frame seem to squeeze Henry as he rushes from chore to chore; gun deals, snorting cocaine, another gun deal, check on the sauce, mix the cocaine, check on the sauce again. Work and life mixes together as Henry struggles to maintain his standard of living he has become so accustomed to. The sentiment is echoed most prominently in the end. Henry gets up from the witness stand, walk across the courtroom and breaks the 4th wall as he directly narrates to the camera; ""I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook."" It's the high highs and the low lows of the gangster lifestyle that he craves even in the relative safety of the witness protection program. His comment on ordering spaghetti and getting egg noodles with ketchup is particularly telling: even in prison he ate much better and it's exactly in that world where he feels most comfortable. For that, Henry would do it all over again."
24564,True,"GOODFELLAS is almost 25 years old, but I don't think there's been a better mob movie since. This movie does a terrific job showing the flash and allure of being a successful mobster (the cash, the respect, the twisted sense of family) and then the dark and dirty side - the graft, lies and ferocity. Liotta's fall is as rough as his rise is seductively entertaining (think SCARFACE, only a whole lot better) and it's punctuated by brutal acts of violence.Overall, a great movie; features an immersive soundtrack, half the supporting cast of THE SOPRANOS, and Lorraine Bracco, who just radiates sassy broad. And lest I sinfully forget: Joe Pesci, whose savage hothead character lends this movie its dark humor. He moves from butcher's knife to gun (several) to ice pick and it's always somehow funny. He lights up the screen in this movie; it's an amazing performance.8/10"
24565,True,"Goodfellas is the best film I have ever seen. This is what I thought as soon as I watched it. You will laugh, and be silent. You will lose your breath and be sucked into this world.Goodfellas is one of those films that's so masterfully made, that you want more, you want to see these characters scheme for hours, you want to listen to voiceovers about the gangster life forever. From the very first moments, you know the film will be brutal, yet relentlessly entertaining. The story revolves around Henry Hill, a real life gangster, whose rise and fall is told in excellent Scorsese fashion. With voice-over, freeze frame, tracking shots and Robert DeNiro all making an appearance. But with expert direction and great acting all round, who is the star of this film but Joe Pesci, whose psychotic endeavours always make me laugh at killing. Because of the way it's executed. Other highlights include the April 27th 1980 scene which is the best montage of events I've seen in film. Overall, I will say watch Goodfellas now, because when it's over, you will miss it..."
24566,True,"*WARNING: SOME SPOILERS ARE CONTAINED IN THE REVIEW BELOW*What's so great about being a gangster? What are the perks? Well, if you're a ""goodfella"" or one of the ""wise guys,"" you'll be able to let everyone know. Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990) is by far one of the greatest gangster movies made today. Scorsese is the director of other films such as Shutter Island, The Departed, and Wolf of Wall Street. Along with these great films, Goodfellas has received many awards, including an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Scorsese is able to bring the element of fear to the audience, but at the same time allows them to emphasize with a group of gangsters. Watching this film, I realized that it doesn't have a structure. There is no concrete beginning, middle, or end, which is what keeps the audience tuned in throughout a long movie such as this one. The start of the film begins with a scene that likely (and as we find out later, does) come during the middle of the movie. We are started off with three of the main characters, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) driving in a car with what we discover is a dead body in the trunk, followed by the voice of a young Henry Hill saying, ""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster."" This background narration of his voice foreshadows that he is going to take us back to square one, to the days that he knew he wanted to be one of them; part of the mafia.The cinematography of the film is what creates the elements and moods that the audience feels while watching the film There are many scenes in the film that are long shots; which are shots taken without any editing. Watching a film, that foremost, is considered to be more of a story than have a plot line, is much more interesting to watch through long shots. These shots are able to make an audience feel more connected to the characters in the film. The audience is able to follow different characters in the film and see exactly what they are doing, where they are going, and who they are dealing with, all in one shot. What really kept me interested in Goodfellas is how hard it is to determine who are the protagonists and who are the antagonists. I enjoy a challenge and I enjoy watching a movie that makes me think. Since the film is so long, and there are only so many main characters, it takes a longer time to unravel their secrets, personalities, and lifestyles. After watching the entire film, I left still not knowing for sure if I would consider any of the characters to be protagonists. Throughout the film, we see nearly each character either; steal, murder, do drugs and/or make all sorts of illegal deals. Then again, this is what kept me on my toes. This is why this movie is different from all of the others. There doesn't have to be a specific hero or villain. It's truly depicted on how the audience interprets the movie. You are never completely positive which person was doing the right thing in any situation. Another thing this film does wonderfully is provide a great social commentary about the mafia versus the government. Considering that this movie is based off a true story and book; Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family; it is considered to be a semi documentary. Containing some truth and factual details to the events in the film; it is able to shed light on the inner networks of the mafia. We, as an audience, are able to see inside a group that most people would fear, but as we watch we consider emphasizing with them instead. We see how the mafia is intertwined with small businesses, big businesses and especially the government. It was complete corruption. During the final trial scene with Henry Hill testifying against his longtime friend, Jimmy Conway, Hill makes a comment where he admits that they paid off policemen, lawyers, and judges. They got away with everything because they were feared by everyone around them. The entire movie revolves around the commentary that all outsiders feared them, but once you were in, you loved them, and they were family. By the end, I left the film not sure whether or not I should feel bad for the gangsters who were murdered, sent to jail, or sent to the witness protection program; or whether I should have been happy justice was served. That feeling that I had was exactly why I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to think critically; to anyone who appreciates a challenge with their inner-self while watching a film. If you appreciate action, violence, loyalty and betrayal, love and unfaithfulness; this movie is calling your name."
24567,True,"Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and an outstanding job from Ray Liotta. ""Goodfellas"" has everything that says priceless, as well as adding some new values to the lifestyle. Dare I say it modernises both the look and era of the genre, to which many still consider it the best gangster flick to come out since ""The Godfather"" (1972). It's a bold statement, and I just don't think it's that same level of good. Still pretty fantastic regardless.As story goes it's pretty strong. Based on the real events of gangster-turned informative Henry Hill (Played by Liotta), it tells his story of growing up in organised crime and his somewhat ""initiation"", that ultimately leads to him meeting Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway (Robert De Niro), and loose cannon Tommy DeVito (An Oscar winning performance by Joe Pesci). From then on we as an audience grow up with Henry Hill and his ageing, his addiction to drugs, his time in prison and the meeting of his future wife. All of it portrayed as a ""glamorous"" lifestyle, or as a stick of dynamite with the fuse nearly out. During the 1970's, the gang commits the infamous Lufthansa Heist, and starts killing off other members from rival gangs to assure dominance. Bizarrely, they start offing their own as well to assert their power, will Henry survive?Well again, tops to Martin Scorsese. Truly the best man you could want behind the camera for this kind of genre. Every detail in the background is crisp, and the shadows in the corners of the frame have never looked so menacing and unsafe. Broad, dark and flashy, ""Goodfellas"" is a great film. Luckily for us Scorsese would revisit this kind of lifestyle a few years later in ""Casino"" (1995), but since then nothing has felt quite like this and I can't think of a 1990's gangster film that compliments the old tropes of the genre. As piles and piles of new-age British gangster movies appear, they all deal with nothing but sex, drugs, football and money. There are no values in these movies that come off legitimate anymore.Final Verdict: A landmark film to kick off the 1990's, ""Goodfellas"" is the kind of movie that just gets better with age. 9/10."
24568,True,"One of the greatest movies of all time. the acting, writing, music, and directing are all in top form here. For a movie that is nearly three hours, it just breezes by at a breakneck speed. this movie is truly a study of good directing and is one of the greatest gangster films ever made.this is truly Marty's masterpiece. this movie just oozes style and cool at every turn.definitely a must watch for any true movie lover. I wont spoil the story for anyone who has not seen it, but it is one wild ride, and it makes it all the more incredible when you realize that this is based on a true story. Robert deniro is he usual brilliant self, but the true star is the character ""Tommy"", portrayed by the excellent Joe pesci. his character is scary, insane, profane, and hilarious all at the same time, and he truly deserved the Oscar for best supporting actor in this film. he truly was the standout. in closing, I highly recommend this film for any fan of not only good mobster movies, but good films in general. it truly is a standout in every way, and it will not be a movie that will be easily forgotten."
24569,True,"(Spolier) Martin Scorsese's film ""Goodfellas,"" is an adaption of the book Wiseguy, written by Nicholas Pileggi. It may be one of the best gangster movies ever made. It is raw and gritty, unlike movies of the same genre like, ""The Untouchables"" or ""The Godfather"". Scorsese stayed true to the nature of what life is really like when you are a part of the mob.Throughout the film you see the inside dealings of the mob. These men hold nothing back. They will tell you how it is, and will whack anyone who is out of line and disrespectful. The life of the mob is about loyalty, respect, and proving you are worthy of this family. There are certain rules you have to abide by in order to work your way up and be ""made."" Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) represents this perfectly. He is quick to start a fight, or draw his gun if he feels that he is being disrespected. Later on in the film, his fate is realized when revenge is taken out on him. This movie is based on the actual events of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). In the first half of the movie, you are introduced to Henry, and how he became entangled with the mob. He always knew he was meant to be a part of this life. Being a gangster meant that you were a part of a family, and belonged to this elite group that would forever look out for you, as long as you remained true to them. A gangster is the embodiment of masculinity. You have money and women at your disposal and no one would ever mess with you, because you are a ""tough guy"". Who wouldn't want that?It's been said that too much of something can become problematic. The second half of the film you witness Henry's downfall. He leads a double life. He has a wife, Karen (Lorraine Bracco) and children at home, and girlfriends on the side. One girlfriend in particular, Sandy (Debi Mazar) helps him with his new business of dealing and selling cocaine. He was never satisfied. He knew that his involvement could compromise his relationships with Karen and with the mob, especially his boss Pauly Cicero (Paul Sorvino). This didn't stop him, he thought he could handle it. He was organized, after all that is what the mob is all about, organized crime. The music and the dialogue that was chosen, added authenticity to the film. The music was chosen based on the time period the scenes were set in. In Henry's earlier life you heard songs by Tony Bennet, and The Cleftones. In his later life you heard songs by The Rolling Stones and The Who. Music provided transitions between certain scenes, specifically, when Henry was a teenager and he walked out of the court room. He was met by all of the members of the mob cheering for him. He had learned a valuable lesson, you don't ever snitch and you keep your mouth shut. The frame freezes, music begins to play, and you have now jumped several years into 1963.The dialogue was what you would expect to hear from a mobster. Much of the great dialogue was discovered through rehearsals, where Scorsese let his actors roam free, then wrote into the script many of the lines they came up with (admin, 2013). The use of voice over narration was crucial to the tone of the film. Without it, the movie would not be what it is. It was essential for Henry to fill in the background information needed in order to understand what was happening in the story. If you want to get the best idea of what life is like as gangster in the mob, this the movie to watch. References admin. (2013, June 4). ScirptShadow Screen writing and Screenplay Reviews.

24570,True,"This is by far, the best movie I have ever seen! Every single bit of the movie was just outstanding! Joe Pesci won his Oscar for it most certainly defiantly deserved it! In fact all the main characters in the film should've at least been nominated for an Oscar, everyone was brilliant. But Martin Scorsese should've won the Oscar for best director, he did an amazing job! The screenplay was just right! Yes, I know it's very brutal and full of swear words, but that was how gangster life was like. Plus it had adult humor in which worked brilliantly! *SPOILER!* For example when Joe Pesci's character shoots a boy, everyone gets all cross with him and annoyed, and he said 'well it was a good shot'! That sort of dark humor just puts the cherry on the cake!"
24571,True,"Both watched the film and read the book and both are amazing. In terms of accuracy they're pretty terrific, there are a few differences but they're not significant. In real life Tommy was a huge, powerful man whilst Pesci in the film is diminutive but no less terrifying. Tommy wasn't shot in the face so his family couldn't have an open coffin as featured in the film, he just disappeared and was never seen again (which is exactly what happened to his girlfriend a short time later). The famous 'funny how?' story was not actually something which happened to Henry Hill but was something which really did happen to Joe Pesci whilst he was working as a waiter for some genuine Mafioso. Tremendous performances all around, De Niro his customary excellent, a career making turn from both Ray Liotta and Loraine Brocco and did you spot a then unknown Samuel L Jackson as Stacks? In many ways though it's Pesci who dominates, prior to this he was largely known as a comic actor with Home Alone and Lethal Weapon 2, such a small guy but just full of unbelievable aggressiveness, he makes you shudder. What I really like about it is that it shows you both the good side and the bad side of being a gangster. On the good side you are the 'movie-star with muscle' everything just falls into your lap and you live the life of Reilly, even when you go to prison you're treated special. On the bad side you have to do things like dig up the rotting corpses of other gangsters you've murdered and rebury them. Keep looking over your shoulder for the police and FBI all the time. And that your friends aren't really your friends, they'll happily rat you out if they think it'll save them or slit your throat if they think there's 5 bucks in it for them (""F*ck you, pay me!"") One thing I would suggest is that if you enjoyed this you should check out 'The Big Heist' with Donald Sutherland, a TV movie starring Donald Sutherland which concentrates on Jimmy Burke."
24572,True,"The greatest MOB film ever, just ahead of Godfather 1 and 2 IMO.De Niro, Pesci and especially Liota shine.This film contains perhaps my favourite scene ever where Robert De Niro does not say one word in the entire scene, he smokes and smiles and glares at a guy he is plotting to kill and the smile takes place when he looks at Pescii. That is acting he does not have to say one word.Scorcese is amazing with his direction. That scene Liotta takes his date Karen to the restaurant and they follow them from the back to the table is directing perfection.This film is based on the real story of Henry Hill.The Dialogue is again top notch.One of the best scripts ever.Some of the coolest characters to ever hit the screen.A great film all around, a masterpiece. Not many better.A top 5 movie ever in my honest opinion."
24573,True,"There are many films that I would highly rate when it comes to crime films. Pulp Fiction, Dark Knight, The Godfather and the Shawshank Redemption but in this list will always come Goodfellas. Goodfellas is not just a movie about gangsters. Its a movie that has heart and emotion as well as comedy, violence and pretty much everything else. Much of the film focuses on the inner self of our three main mobsters: Henry, Jimmy and Tommie. The film deeply explores the personalities of each character and shows us the friendship between these three criminals. This film does something ""Quentin Tarantino"" ish and that is something I found interesting for a Martin Scorsosse film and that is the link between the opening scene and a scene approximately half way during the movie. The film mainly focuses on Henry, our main character, as a boy at a young age who had admired and wanted to be a gangster like the family he idolised, the Luchhes'. I found each of the main characters fascinating, and as much as I liked the character story for Henry, I mainly enjoyed Joe Pesci's Oscar winning performance as Tommie. I often found myself laughing at Tommie. The casting for this film could not have been any better. Robert de Niro as Jimmy was brilliant, Ray Liatto as Henry was great and most of all Joe Pesci as Tommie was the best of the three.I liked the story very much which focuses on Henry as he mainly tries to become a gangster in order to also help out his family. I found the ending emotional and brilliantly done.Overall, fans of crime movies must check out Goodfellas. It'll hardly disappoint!"
24574,True,"The film is based on Wiseguys, the true story of Henry Hill's rise & fall in the Luchesse crime family during 1955-80.In 1950s Bronx, young Henry Hill admires gangsters who according to him live an ideal life.He quits school and joins the gang under Paulie (Paul Sorvino) , doing jobs like paying off people & collecting protection money. He meets Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) whose main work is hijacking cargo trucks. He learns the biggest rule of crime life from him - Never rat on your friends & always keep your mouth shut.In the 60s, the adult Henry(Ray Liotta) with Tommy Vito (Joe Pesci),a psychopathic gangster & Jimmy work to spread the gang's influence. Henry & the others hang around with numerous women in nightclubs in an intimidating manner .In 1967, Henry carries out the Air France robbery thereby making his entry into bigtime crime. He marries a Jewish girl Karen (Lorraine Bracco) who is seduced by his glamorous lifestyle. She accepts his crime life, mostly because it gives her an opulent living. In 1970 Tommy brutally beats Billy Batts (Frank Vincent) for insulting his poor origins, Jimmy too joining in. They are in trouble as Batts is a made man with the Gambinos. They bury him in the outskirts of the city, stopping midway to finish off the half alive Batts. Later they are forced to exhume and rebury the corpse elsewhere when they find out that the land due to a new construction project.Henry soon takes a mistress. Karen pulls a gun on him, he overpowers her and tells her that he has bigger worries than her, like getting killed on the street. Paulie meets him and orders him to return to her, and sends him with Jimmy to recover money from a defaulter. But the target's sister is a typist with FBI, she turns over the entire gang (her brother included) to the police. In order to make his ends meet, Henry resorts to drug running from jail.Upon release from prison in 1978,he continues his cocaine trading which he had started in jail, much to the disapproval of Paulie who sternly warns him to stop it immediately. He not only ignores this warning, but ropes in Jimmy and Tommy and various other people, including Karen, his daughters babysitter and a new drug addict girlfriend. The same year, Henry along with the crew, carries out the Lufthansa heist in JFK airport , which is the biggest hijacking of goods in US history.Some gang members start spending the proceeds from the heist immediately, buying expensive things that put them in the spotlight. Jimmy promptly has them murdered and later on,also has one by one all the other participants of the heist murdered, their corpses turning up in different parts of the city for months. Henry knows that Jimmy has all the cash from the heist, and he is merely eliminating the partners to have it all to himself, but cant do anything. One day, Tommy is lured by promises to make him a made man and killed, by his own gang members as a revenge for the murder of Billy Batts in order to make peace with the Gambinos.By 1980, Henry is a cocaine addicted wreck, sustaining himself solely by drug running, due to which he has alienated Paulie and the others. He is on the constant surveillance of the FBI , who finally tail him an entire and arrest him. During his absence, his house is also raided, and Karen in order to evade arrest and conviction flushes down the entire cocaine stash, thereby rendering themselves virtually penniless.Jimmy goes to Paulie for help, who being angry with him due to his drug operations, pays him $3200 and ends all association with him.He gets a final shock when he realizes that Jimmy intends to have him killed, by setting him up in a hit, in order to erase the last link between him and the Lufthansa heist.With no other way to save himself and his family, Henry agrees to become an FBI informant under the witness protection plan. As a result of his collaboration and his testimony, Paulie, Jimmy and all the major members of the gang are arrested and sentenced to long terms in prison without parole. Henry himself gets a sentence which is further reduced due to his collaboration.The last shot of the film shows a very vulnerable looking Henry Hill ,now divorced, who in a final voice over says that the good times are over and that he is penniless just like the average working people that he used to ridicule .The closing credits show his fate and that of all the others in the gang, being put away for life.Scorsese maintains a good pace, with a crisp background narration. Gangsters are shown as what they are, vermin beneath the shining suits . It perfectly shows that crime never pays giving the message subtly, sans preaching or moral dialogues, instead leaving the viewer to figure it out as the film goes along.Ray Liotta plays Henry efficiently, right from the background narration to his transition from a brash gangster to a sorry shadow of his former self. Lorraine Bracco is fine as Karen. Robert DeNiro very beautifully portrays the cunning & vicious Jimmy Conway ,a friend one instant and a killer the next, his screen time is shorter than usual but just as effective. But the show stealer is Joe Pesci as the psychopathic Tommy Vito who is crazy & vicious at the same time, as the one who intimidates Henry or the one who calmly shoots a waiter for being late in serving him.Oscars snubbed this great work and only Joe Pesci got his due. But it rightly was a commercial & critical success and will always remain a favourite for any avid film viewer."
24575,True,"The mob is not all glitz and glamor. As you see in the movie. But also in the movie, you see that it is also violent and taboo. People will kill others in order to rise through the ranks. And that we learn about mob life that nobody is immune from violence. Not even the mobster's wives and children.Martin Scorsese after ""Raging Bull"" had a ""quiet"" 1980s as he revived his career with this mob classic. Playing to perfection despite the rough violence and language.Ray Liotta only in his fourth movie at the time, after ""Field of Dreams"" plays the protagonist, the now departed Henry Hill who rose from the lower ranks of the mob family in lower Brooklyn in the 1950s as a teenager gofer.But due to being Irish, you can't be a made man in the mob as being a ""Goodfella"" you have to be 100% Italian and have it traced back to the country. A made man means you could not be touched unless it was a ""just cause."" But still Hill manages to be lured by the glamorous lifestyle of mob life.Due to mob leader Paulie Cierco(Paul Sorvino) a leader of a few words but a dangerous one and Jimmy ""the Gent"" Conway, his mentor whom you should not get on his bad side(Robert De Niro). Both lead and guide Henry while the young man encounters both glamor and danger at the same time.Last but not least, Tommy Devito(Oscar-winner Joe Pesci), as he is really trigger happy and has a awful temper and says lots of foul language. But only time you will see him nice is with his mom(played by the director's late mom, Catherine.Hill also is something of a womanizer before and during his marriage to Karen, a Jewish woman(played by the ""Sopranos"" Lorraine Bracco). And has two daughters. At first Karen is suspicious of the mobster lifestyle but then really enjoys the perks and privileges.But also during prison, that does not stop Henry and the others from murder, stealing, and unbeknowest to the other mobsters except for Paulie, who warns him, and Jimmy, Henry starts to deal with drugs.And the last day he is a gangster proves nerve wrecking for Henry. While trying to avoid the FBI and doing so much. In his drug dealing ways catch up to him. Will the mob make him pay? Great script and really a great acting. And directing as it is a Scorsese classic. Liotta should had been a household name but bad picks caused him to not let him do that. Still he is great as Hill.Same with Bracco as she revived her career with ""The Sopranos."" Joe Pesci is really the scene stealing. You love to hate him but still, no wonder he walked away with the award, De Niro is great. He gives way to Liotta. Sorvino is really not saying much but does not have to.A huge classic if you can tolerate the language and violence!"
24576,True,"The first time I saw this movie, I wasn't quite sure if I liked it or not. The more I watched it, though, the more I liked it. The violence in this film is pretty extreme, but accurate, as are the characters.This film stands out in the Gangster genre, because there isn't a ""good guy,"" and the bad guy (who is the protagonist) doesn't die. Though, a lot of them do.I think the language could have been toned down a bit. I know that's how these guys talk, but this film could have been just as good without it, and their audience would be wider. It's an important film to see, so that would be a plus.The ""Layla"" montage is one of my favorite in any movie ever, and it's the perfect blend of cinematic beauty and dark/disturbing/creepy.Overall I recommend this film, particularly if you like gangster or crime movies. It's historically accurate (pretty much), and has some memorable stuff. ""You dink I'm funny?!"""
24577,True,"Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino star in Martin Scorsese's 1990 crime drama based on the book, ""Wiseguy."" This story reflects on Henry Hill (Liotta) who becomes part of the mob world and eventually turns against it. It also tells about his troubled marriage with wife, Karen Hill (Bracco). He starts out as a small-time crook and makes his way as a gangster falling into the dangerous world of crime, drugs and violence. De Niro (Raging Bull) plays Jimmy Conway, Pesci (Home Alone) plays Tommy DeVito, Sorvino (A Fine Mess) plays Paul Cicero and Scorsese's parents, Charles and Catherine also appear. This is a terrific film with a great cast that's definitely one of Scorsese's best I recommend."
24578,True,"Goodfellas is one of those films where every choice is perfect. The directing, the writing, the acting, the music, all brilliant and completely immerses you in the violent yet alluring world Scorsese has created. Even as you watch these people do horrible things and pay dearly in the end for their actions, you still kind of leave thinking ""Being a gangster seems pretty sweet."" One of the ways the film tricks you is by making these characters likable. Henry is charming, Tommy is funny (although don't call him that!), Jimmy is everyone's big brother. I think having charismatic leads really sucks you in, justifying their despicable behavior. One of the lies they all feed each other throughout the film is that the life is about family but it is really about men serving themselves as they see fit. You want something, take it. Someone gets in your way, kill them. http://amandalovesmovies.com/2012/02/17/goodfellas/ ‎"
24579,True,"Goodfellas follows the exploits of Henry Hill and his friends as they strive to gain power in the mob in the middle of the 20th century. Hill gets involved in arson, robbery, hijacking and even murder with his pals Jimmy Conway and Tommy DeVito. Ambition and power comes a great cost to Hill and his family however, as he descends into world of addiction, paranoia and in the end, he betrays the two rules he was taught years previously, never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut...Since its release in 1990, Goodfellas has become a landmark in the crime genre and a significant picture in the recent history of cinema, and rightly so. Few crimes, like The Godfather, effectively convey the importance of family like Goodfellas does. The film features sterling performances from Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro as always. Scorsese is known for his effective use of score and it is perhaps at its peak here. Songs from The Rolling Stones, Derek and the Dominoes and George Harrison bring the period to life and set the tone for the film perfectly. Scorsese's direction must also be praised, a trademark in the long tracking shot resurfaces in a scene which follows Henry and Karen into a restaurant, through the corridors, through the kitchen and to their seat in a shot that lasts a good minute and a half at least.Goodfellas is one of those movies that towers above modern cinema with its realistic and brutal view of life in the mob, its sympathetic characters and it stands as one of the finest reasons for why Martin Scorsese may be the greatest and most influential director alive, if not in the whole of cinema history."
24580,True,"When I first heard of Goodfellas, I was intrigued. It wasn't about a a single part of a gangster's life, it wasn't about the one part where the gangster decided to move along, it wasn't all that sappy, stupid stuff. It was about the LIFE of a gangster, and that meant realism..Realism is a change sometimes, because it's either overused or underused. People make it so hyper-realistic, it may be a bit boring. On the latter, they use so many things to make it unrealistic that it doesn't even make sense to watch it. But realism works as a counterpart, and it was a film by Martin Scorsese. Who could go wrong with that?I turned it on, watched it, and enjoyed it. It worked as a gangster movie, but anything outside of that? I had some mixed feelings...The acting was brilliant. Everything did such an amazing job, I was surprised at how good it was. Especially how I've heard some scenes were acted how by REAL gangsters. And some scenes weren't told to the background actors, so their reactions were real and surprised.. The screenplay was really well-done. The jokes weren't supposed to be laugh- out-loud funny, but the actors played their parts and perfected them. Their sarcastic behavior made it THIS much more enjoyable and I had a grin upon my face the entire time.. The thing that made this the best was how the whole film reflected of the entire life of a gangster, and how things go in between. Instead of believing I was just watching a movie, I believed I was watching the unfolding of a gangster's life. We have the start, the life of them, the ups and downs, and how everything just goes downhill. We go on an array of emotions and much more. Classic.. But there seemed to be a problem with all of this. Although the movie broke-ground for future movies, there seemed to be this blandness to it. I don't know what it was. I loved the movie as a whole, but looking as I hadn't seen it when it became a classic, it seemed a bit contrived maybe? It seems sad to say that because I wanted to like it more than I had. But something seemed wrong. Something seemed not Scorsese about it... Bad things stop there. The movie really was great, and I really do recommend watching it. But as it receives such high praise, maybe I had too much expectation(s) to surpass the un-originality the film gave to me. But the film was good, no doubt about it.7/10."
24581,True,"There is truly no other word to describe this masterful work of art. You can't even describe it as ""a great film."" It transcends that phrase, which can be interpreted very differently by different people, to the phrase, ""one of the best movies ever made."" Everything from the acting to the music was absolutely perfect. Joe Pesci is the pitch perfect gangster, and Robert DeNiro doesn't even need mentioning as one of the best mafioso characters of all time. Every scene makes you feel, wonder, writhe, squirm, laugh, cry, and dream all at the same time. It shows a side of the mafia never before seen on the big screen: the fun- loving, rich, godly characters that really ruled the streets of New York City. What makes this film different from films like The Godfather is that The Godfather is made to make you understand what the mafia is. I'm not denying the awesomeness of The Godfather, but I'm saying it's darker and more serious. Meanwhile, Goodfellas makes you feel so many different emotions, from abject terror to hilarity. And Goodfellas is much more analytical than The Godfather (in my honest opinion). When Martin Scorsese does something, he does it for an honest reason. Francis Ford Coppola isn't random, but Martin Scorsese, in my opinion, does it better. From the hilarious and touching beginning to the dark and depressing ending, Goodfellas is one of the best mafia movies of all time, and one of the best films of all time in general. Go see Goodfellas. By the way, for those of you that have seen Goodfellas, ""You're a funny guy."""
24582,True,"As a huge fan of Scorsese's 2000s movies Goodfellas seemed right up my alley. Indeed, the measure of greatness of Scorsese movies is how they stack up against this classic and the question is often what is his best since.So my expectations were high to say the least. There are some scenes in Goodfellas which would make me proud to have it included in my list of top movies - from intimidating the mailman by shoving his head in the oven to Tommy's reckless blasting away of ""Spider"" over a trifle, to Henry Hill waking up to his wife pointing a gun in his face, and, my favourite scene, when Tommy is shot dead and blood flows slowly from his head out over the floor.And I could go on listing scenes. This is exactly the point - there is something lacking, even poor, in the story as a whole i.e. in the pace of the film. Henry following Tommy along to the double date is a turning point in the narrative, with Karen coming into the story at this point. The initial scene at the restaurant just seems to fit in as another part of the lengthy orientation. Then the two have an argument on the street - again it all seems to fit in. Then all of a sudden Henry's voice-over tells us that he finds her attractive and Karen's opinion somehow changes and they decide they'll go out, this time on a proper date - this is way too unrealistic. The awkwardness of the first date is conveyed so well, with the contrast between Tommy and his girl, and the voice-over from Karen, that it's fair to wonder why she even wanted to go on the second date. After the Copacabana date you can believe that she was impressed with him but I'm sure most people found it odd that she wasn't repelled to begin with and got caught up in the whole thing. It takes ages for anything narratively significant to happen, and when it does it's out of nowhere.The film seems to be confused what its emphasis is. The opening scene is taken out from a late point in the movie, giving it that mystery-movie style revelation when we realise the context of that scene. This is inappropriate - by the time we figure out what that scene was about we know that the gangsters kill people all the time, and sometimes over practically nothing, especially Tommy. There's too much of a similarity between the murders of Spider and Billy Batts to give special importance to Batts; sure, Spider was a nobody and Batts was a ""made"" man, but there should have been more done to show why Batts was more serious. The filmmakers couldn't have expected audiences to grasp the intenseness of killing a made man. Goodfellas isn't a movie about the Lufthansa heist, not really. The filmmakers obviously chose to sacrifice a traditional story for an in depth, more holistic view of mob life. The cost is that the climax lacks some depth. The filmmakers were never interested in the heist, they were interested in its aftermath, because that's where the characters interrelate. All those involved are slowly killed off by Jimmy Conway, and in the sense that we finally see the fullness of Jimmy's gangster quality (besides throwing 100s to operating doormen and bartenders) there is some interest and drama. But this is compromised because the heist is an opportunity that the gangsters merely stumble upon - there is no reason or meaning involved in the actual robbery besides their normal greed. Jimmy Conway has nothing personal in it, no journey towards it, and it is this extra psychological depth that would have made the ending truly masterful. The filmmakers, and hence the audience, are too caught up in the characters' relations to think about them individually.A lot will disagree with this, but I think The Departed is better. It has all the same great hallmarks of directing but it has a masterfully crafted story that isn't spontaneous and doesn't drag (even though The Departed is longer) and it is psychologically deep (the main female character is a psychologist, what more could you want?). This said, Goodfellas is a quality movie and a proud part of the Scorsese canon, and if a friend came and told me he recently watched it I would still light up and be ready to talk about all the amazing scenes.In short, to be a Masterpiece, EVERYTHING has to go right - and although there are lots of awesome films there are few masterpieces, and Goodfellas is definitely an example of the former and not the latter."
24583,True,"Martin Scorsese's black comic Mafia case history claims to be a true story, but the facts are less important than the exaggerated, hyper-kinetic style in which they're presented. In just over two hours the film covers more than thirty years in the career of model criminal Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), from his childhood rise to privilege to his inevitable downfall through drugs, and finally to the ultimate treachery of his testimony under the FBI witness protection program. With so little time to cover so much ground the film, by necessity, moves like greased lightning (Liotta's constant voice-over narration is almost like having the entire source book, 'Wiseguys', read aloud), and although a certain depth is lost in the process the density of detail is amazing.Scorsese admitted he wanted to structure his Mafia epic like a two-hour coming attractions trailer, and that's a fair description of the finished film: there's no actual dialogue in the first thirty minutes, no real conflict for a least an hour, and no suggestion of a plot until the film is two-thirds over. What emerges instead is a visually dense and hyperactive stew of details, incidents, and non-stop music references, often suggesting an insider's guide to New York City Italian-American culture. The technique is often as violent as the subject (even with the gallows humor provided by comic psychopath Joe Pesci) and, while the director certainly deserves all the acclaim the film has earned him, equal credit for helping build such incredible kinetic energy belongs to his longtime collaborators Michael Ballhaus (cinematography) and Thelma Schoonmaker (editing), especially in the latter half of the film, when Liotta's cocaine habit starts getting out of hand.Scorsese might be criticized for elevating style over substance; his film doesn't really say anything except ""crime doesn't pay"" (not exactly a revelation), but says it with a thrilling, kick-in-the-pants vitality, succeeding in putting a unique spin on a genre many people might be excused for thinking had long been exhausted."
24584,True,"This is one of the very best movies you will ever see. It is true art. Martin Scorcese did a masterful job with the directing, music, editing. The acting is superb, maybe the best I've seen. The stars, Deniro, Pesci, Liotta, Bracco, and Sorvino were all brilliant. One of the best scripts ever. The dialogue seems more realistic and natural than in any other movie. The story's great. The characters themselves, Jimmy Conway, Tommy DeVito and Henry Hill are absolutely fascinating. The way this films allows us to delve into these mobsters lives is a true experience, and it is all brought to life by Scorcese. Probably the best direction I've seen in a film. Every scene is so perfectly crafted. The pace of the film seems flawless, it completely grasps hold of you from start to finish. Goodfellas is presented on screen in a way that no film rivals. It is so true to call it the most uncompromising movie ever, it's completely original. Goodfellas is the 2nd best movie I've ever seen, better than Godfather and all that. If I had to pick one movie to watch for the rest of my life, it would no doubt be Goodfellas.""Whoa! Can't believe what I just heard. Hey Spider, here. This is for you."" ""I'm gonna go get the papers, get the papers."""
24585,True,"It's as if Scorsese peeked into their lives. Eavesdropped on every conversation they had. Took note of every little thing. Otherwise how can one justify this movie that provides the closest look EVER into the lives of mob soldiers? By focusing on a group of small-time street guys - hijackers of booze, cigarettes and what-not, and narrating their story, Scorsese paints a larger picture. It is essentially this approach, this perspective from the bottom rung of the ladder that reveals to us like never before the inner workings of the mob, its rules, its values (or lack of them). The result is a threadbare exposé of mob life, a horrifying tale of greed and violence. The result is ""Goodfellas"".""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster""  reminisces Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), an aspiring Irish-Italian hood who will never be ""made"" and allowed into the family, who will always have to scrounge for existence at the fringes of power. With his mentor Jimmy ""the gent"" Conway(De Niro) and a gun-wielding, short-fused psychopath Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) by his side, Hill lives his dream. He earns money for himself and for the family, but stays inside the line, because, if ""you get out of line, you get whacked"". Then the Lufthansa Heist comes along, and little by little, things start to go haywire. Fidelity among fellow gangsters evaporates only to leave the slime of violent greed. And in the end, ironically, Hill must get out of line in order to save himself from the very people he idolized. He must rat out.The screenplay by Scorsese and Pileggi remains faithful to the original book and is a-w-e-s-o-m-e. No one will feel the absence of Paul Schrader here. But it takes the brilliance of Scorsese to take those words and turn them into unforgettable scenes on the celluloid. Take, for example, the scene when Henry takes Karen to the Copa through a back-door. The whole scene from the car to the Copa stage is filmed in a single shot, with a steadicam following Henry and Karen as they move through winding hallways and kitchen. The technical complexity of the shot is matched only by its extraordinary vision. Through this single shot Karen, virtually a stranger to Henry's way of life gets a taste of what power can be, of how seductive and intoxicating it can be. Scorsese redefines cinematic language in this film. The piano coda in ""Layla"" or Donovan's ""Atlantis"" will never be the same for someone after they've seen ""Goodfellas"". Yes, it's THAT powerful.I've often wondered how this film is complementary to ""The Godfather"". While ""Goodfellas"" discerns mob life through the eyes of a lower-strata soldier, ""The Godfather"" deals with the upper echelons of the mafia syndicate. But they meet somewhere. From the bribing of senators in ""The Godfather"" to the bribing of prison guards in ""Goodfellas"", from the wiping out of the heads of the crime families in ""The Godfather"" to the gangland executions of mob enforcers in ""Goodfellas"" they meet somewhere. The actions, the emotions, the motives  they all meet somewhere. They meet and create the whole picture. A picture that is brutal, but true nonetheless.We were waiting for the other half of that picture since 1972. Our wait ended with ""Goodfellas""."
24586,True,"""Raging Bull"" director Martin Scorsese received his third Oscar nomination as Best Director for ""Goodfellas,"" starring Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci, an engrossing epic about life in the mafia based on Nicholas Pileggi's bestselling biography about real-life gangster Henry Hill. This blue collar crime saga differs from mafia melodramas like Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" because Scorsese refrains from either eavesdropping on the upper echelons of organized crime management or depicting the actual logistics involved in its major heist. In other words, scenes concerning the hierarchy of mob bosses convening to resolve rivalries among their families or scenes about the actual heist are never shown. Nevertheless, ""Goodfellas"" is violent, profane, and unrelenting in its R-rated portrayal of crime and punishment. Pesci won the Best Supporting Actor's Oscar, while ""Goodfellas"" received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Film Editing, and Best Screenplay based on material adapted from another medium. Incidentally, Kevin Costner's ""Dances with Wolves"" trumped ""Goodfellas"" for the Oscar.Essentially, Scorsese's film traces the rise and fall of Brooklyn-born, Irish/Sicilian American Henry Hill from working as a teenager at a mafia cab stand to his adult exploits as a full-fledged mafia soldier. Scorsese glamorizes Hill's life during the first hour as a crook, and the young Hill wins sympathy as an underdog. Everything turns to sour in the second hour, however, as the mutt mutates into a murderer. After several years of getting away with his crimes, our protagonist winds up in prison, gets paroled, resorts to selling cocaine, finds himself at odds with his own mafia types before he decides to participate in the Justice Department's Witness Protection Program. Incidentally, the title ""Goodfellas"" refers to the mafia concept that when an individual works for the mob then he becomes one of mob. In other words, the family that slays and steals together stays together. The opening scene in ""Goodfellas"" sets the tone for this grim film. Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro of ""Raging Bull""), Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci of ""Lethal Weapon 2"") and Henry (Ray Liotta of ""Article 99"") are cruising down the highway at night when Henry gets curious about a noise that sounds suspiciously like their sedan has had a flat tire. After Henry pulls the car over, Jimmy and Tommy inspect the trunk where they have stashed the bloody body of a man swathed with sheets. Tommy stabs the man repeatedly and Jimmy blasts at the man with his revolver. The camera pushes in on Henry watching Jimmy and Tommy kill the man sprawled helplessly in the trunk and then we hear Henry utter in a voice-over, ""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster."" Intermittently, the Liotta character addresses the audience, furnishing important information about the mafia milieu, until the last few minutes when the protagonist breaks the fourth wall and addresses the audience. ""Goodfellas"" qualifies as a slam-bang crime thriller. This is not a film about set-pieces like you see in Coppola's ""Godfather"" movies or Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon A Time in America."" Scorsese infiltrates the audience into the mafia and shares many of the mob's secrets that have become familiar with film-going audiences in a way that seems fresh and off-the-cuff. Initially, we sympathize with young Henry (newcomer Christopher Serrone) who takes a job at Tuddy Cicero's cab stand running errands for the gangsters in the neighborhood. Before long Henry is earning more money than his hot-tempered father, and he loves the respect that the mobsters lavish on him. Tuddy (Frank DeLio of ""Kiss of Death"") lets him park Cadillacs, sell contraband items, smash car windows and play fire-bug. Unlike his working class Irish father who takes a belt to him when he discovers that his son has quit attending school, the mobsters are more of a family to Henry than his own kin. As an adult, Henry becomes fast friends with Jimmy, who Henry assures us is ""one of the most feared guy in the city"" and pint-sized Tommy who isn't afraid of anybody. This insider's look at the mafia follows these three mafiateers as they steal, rob, lie, cheat, and kill their way to the a fortune. When Tommy cannot convince a girl to go out on a date with unless he finds a suitable fellow for her friend, Tommy twists Henry's reluctant arm. Henry meets Karen (Lorraine Bracco, later of HBO's ""The Sopranos"") who becomes his wife. There is one scene when Henry escorts Karen to a popular nightclub that dazzles her because everybody showers them with respect and praise. Although she doesn't know exactly how Henry makes his living, Henry tells her that he works for the union in the construction business. No sooner does Henry marry Karen and have kids than he starts cheating on her with whores that he sets up in nearby houses and Karen initially believes him when he cannot come home for business reasons. One morning Henry awakens to Karen straddling him in bed with a snub-nosed revolver aimed between his eyes. This is a chilling scene. It is a testament to Scorsese's skill as co-writer and director that the repugnant world of crime looks so compelling. Jimmy and Tommy are brutal, unrepentant thugs. A life of crime turns Henry into a cold, calculating operator who enjoys all the advantages of mob living. Like a movie made during the Production Code era (1934-1968) that dictated that crime should not pay, our protagonist gets his comeuppance. Nevertheless, Scorsese shows his sense of humor in one scene when Tommy, Jimmy, and Henry awaken Tommy's mother at his house and she insists on cooking a meal for them. Scorsese never lets the momentum of ""Goodfellas"" slacken and this crime drama boasts enough surprises to keep audiences on their toes. Altogether, ""Goodfellas"" rates as one of the top ten mob movies and its soundtrack of nostalgic tunes doesn't hurt it."
24587,True,"Goodfellas isn't your average gangster movie for starters, instead Goodfellas wander's into film history and will be remembered as one of the finest film's ever created. Scorsese has stepped back into his gangster stepping shoe's and has devised a movie so perfectly acted, directed and classy that it'l be a hard decision to name the best gangster movie ever amounted. For Scorsese, this was a simple task and one which he had visited before (Mean Streets), and so was familiar with the history of the period and the style e.t.c.Scorsese excels in the technical aspect in Goodfellas. Wheather it be using flash cuts, freeze frames, crash zooms or montages, Scorsese has it all there and put's it to brilliant use. De Niro is excellent as is Ray Liotta and not forgetting Joe Pesci who suits his character effortlessly."
24588,True,"What crime lord is going to have a wedding so out in the open that the press of cops could show up? No putting Godfather 1& 2 down (Now #3 is a whole other story) but based on documentaries I've seen Goodfellas better captures the feel of the Mafia world. From Paul Sorvino's Don on down the group introduced to us plays down their money. Godfather's characters just don't. Sorcesse (sp) does not attempt to an effort to glamorize these characters or make their image appealing. What kept me glued was second the moral descent of Karen; it was like watching a close friend or relative ignoring warnings and making big and bigger mistakes to keep the poison relationship going. And main reason, there's Joe Pesci; I was happy to find out he won an Oscar. Funniest Creepiest movie gangster in any movie I've seen."
24589,True,"""Goodfellas"" cannot be described in a single word. ""Funny,"" ""dramatic,"" ""violent,"" ""nostalgic,"" and ""emotional"" are all terms which apply to the film, but none begin to do justice to this phenomenal piece. Martin Scorsese combines the fascinating true story of Henry Hill with great acting, witty humor, and believable representations of time and place. The film is set primarily in New York City from the 1950s to the 80s. Between locations, clothing, cars, music, and every other aspect of mise en scene, the time periods depicted in the film feel real. Scorsese grew up in New York in the 50s, and has known the city well throughout his life. He is able to give it life. He may not have direct experience with the mafia, but he is able to represent with great effect the real accounts given by Henry Hill. From the beginning of the film when a thirteen-year-old Hank got a job at the mob-run cabstand across the street to the courtroom almost thirty years later in which he sold out his longtime friends and associates out of fear of death, the criminal way of life is nothing short of authentic.A vital part of this authenticity comes from the fine performance of the entire cast. Ray Liotta's narration gives us a glimpse of his true feelings. Joe Pesci immortalizes Tommy as a psychotic character who, despite his short fuse, holds a place in the hearts of Henry and Jimmy. Robert De Niro gives one of the most unforgettable appearances of his stellar career as Jimmy Conway. Even smaller supporting roles, such as Paul Sorvino as Paulie, bring us into this world and keep us there.After nearly two decades, ""Goodfellas"" remains an exemplary example of a crime drama. The distinction of this unique take, blending the passion of ""The Godfather"" with the lightheartedness of ""Fargo,"" cannot be denied. It is the quintessential mob movie."
24590,True,"I finally saw this movie and it still has a little bit of a spell on me. I can't really compare ""Goodfellas"" to ""The Godfather"" because they're two totally different films. Goodfellas is shown and told through Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) whose only dream was to be a wise guy. The movie follows his journey from starting out as a youth who ran errands to the mob, to being one of the mob's closest members, and his eventual downfall.To cover many of the details in the film, there's much voice-over narration. In many movies, I find that a lot of narration is irritating and at times makes me loose interest in a film since I like to be shown what the film is about, not told. But the narration is a definite exception to this movie because it not only reveals the film as a past event, but also gets into the thoughts and feelings of the main character Henry. His girlfriend Karen (Lorraine Bracco), who later becomes his wife, also has her share of voice-over. An essential part to the film is both of their narration since it not only reveals their thoughts in a given scene, but it also develops a strong bond between the two, which later spirals.Scorsese's direction (who I think can relate a lot to the film, as person who grew up in New York City) is a key driving force in the film. There are many excellent shots in it that I could probably write a book on them. The one that stands out the most for me is in a scene where Henry takes Karen on a date. The camera follows them from the car, past a line of people at the entrance, down a flight of stairs, through a kitchen, and into the restaurant where a few waiters set up a table for them to be in the front of the floor show. This is the power of the mob, but everything that has a beginning has an end. I won't give the end of the film away, but the main man Ray goes from a real somebody to a nobody, which plays in the irony of the film. He gets it all, but then loses it.Another main ingredient in this film is Thelma Schoonmaker's editing. I have come to call her the greatest film editor of all time, and her work of freeze framing scenes, as well as clean cuts in between scenes are priceless. When it comes to the acting, all are great, but Joe Pesci is the real master. I recognize him mostly for being in the Lethal Weapons and Home Alones, but his skills are put to the test in this film as the likable, yet psychotic Tommy. His Oscar was well-deserved (the academy got it right for once).""Goodfellas"" though is not a movie for everyone. There's a lot of language (mostly said by Pesci) and some strong bloody violence that may shock and disturb viewers. Other than that, ""Goodfellas"" is definitely one of the greatest gangsters films ever made as well as one of Scorsese's best!"
24591,True,"Not only is this movie a masterpiece in cinema history and quite possibly the most charming and honest mob movie of all time BUT it also checks all the boxes for cinematic brilliance.Firstly, the cinematography is outstanding due to the unbeatable combination of Micheal Ballhaus and Scorsese's guiding hand that also helped shape another one of my favourite titles, The Departed. Both movies showed great camera work and a certain flare for the unique angle or unorthodox composition. The acting is also superb with Joe Pesci delivering his boldest performance to date. He plays the role of an insecure sociopath with an unexpected charm (although he took on a similar character profile in Casino).However the story absolutely steals the show with a captivating account of the rise and fall of small time gangster Henry Hill, in a manner only Scorsese could perfect. Admittedly I am a huge fan of the Rise and Fall (especially the fall) but this movie will intrigue and demand your full devotion to each character. The soundtrack embeds every vital moment in the movie to your memory with a classic song that subtly dictates the tone of the scene and strongly sets the atmosphere for the time period which spans over three decades. Watching a ""hit"" being performed by a stone cold gangster, shadowed by a soft love song in the background, can dramatically effect the way you feel about the killer.However, an unmistakable achievement of this movie is it's ability to tell the truth unlike other famous titles such as The Godfather which shamelessly romanticises the outcome of a life on the wrong side of the law. The film never fails to engage the viewer all throughout and follows an underlying tale of how the morality of even the organised crime sector of society has its black and white patches,as well a very large grey area.In all, Goodfellas is the benchmark of mob movies but also an all time great in movie history for its pure cinematic brilliance."
24592,True,"GOODFELLAS came out in the first year of the 90s and was so good it stayed one of the best films by the end of the decade. It is a supremely confident Martin Scorsese at his storytelling best! It is perhaps his last true masterpiece (so far). GOODFELLAS is the anti-gangster film. The anti-GODFATHER, GOODFELLAS tells the sordid, sleazy side of the gangster. It is realistic in presentation, but still has that Scorcese touch of flair and the characters jump out at the screen at you.GOODFELLAS is the story of one Henry Hill (played memorably by Ray Liotta, who also narrates most of the film). Henry was raised in Brooklyn in the 50s and ended up friends with a local hood Tommy DeVito, who was connected to the mob. As an adult Tommy is played by Joe Pesci in a performance that deservedly won him the Best Supporting Actor award of 1990. Pesci's speech was short but memorable (the Academy really deserves few words of thanks from anyone, but this time, they got the winner right). Tommy is a borderline psychopath who snaps at the slightest hint of disrespect towards him. These moments are simultaneously hilarious and frightening to watch, because they seem so real and Pesci perfectly relays the hotheadedness of Tommy.Tommy works for the larger mob, run by Paulie Cicero (a well cast Paul Sorvino in fine form). The go-to guy though for both Henry and Tommy is Paulie's right hand man Jimmy Conway (played by the great Robert DeNiro in one of his most underrated performances). DeNiro really carries GOODFELLAS for me. Scorcese ALWAYS seems to bring out the best in DeNiro. He really seems to know what makes this actor tick. And it works to perfection in GOODFELLAS.Together, the triumvirate of Henry, Tommy, and Jimmy successfully gangster-ize their way through the 50s, 60s, and 70s (well, 2 of them made it that far!). The convos in GOODFELLAS are what really strike me. They seem so authentic and scary. These guys plot, scheme, cajole, and kill with such alarming ease that it is almost a revelation that guys like this really existed. They are completely embedded in this world. They love being GOODFELLAS.Also memorable is Best Supporting Actress nominee Lorraine Bracco as Henry's wife Karen, who gets narrate a small part of the film herself. Initially disgusted by Henry and his world, Karen becomes intoxicated by it and caught in it herself. The biggest star of GOODFELLAS is probably the cinematography: long tracking shots, character closeups at key moments, zoom-ins to characters at important points, slightly shaky camera action, etc. It magnifies the effect of this deadly life that these people have chosen to be a part of. The use of era music is done to great effect as well, in addition to capturing the essence of the 50s through the 70s. Great work all around.GOODFELLAS was nominated for Best Picture in 1990 and should have won. Scorsese absolutely should have won Best Director. A real modern classic. Heck, a classic in any time period!"
24593,True,"Martin Scorsese collaborated with Nicholas Pileggi on this 1990 adaptation of Wiseguy, Pileggi's nonfiction book about gangsters in Brooklyn, and in terms of narrative fluidity it may well be the most accomplished thing Scorsese's ever done. Set between the mid-50s and the mid-80s, the semi-fictionalized story centers on a half-Irish, half-Sicilian Mafia recruit (Ray Liotta)--who narrates along with the Jewish woman (Lorraine Bracco) he eventually marries--and the other gangsters in his immediate circle (Joe Pesci, Robert De Niro, and Paul Sorvino). Paradoxically, the violent, amoral world the film depicts may be the darkest Scorsese has ever shown, but the surface mood is lighter than any Scorsese film since Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.De Niro performance is brilliant as a charming paranoid mobster and Joe Pesci's unforgettable.People think Goodfellas is similar to the Godfather but this focuses more on the blue collar side of the mob.Instant classic."
24594,True,"'Goodfellas' could be described as ""'The Godfather' on speed,"" but that wouldn't really be accurate. The two movies are very different. The mobsters in 'Godfather' are dignified by comparison. Those in 'Goodfellas' have practically been driven mad by power, money, and eventually, dope. At least one of them, Joe Pesci's Tommy, is quite literally insane. The film moves at a lightning pace, narration provided by the character Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco.) We see what takes places through Henry's (and to lesser degree, Karen's) descriptions, though it plays out right in front of us as well. Robert De Niro plays Jimmy, a charismatic gangster who is part of the mob but also something of a free agent; he can never be 'made' (the ultimate distinction the crime family can bestow on a member) because of his Irish roots. The same goes for Henry. He earns his place in the mob by starting at an early age as an errand boy willing to do anything, which endears him to the mob and their boss, Paulie. The violence in 'Goodfellas' is all the more appalling because for the most part, it is so casually administered. Tommy, for example, will kill anyone for the slightest perceived insult, with no more thought or regret than he would have ordering a drink. People are routinely beaten up savagely if they get crossways with any of the mob figures. But there is much more to the film than that, and I should point out there's a great deal of humor in the film, some of it laugh-out-loud funny. At times, it's like the most twisted comedy you've ever seen. 'Goodfellas' also shows how this 'community' of criminals and their families live; it takes place in and around New York City for the most part. Not surprisingly, it is a very tightly-knit group. Once Karen marries Henry, she has no contacts or life outside the extended 'family.' All of her female friends are wives of other mobsters. Birthdays, weddings, holidays... these are only shared with family insiders. This quirky little subculture has its own rules, standards and perks. For instance, there is one night a week designated for the men to take their mistresses out for drinks at a nightclub. Serving a prison term is accepted with a shrug; it seems almost all the men have served time at one point or another. Henry's first prison stint gets him congratulations from the others. It's like a badge of honor or a rite of passage. The lifestyle is very fast-paced, almost maniacally so. Everyone the mobsters deal with is paid off with wads of cash: cops, delivery boys, waiters, prison guards, you name it. Every gangster in the family carries with him a roll of hundreds (occasionally twenties); I've never seen so much currency exchange hands so frequently as in 'Goodfellas.' Eventually, despite Paulie's prohibition against it, several of the men including Henry begin dealing in drugs, specifically cocaine, which he and Karen are soon hooked on. The final scenes show a paranoid, out of control Henry totally wired from the coke, backed into a corner, the only way out being to turn government informant and enter the witness protection program. Turns out old Don Corleone, in that very different film 'The Godfather,' was right. Drugs did end up destroying the mob to a large degree. 'Goodfellas' shows that, but what an insane thrill ride it must have been... like a roller-coaster going a thousand miles an hour straight down into hell."
24595,True,"Masterpiece... 10/10I will accept any other point of view only if it is very well argued. That is because I loved maths as a child and I still do now. 1.Director-Scorsese is a genius.As a child, I liked to get near people like Goodfellas. It is the same world as this one directed by S. I had the same feeling.That means there's nothing fake in this movie=real art2.Actors-Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Paul Sorvino-three monsters I adore. Ray Liotta...Mmm...A real time mob playboy any healthy woman or girl would go crazy after (although in real life I understood he is a quite nice guy) 3.Action-brilliant well driven. It is a dream world...but only for wise guys! The only thing that troubled me is that after the incident with the FBI secretary and jail experience, the golden age ended. Nothing would ever be the same for Goodfellas.What scared me the most is that it was a stupid incident. Not a big event or a big change.No, something very easily to happen. Why did Henry choose to be a runner? Why he ended up the hunted and he had to do that stupid choice?After the incident, that something just broke up. They lost the paradise.In the first half-before the incident-everything was in its right place, I had a feeling of secure and optimism and happiness. In the second half, after the incident, everything was upside down, I was scared, I needed to find a way out. I would not have made the choice Henry made.If I had the time, I would see this movie every day. I am sure that each time I see it, I will discover a new detail which escaped me the last time.I recommend it to everyone who is smart, tough and enjoys watching a very well done movie.Definitely best mob movie of all times!!!Congratulations, Mr. Scorsese!"
24596,True,"Now don't get me wrong I love The Godfather I think it's one of the best ever, but this one takes the medal as the best mob film ever. Martin Scorsese is great and knows how to make an epic film work. I love how the mobsters were all street guys and had lived well, but not like royalty like in the Godfather. Some of these guys lived in regular homes. This showed a side of mobsters having fear that the feds were following them or listening in on their conversation as opposed to the Godfather where they seemed like they weren't worried at all at times. Plus Robert De Niro, Joe Pesie, and Ray Liotta are all top notch names and added realism to this epic tale of crime. Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest directors in Hollywood and this film is his masterpiece. If you haven't seen this film yet I highly recommend it."
24597,True,"Martin Scorsese's energetic and powerful style of film-making reached its apex with the 1990 release of Goodfellas, the film considered his third masterpiece (following Raging Bull and Taxi Driver). It is arguably his greatest work, and it will inarguably live forever as the ultimate execution of his film-making style.The ultra-tight, choppy editing of long-time Scorsese collaborator only adds to the excitement of this riveting tale of small-time New York mobsters spanning three decades. Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) grew up around the mob figures he eventually identified himself with, and became one of them at a very early age. He became partners and friends with local legend Jimmy 'The Gent' Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), also at a young age.Liotta's performance is one of a man that is blinded by material excess and permanently shaped by the violent and assertive people with which he surrounded himself. He rises, falls, rises again and falls again all within the 150-minute narrative of the film, and his story is the epitome of the old adage ""crime doesn't pay."" De Niro is subdued, yet stunning as Jimmy Conway. His lack of attention from pundits and fans is only because he disappeared so deeply into the role, you weren't aware you were watching a Robert De Niro performance. Pesci is nothing short of extraordinary as Tommy DeVito, an irrationally violent man who abuses his abilities as a mob figure to the point of going too far. He meets his comeuppance in one of the great build-ups and payoffs of all time.Scorsese's oft-visited themes of moral ambivalence and male assertiveness have never been so prevalent, and every single shot of the film has a purpose. The tracking shot of Henry and wife Karen entering the Copacabana nightclub still remains one of the great all-time long takes, as we are introduced to his world just as Karen is. There are several great sequences, including a montage of dead bodies seamlessly set to ""Layla"" and Henry's coked-up follies in the ""May 5, 1980"" sequence that demonstrates the virtuosic vision and talent that Scorsese possesses.It's a crime that Scorsese was not awarded the Oscar for directing and best picture. It was undoubtedly the best film of 1990, and is arguably the best film of the 1990s. It is a seminal piece of film-making that influenced the ""VCR"" generation of Tarantino, P.T. Anderson and several others, and remains the most exhilarating and power-packed 2 1/2 hour film since its release. For an unflinching look at the effect of power and excess on people, look no further."
24598,True,"Goodfellas will always figure as one of the best gangster movies of all time. It makes you transcend into a whole new world, i.e .a 'Gangster's world'. It's a world where the rules of the game are dictated by the person who's got the money & power. It is essentially the story of an Irish boy, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) who grows up in a gangster neighborhood & always aspires to be a gangster. It's the glamor, power, thrill & money associated with the life of a gangster that really attracts him towards it. The fact that gangsters are not governed by any law that is applicable for the ordinary citizen. He rises up the ranks from being a small time thug to an influential & trusted aide of a big shot named James Conway (Robert De Niro). It is this journey of his, which is the focal point of this movie. After joining the Gangster world, all his attributes reflect the influence of James Conway, who is someone he looks up to. Like most of the Gangster movies, even this one ends with the fall of its central character as he succumbs to the traps which are associated with Gangster world. It has the usual drugs & weapons angle also.One thing which really stands out in this movie is the direction & screenplay which makes you sit on the edge of the seat for the entire movie. The nuances of each & every character, including that of the wives of the gangsters is extremely well brought out & every scene is extremely powerful. Ray Liotta is average at best & I believe that Martin Scorsese could have done with a more intense actor. Robert De Niro is his usual self, but, the real show stealer is Joe Pesci. He has given a truly fantabulous performance. His character (Tommy DeVito) is similar to the one he played in Casino, that of a loose cannon who likes to use his gun, more than his head. Who can forget the whole 'Funny Guy' scene which triggers a series of laughter riots. The chemistry of the trio of Robert De Niro, Scorsese & Joe Pesci once again comes through after Raging bull & Casino.This is one movie which should be inducted in the Gangster movie hall of fame along with Scarface & Pulp Fiction."
24599,True,"Henry Hill : He is a kind of child who is inclined to disorder. So by the effect of surrondings he attended to a mafia. He was introduced with James Conway and Tommy DeVito. Before he got larger benefits with them, he had been directly working for Paul Cicero who is already a friend of Paul Cicero. I think Henry Hill ask himself that if I wasn't a gangster, what would I become? There is no answer for this question and so Henry found a way out to realize his dreams. Like most of the people who has got money and fame afterwards did, it isn't easy to get used to this kind of life. He came to the divorcing point and even he jailed after a fact that trio beated a man whose sister works in Federal Bureau. The time goes and Tommy is killed by the men of a killed mafia leader. After that the whole flow of facts change and Paul, Henry and Tommy's friendships are destroyed so that Henry squeals them to the police.Script and direction is upper-mediate. Actors and their performance are not needed to say lot of words. I especially admired Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito who doesn't grudge his bullets from nobody. Even if he is simply ridiculed by someone, he shoots him and he draw a cruel man image. On the contrary, Henry and Jimmy uses their brains more than the bullets. The trio reflects the behaviours of a classic mafia group. The most fascinating scene is that when digging up a corpse which is buried six month before, the words Tommy said to Henry is ""My mom is preparing sausage and pepper for us"".Between the it's similars, Goodfellas could be a good example upon explaining for mafia formation. But Goodfellas never could be a ""Godfather""."
24600,True,"I really enjoyed this movie and I thought it was very well done. A lot of people rave about some of the acting, but I think Ray Liotta did a pretty bad job and some scenes were just not right. I think it was extremely well directed and the long scene when Henry goes into the jazz club was perfect. I wouldn't even know how to set up a shot like that. I am not a director, but I cannot imagine it being easy with so many extras and and the timing must have been a nightmare. It really does set up the movie very well. I loved Tommy's character and being played by a smaller man makes it understandable why he was so crazy. I think the music was perfect. It started out with some great jazz vocals and then when one hears ""Cocaine"" riff in the background one knows everyone's lives are going to go to hell. I liked how it ended with a punk song. Such a good soundtrack. The way the scenes were cut were great. The first part of the movie started with a lot of long cuts that were smooth and then it got sharper and much more frantic. Full props to Martin (I don't know how to spell his last name) and I liked the use of actual people involved in the case. The one problem I have with this movie is that I cannot relate to any of the characters or what they are going through. The motivations even if they are real seemed silly and it is like a bunch of kids on a playground. No one could do that movie better and the casting of Ray Liota was the only thing I would have changed and it will be timeless, but I cannot relate to it."
24601,True,"I find it hard to believe that people write reviews to bash this movie. This is an excellent film, with excellent acting, and, of course, incredible directing. I like the fact the movie started at about the halfway point of Henry Hill's mob career. It's like something to look forward to after you've seen him rise through the ranks of the mob. He starts off very young, and they become his family.Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro are, as always, great in this movie. They play the characters that are so deranged and mental that it is disturbing; but somehow, you don't even realize it after a while, and you come to like them because of how they go about their business and how they enjoy each other's company.My favorite scene is after Tommy D. (Pesci), Jimmy Conway (De Niro), and Hill (Liotta) have just killed Billy Batts. They stop by Tommy's mom's house (Scorsese's mother in real life) to get a butcher's knife for the dead body. His mother wakes up and insists on making them a dinner in the middle of the night. They all sit and have a nice Italian dinner, and they all exchange light-hearted dialogue to relieve the tension of the previous scene of the brutal beating of Bill Batts.Overall, 'Goodfellas' is my all-time favorite movie, but shouldn't be enjoyed by anyone under 18 years old. 10/10"
24602,True,"And who was the one to directed it : Mr. Scorsese Scorsese made a true epic mob story who he was the only one to put the power, the writing, directed, the mood, The Life into the story, sometimes we even appreciate and want to be the part of these ""Goodfellas"". But at the end, we definitely don't, cause the mob is violent, cruel, there're betrayal, drugs, paranoid. All these things are not sweetening, it's almost real, the violence(Billy B. being hit by the ""Goodfellas)is powerful, some persons tell you this film is too violent but it's like that in the mob, no rules. The impact of this life destroyed a life, we see that many times too. But what make this kind of reality is the acting DeNiro as good as usual, Liotta too, it was one his first movies, and Pesci is terrific he deserves the Oscar.The directing is excellent Scorsese is a genius, the continuity is everywhere, just a reference in directing.A truly masterpiece."
24603,True,"Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" is an amazing film that looks at life in the Mafia. It tells the true story of Henry Hill, a former mobster, who is still alive to this day; it also relates the story of his friends and associates who he spends a great deal of time with in the film. Henry's (Ray Liotta) grandest dream as a young boy is to someday become a gangster. As he says, ""being a gangster was better than being president of the United States."" He grows up in a neighborhood full of them, and even gets a job at the cabstand which gains him respect among his peers. (During all of this, his parents become aware of his interaction with the other mobsters, and his dad cruelly beats him.) He continues to work and become more familiar with the neighborhood, including Paulie (Paul Sorvino) who he becomes very close to later on. Eventually, he is introduced to Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) who he begins working for soon selling cigarettes. From here, he first meets Tommy DeVito, who he will also become extremely close with later on along with Paulie. Unfortunately for Henry, he is caught selling one day and is immediately arrested. Luckily, Henry is smart enough to not reveal anything, and he is acquitted of the charges. Later on, the story moves into Henry's adult life where he continues robbing the airport and other places with his close friend Tommy (Joe Pesci). We learn more about Tommy from this point. What we learn more than anything else is how insane he is. He is obviously a complete psycho, and at his worst he kills people just for kicks. Over time, Henry begins dating Karen (Lorraine Bracco) who, while she seems close to him, is infuriated when one day he decides not to show up for a date. She stands him up, and this is when the connection between the two of them is soon about more than just a date.Over time, Henry marries Karen and they have two daughters. Henry's work starts getting more serious, and occasionally they have fights which result in Karen almost killing him. Tragically, Henry and his friends' killings go over the line and result in ***SPOILERS!!!*** Tommy's death.***END SPOILERS!!!*** Henry becomes a cocaine dealer and addict (despite Paulie's warning that if he messes around with it too much he'll disregard him forever) and earns a fortune from it. But, what he and Karen don't realize is that narcs are fully aware of his actions, and they arrest him one day. When they arrive on the scene, Karen, in panic, thinks that they are actual cops and flushes all of Henry's cocaine down the toilet (all of which is worth about $60,000). In the end, Henry has to become ""an average nobody just like everybody else,"" as he puts it. To conclude, ""Goodfellas"" is an absolute masterpiece. Martin Scorsese directs it with a master's touch, and the 145 minute running time truly flies by. The performances are fantastic (the best being from Pesci) in addition to the writing and editing."
24604,True,"OK, I'm not going to spend a long time on this film, mainly because I'm about to watch it again and I wanted to slip in a quick review.This film, basically follows the 'business' of a New York Mafia. The 'goodfellas'. The rise and fall of Henry Hill, whose story is told visually and in a narration by actor Ray Liotta throughout the film.It's one of these motion visuals and scripts that has gone down in history because of how good it is. People, to this day quote from it after sixteen years, and it will continue to have longevity.The cast, is superb, with De Niro and Pesci co starring along side Liotta, the films main focus. With Lorraine Braco and a host of other stellar actors to keep us not just interested, but entertained.It's a very violent and profane mob movie. I am the kind of movie viewer that does not honestly care for too much language and violence. I can live with it if it is within the context of the story. I am a Taranino fan because of the sheer style more than what is depicted of the adult nature.I would go as far as to say that most of the most renowned scenes in movie history are in restaurants: Casablanca, Reservoir dogs, Pulp Fiction, When Harry met Sally, Heat etc etc. This film is certainly no exception.""What do you mean I'm funny, funny how? Like I'm some kind of clown, I'm here to amuse you??"" (bringing some of the lines together without the language).I honestly could do without the F word as frequently as it appears, but I understand that it was a part of mob everyday life in it's frequency so I accept it. The violence is nasty, but there is no cotton wool padding in mob hits.All in all, this film is a must watch, and a must own for the movie fan with broad tastes. It is worth owning as part of a collection just to see what is arguably Pesci's best scripted performance.""The other day a group of kids from my neighborhood helped my mother home with the groceries. Know why? It was out of respect."""
24605,True,"Having seen this film almost every other week for approximately five years, I think its time to express my true opinion on one of Martin Scorsese's finest finest film. In this iconic mobster film, Martin Scorsese idyllically illustrates the corrupt, avaricious and precarious lives of three mutual, malevolent partners who orchestrate brutal acts of irrational violence to procure money, take on business ownership, and establish naval and trucking deals to generate gargantuan sums of money. The first scene is imperative, because it brings the entire film into a whole new perspective. The word ""mafia"" is used scarcely in the film, if not used at all, because the first scene sums up the identity of the protagonists in such a sublime way. It begins with an opaque image of an old vehicle rambling along a recently paved road out skirted with dead, scraggly trees. An audible thump, followed by the revelation of the blood deluged man whose lying in excruciating pain in the trunk and the beginning narrative along the lines of ""wanting to be a gangster"" set the entire saga in motion.We learn that the narrator has always wanted to be a gangster and followed by this want comes scenes of his early childhood life where he personally ran errands for smalltime mobs located in various fronts ranging from pizza parlors to restaurants. The first jobs were banal.. Innocuous store owners who refused to relinquish their businesses to the mob need only have their car windows smashed before their minds were changed. Periodically it would require more effort, such as the immolation of their vehicles altogether but they would give in sooner or later. This is where the narrator played his role. The insignificant errands, the parking of cars, the dismembering of cars and the conflagration of cars were all atrocities executed by him, but overall orchestrated by the mob. The narrator's childhood life plays an imperative role to his participance in ""real mafia business"" because it shows how ultimately necessary this life was for him. As directly quoted: ""For them(the narrator's parents) the cabstand was just a part time job, but for me it was definitely full time."" That's all I wanted to do. Manipulated by the propaganda that mob life was his destiny he isolates himself from the face of reality and follows his own fabricated truths. Due to the fact that working for the mob and being a gangster was so essential to him, he began disassociating himself from his parents at an early age and following his own whims and paths to success, until finally he had grown so attached to the strictures of mob life that he returned home to his mother one day in a stately suit, tie and considerably opulent formal shoes only to be remonstrated by his mother for ""looking like a gangster"". Another moral factor which eventually dies within the narrator in his childhood life is sympathy. When a man runs along the sidewalk, erratically vociferating that he has been shot, the narrator who is, at the time in the mob's pizza parlor, succors him, due to the fact that he had never seen a person shot and bleeding before and he ""felt bad for the guy"". In his adolescent life, the narrator meets and becomes very affable with James Conway (Robert de Niro) who is one of the main mafia mob leaders right under Pauline. Again his involvement increases and by the time he is an adult, the narrator is executing trucking heists on an underground market near the airport, a very lucrative underground market where Pauline gets the most for his ""protection"" the mobsters get their cuts and the trucking companies are deprived of their earnings. Later the narrator marries and becomes involved more in more, in heroin deals, a bank heist and the assault of a certain man who lands both Jimmy and himself and prison. Followed by the memorable and comical histrionic performance of Joe Pesci as Tommy deVito and the interesting classical music which arbitrarily plays during scenes of the narrator's early childhood and later in softer tones throughout the villainous executions of mobster deals and altercations, Goodfellas is an iconic classic which is categorized with other timeless classics such as The Godfarther part I and II and Pulp Fiction."
24606,True,"Minor Spoiler warning Overall, just a brilliant movie. It is vintage Martin Scorsese and is easily the best movie made in the 1990s, definitely one of the best ever made in history. We follow Hill for thirty years and we see the good times, the not so good times, and disasters of the Mafia. The ending is great and as Hill reflects on his life as a ""goodfella"" you truly understand what the life in Mafia is like. All the actors are perfectly cast and Joe Pesci easily gives the best performance of his career. Overall, the story weaves together perfectly and leaves you wishing that you could have sat down for one of the poker games in the back room."
24607,True,"The first time I watched this movie I was in awe of what I was watching, I think I was about twelve or thirteen and ever since then, I fell in love with mobster, gangster films. 100% historically accurate as told by Henry Hill, of the 50's mob scene. I personally view Henry Hill as a sell out, but none the less a historical figure in the history of the mob. My personal favorite scenes, are those of tommy's ranting of how ""funny a guy"" Henry thinks he is!, also the violent beating and eventual murder of a ""made"" mob boss in the trunk of Tommy's car and tommy's violent stabbing, and jimmy's unnecessary shooting afterward, the worst of it all they bury him in the woods of New York, and have to go back and dig him up six months later, not for the squeamish, and weak stomached. The story takes a turn for the worse when Henry turns to drugs for cash, and eventually gets ""pinched"" and rats everyone out, this film is extremely violent, but historically accurate, one of my all time favorite movies. Robert Deniro in one of his best roles as a mobster and Joe Pesci is magnificent as the very violent ""tommy"". Highly recommended as one of the best movies of all time."
24608,True,"I'm sure I am not the only one on this web site who gets into arguments with their friends about which mob movie is the best. Ultimately it always comes down to The Godfather and Goodfellas. It's like debating over who is better, The Beatles or The Stones? Both are fantastic movies, but offer two different view points on the same subject. I do believe that The Godfather offers a more romantic point of view of the mafia. Perhaps that is because it focuses more on the early years of the mafia. The good years. Goodfellas covers a longer period of time.Including the early 80's when the mafia began to fall apart due to its involvement in drugs.Regardless of whether you prefer The Godfather to Goodfellas there is no denying that Goodfellas is an amazing film. Total perfection. From the directing to the acting to the soundtrack. This movie is flawless.As much as I think The Godfather romanticizes the mafia, when you watch Goodfellas you'll find yourself drawn to the characters and lifestyle depicted in the movie. Goodfellas is THAT powerful. Are these ""good"" people? Hell no. But it's all relative. Yes, they are all scumbags, but some are worse than others. When you finish watching Goodfellas, ask yourself this: Are you ticked that it's over? Are you angry that Henry got busted? Do you want to punch the cop in the face when he licks the cocaine off of his fingers smiling at Henry as if to say, ""Busted!""Stellar performances throughout make this a must see for anyone who considers themselves a fan of film. How powerful are these performances? I happen to think De Niro deserved an Oscar simply for the way he smoked a cigarette. The scene where Henry confesses that he knew Jimmy was going to ""whack"" Morrie. Sunshine Of Your Love by Cream begins to play as the camera zooms in on Jimmy (De Niro) standing at the end of a bar, smoking a cigarette, pretending to pay attention to someone who is talking to him as he stares off into the distance in anger. THIS is my favorite scene ever captured on film and it lasted less than 30 seconds. This scene is why De Niro is the best living actor. Without saying a word his facial expressions are Oscar worthy.De Niro aside, the movie is loaded with talent. Hell, even Martin Scorsese's mom, Catherine, steals a scene.The plot follows a ""crew"" in New York. In the beginning they ruled the neighborhood and ran all the schemes. When it all fell apart ""one of their own"" sold them out in court to save his own ass. It's not a movie for the squeamish. The f bomb is dropped constantly and the violence is real and raw.It's been said that when watching The Godfather you almost feel as if you are watching a family's home movies. If that is true, then Goodfellas is like watching the home movies the family didn't want you to see. These are not admirable people. But like I said, Scorsese is so good at what he does, you will be heartbroken when it all ends."
24609,True,"How could a single movie accomplish all of this? It is the pinnacle of Ray Liotta's career. Joe Pesci is immortalized a gangster. It deepened Robert Deniro's already legendary acting career. It permanently embedded the name Martin Scorese in the minds of millions of fans as an awe inspiring director.""And when the cops, when they assigned a whole army to stop Jimmy, what'd he do? He made 'em partners."" Goodfellas did many things extremely well. How could anyone like, or even feel sorry for any of the gangsters in this movie? I find myself wondering how that could happen? But that's the genius of this movie, actors, writers, and director. Some how it's acceptable to like these characters. Yet in reality they are really despicable, violent people.""...It was among the Italians. It was real grease ball sh*t."" Goodfellas is based on a true story possibly best known as involving the Lufthansa Airport heist in 1970. It's told primarily through the eyes of Henry Hill, who joins up with Paul Cicero as part of Cicero's crew.""When they found Carbone in the meat truck, he was frozen so stiff it took them three days to thaw him out for the autopsy."" The story begins with young Henry, who has already figured out that he's going to be a gangster. As the story progresses, Henry is taken in by the crew and gains their trust, deservingly so. He eventually meets Tommy Devito and Jimmy Conway, partners who Hill will be with through the end.Materialism is rampant throughout the story, definitely it's a significant icon in this story. They all lead a rather lavish lifestyle, and are all willing to do whatever it takes to maintain it.Ultimately as they lifestyles rely more heavily on income and violence, this eventually leads to the crews self-destruction. They have drowned in their own excess.""See, your murderers come with smiles, they come as your friends, the people who've cared for you all of your life. And they always seem to come at a time that you're at your weakest and most in need of their help."" This is an epic cinematic event. In 1990, the events which this movie is based on were much fresher in the minds of Americans. However age hasn't changed the absolute top notch production this movie is. It is a spectacle of film art from beginning to end. The dialog is fantastic. Acting is fluent and very believable. The cinematographic aspects of this movie are as good as it get's. There's also a killer soundtrack.I've been a fan of this movie since I first watched in the early 90s. I will be a fan of this movie for the rest of my life.10/10"
24610,True,"This is an absolutely amazing movie and i have never seen a better one. i have loved this movie ever since i saw it especially when all of the bodies are being found i think that that music is so suited the occasion and the plot is ginormously great the whole way through, every time i watch it i only ever avert my eyes is so that i can blink so my eyes don't dry up, i go blind and never get to watch it again. i watch it at the very least six times a year without fail. any one who has not seen it should see it soon. i would like to suggest that you do not have to type at least ten lines every time you want to write a review for a movie and i hope you consider this change, internet movie database people."
24611,True,"One of my favorite movies ever. I have watched it 20 times or more, not sure bout the exact number. Well, I have kind of strong fondness for mob-movies but this is really the top of my chart. The one thing I like is the plot. It's not a simple plot when everybody knows the good guy kills the bad guy and there is happy-end. No... This is a life-story, I mean life. Life is so much more complicated than any simple movie. Goodfellas' plot is that complicated and intriguing too. At the other hand actors are brilliant. That was the movie which made me know the name Ray Liotta. Joe Pesci is just amazing in his non-stop talking style. De Niro this time is not the man who is always in the center of all that happens but is terrific although. If you didn't watch this movie yet - this certainly a thing you should do before you die...:)"
24612,True,"Every great movie has its flaws...bits and pieces you don't really like or skip after seeing it to many times...goodfellas succeeds to be a true masterpiece at a whole...the detail in this movie is amazing...everything is so subtle and works so good. Great performances by everybody that has a part in this movie, no wonder a lot of actors on goodfellas star in the sopranos.A quote about the character Jimmy Conway (bob deniro)jimmy was the kind of guy that rooted for the bad guys in a movie...as a viewer you become that guy...you want them to succeed in their crimes and really feel like being a part of this dark world. You re not only rooting for these guys, you actually want to be them, no matter how rotten their lives really are if you look at it carefully...sit back and enjoy this wonderful movie...10/10"
24613,True,"This film is arguably the best in the Scorsese cannon. In ""Goodfellas"" Scorsese seems to have created the quintessential gangster picture.""Goodfellas"" follows the career of a small time hood, named Henry Hil (Ray Liotta) who was friends with members of (but never really admitted into) the New York mafia. Hill, who would eventually betray and testify against his mafia cronies is not shown here as a sympathetic character by Scorsese, just as a young boy who grew up idolizing gangsters and then working for gangsters and then eventually befriending many of them. What he witnessed and saw while hanging around many of the members of the mob, later was used against them in their trial by Henry who became a witness for the prosecution. Scorsese does a magnificent job of introducing us into this fascinating world of the mafia. His attention to detail creates a vivid portrayal of the world that these gangsters exist in. He puts us front row center, as he introduces us (literally) to many different members of the mafia and takes us on their bloody adventures and allows us an unflinching view of the violence that was an everyday part of that world. With montages and voice overs, we are saturated with these characters, offering us a view into their mind, and their feelings and fears. Towards the end of the film, Scorsese creates a paranoid, and frantic montage that climaxes just has he pushes us to the edge of our seats and frays our nerves.There are fantastic performances by Robert DeNiro,Lorraine Bracco, and Ray Liotta, in what I consider to be his best film role ever. Joe Pesci achieved world renown fame as the short, funny,foul mouthed, homicidal gangster in this film (""What do ya mean I'm funny?!"") and the supporting cast is equally good and give this film a aurora of authenticity.Scorsese is a wonderful director with many great films in his cannon, however after a couple of viewing of ""Goodfellas"" I think you will agree that this is his finest film."
24614,True,"Goodfellas was one of the first great crime movies of the 90's. The 90's was an extraordinary decade with crime films like Silence Of The Lambs, Reservoir Dogs, L.A. Confidential, Fargo, Pulp Fiction, Se7en, and The Usual Suspects.Goodfellas follows the life of Henry Hill(Ray Liota) who grows up to be a gangster. The direction by Martin Scorcese keeps your interest in the film from the way the film starts to the way the film ends. He is really good with keeping the flow of the story going and not letting it drag out or go slow at any time. The film allows you to meet the characters and see what they are like, such as the cool guy gangster Jimmy Conway(Robert De Niro) and the hot headed Tommy Devito(Joe Pesci).The story follows Henry from the age of 14 on up. It shows how he becomes part of the mob, how he gets married to Karen Hill(played by Lorraine Bracco who later on played Dr. Melfi in The Sopranos). Other things happen throughout the story such as Henry having kids, getting involved in drugs, going to prison. The story really comes together when(spoiler ahead) the mobsters all decided to get involved in a heist. It seemed like the perfect plan until something goes wrong with one of the people involved. This is when things involving the heist heat up and most of the people involved in the heist get whacked. After this is when a lot of events from early on in the movie comes into play.Goodfellas is one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen. In just 2 1/2 hours it accomplished more than a lot of other mob films have. Director Martin Scorcese does a lot of good techniques to keep the film moving and make time go by without getting real slow. Everybody who wants to see a mob movie that is worth watching with plenty of entertainment should see Goodfellas."
24615,True,"!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS !!!!
If anyone ever thought they would like to be in the Mafia,I'm sure this would deter them. Scorcese shows the degeneration of Henry Hill (Liotta) from fresh faced kid to paranoid coke addict. All the people he admired either died or went to prison and in the end he is utterly alone. There is no honour among thieves seems to be what the movie is saying. Forget the notion of glamourous, honourable mafiosi, looking out for each other. These guys would shoot their own children in the head!I like the fact that even at the end of it all, Hill still hankers for the life of crime - he seems unable to rise above that and grow as a human being.Technically the film is very good to look at and the camerawork is great. I own this on DVD along with Casino and never tire of watching either. A deserved classic."
24616,True,"When encouraging people, who have yet to view this masterpiece, to get down the video shop and hire this wonderful film, I describe the opening scene. (*spoiler*) Three guys are in a car, at night. One of them hears a noise, so they pull over. One takes out a gun, another draws a knife. The boot of the car is opened to reveal a beaten up guy in distress. The knife armed fella proceeds to repeatedly stab the victim. Then the guy with the gun shoots him several times. It was this opening scene that instantly drew me in to this film, and developed my love for gangster movies. The only film to shock me in it's opening sequence the same way since then is Saving Private Ryan. A rare attribute in a movie indeed. So what about the rest of the 2+ hours of this movie? The casting is perfect. Old hands to Scorsese films, De Niro and Pesci must have been obvious choices. Pesci especially as the frightening Tommy. He even admitted in an interview that he scared himself at times. Ray Liotta has the performance of his lifetime, unfortunately it looks like he will never have the opportunity to top it. And Paul Sorvino proves the point that saying nothing can speak volumes in his role as mafia boss Paulie. The film covers three decades of the characters lives in the mafia and the music, costumes and settings help carry you through the years believably without trying to shove the time period in your face. The true magic of this film is that you are drawn into the characters lives, despite knowing that they are the sort of people that you would normally despise. This is done through the fast paced storyline and dialogue. You are continually shocked by the characters actions because, at the end of the day, life in the mafia is a life with friends who will shake your hand one day, and shoot you in the back the next. If you haven't seen this film yet, stop what your doing get down the rental shop, and 'make that coffee to go!'"
24617,True,"It is always difficult to choose one's favourite movie, especially when you are a movie buff. But ""Goodfellas"" has to be it for me. It has everything - great direction, top performance, well used soundtrack, a sweeping story and strong characterisation. For some people the moments of extreme violence are a spoiler but this adds intensity to a great movie. Make sure you see this if you have not already seen it. If you have, watch it again. A masterful movie maker at his peak."
24618,False,"Needs to be seen to be believed; in one word: perfection. Every frame, every voice-over, every song - it all comes together at the exact right moment to create the perfect film experience. This film makes you really understand and feel what makes the American mafia so compelling; in the eyes of a kid, who was unfortunate enough to grow up in a tough neighborhood, those gangsters are rock stars. Live fast, die young - but when you die, it ain't gonna be of a glamorous suicide or drug overdose - the ending will be brutal, ugly and sad. And it may very well be one of your best friends that will blow your brains out.I'll never get tired of watching Goodfellas; the entertainment value of this film is just amazing. It doesn't happen very often that every person involved in the process of making a film is at the peak of his/her game. And rarely do art and entertainment come together the way they did here. Storytelling with impeccable pacing, this is what it's like when a master composer conducts his masterpiece.

24619,False,"""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster."" -- Henry Hill, Brooklyn, N.Y. 1955.Gangsters are all around us. Everyone knows it, not everyone wants to accept it. ""Goodfellas""--based on true events--explores the lives of gangsters, chronicling the events through the eyes of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), who gets involved with the Mafia at a young age and continues his ""career"" throughout the film.As he gets older, he marries and has children, but still works for the organized crime family, under mob boss Paulie (Paul Sorvino); and he is friends with Jimmy (Robert De Niro), a calm, steady gangster; and Tommy (Joe Pesci), a wild man with serious mental problems. Eventually Henry's life goes down the gutter, leading to drug abuse and paranoia, that leads to other unfortunate incidents that will be ruined if I type any more about them.""Goodfellas"" is one of the best films I have ever seen. It's a tour de force of breathtaking images, witty scriptwriting, superb acting and realistic violence.Robert De Niro gives one of his best performances -- ever -- as Jimmy, even if he's not in the film as much as you might be lead to believe from the front cover.Joe Pesci is in this movie about as much as De Niro, maybe a bit more or less. But when he's on screen there's no doubting he's on screen--he's very hard to miss. A short, deranged, loud-mouthed man with something wrong in his head. Someone makes an insult toward him and he shoots them, and then laughs. It's quite disturbing. I am a huge fan of Pesci, and I tend to love his characters, but he really makes you feel sick towards his character in ""Goodfellas,"" while at the same time taking a strange liking to him. That just goes to show how good of an actor Pesci is.Ray Liotta is perfect as Henry Hill. I can't think of a better actor to play him. He captures a sense of innocence yet at the same time a feeling of violence. I love the scene where he walks over to a man's house with a regular expression on his face. ""What do you want, f&*^&?"" the man asks. Liotta continues walking, takes out a gun, and starts to continually beat the man in the skull with the butt of his gun. As Henry walks back to his car, his face is disturbing and his expression stays with you for a long, long time.Martin Scorsese is a brilliant director and his work here is fabulous; it's been recreated by other directors (namely Paul Thomas Anderson in ""Boogie Nights"") and there's a reason: it's great stuff. He totally deserved to receive Best Director in 1990, but of course he didn't. (Rumor has it the Academy frowns on Scorsese's use of racial slurs in his work. Oh boo hoo, get over it.)The movie is based on the true-crime memoirs of the real-life Henry Hill, whose novel with Nicholas Pileggi -- ""Wiseguys"" -- was adapted into a screenplay by Pileggi and Scorsese. The book itself was fantastic and insightful; the screenplay is even better. The dialogue is incredible.Anyway, ""Goodfellas"" has to be one of the best films I've ever seen--a true modern classic that will be remembered for what it is: One of the greatest tales told on screen. It's an offer you can't refuse!"
24620,False,"If there was one word that I could use to describe Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"": it'd be priceless.A surreal and deeply fascinating take on life of Henry Hill who was involved in the Mob for three decades and his rise throughout the time span (and Nicholas Pileggi's book ""Wiseguy"").There isn't a single moment in the movie where it doesn't miss a beat, you could only tell by the atmosphere of the time period and it seems so real.The performances in this film simply make it even more memorable and how the characters are portrayed here especially by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci (who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), and Paul Sorvino are believable and easy to understand that they were a family, very close and tightly knit to the core. Also, how director Martin Scorsese lets the movie pace itself and keeps the viewer off guard in what happens deserves a lot of credit."
24621,False,"Scorcese & Pileggi's masterpiece on the life of Henry Hill as a Brooklyn NY mob wise-guy. As much as the true events of Henry's life have more than likely been dramatised and glamourised to a certain extent, the essence of this film IMO is that it is still a brilliantly damning portrayal of the characters and lifestyle of mobsters.The sham of the mafiosi is exposed - preaching loyalty, respect & principles - but when it comes down to it they are just two-bit criminals that'll stab each other in the back for money or power over others. Each of them has an inflated sense of self-worth and stature that comes with being a ""wiseguy"", breeding with it paranoia that others are not giving them the respect they deserve.An example is De Niro's portrayal of Jimmy Conway. His outward persona is that of a calm and reasonable nature. But really he is a paranoid killer who at the drop of a hat would kill even his closest associates for money. I use associates rather than friends, as their relationships are of tolerance rather than kinship. Distrust, hate and jealousy through the forced smiles. Interesting that given this, certain people envy their life-style and would have loved to have been a wiseguy. I personally couldn't think of anything worse that being tied for life with having to keep the likes of Tommy company, but whatever rocks your boat. Some people have actually paid to see The Dukes of Hazzard film, so I shouldn't be surprised."
24622,False,"This is the gangster film at its finest. Scorsese is on top form as are Pesci and De Niro. Liotta has never bettered the performance he gives here. The film starts as it means to go on - violent, full of profanity, fast paced and very stylish. The story follows Liotta's character from boy to man as he climbs his way up through the ranks of organised crime. We see all the highs and lows of his life and meet a host of very believable and very undesirable characters along the way. It's a film full of memorable scenes whilst remaining much more than the sum of its individual parts at the same time. This is what all movies should be like. It draws you in and won't let you out of its grasp at any point. When it finishes you feel exhausted and exhilarated at the same time. If ever the word 'masterpiece' was meant to be used, it was for this film."
24623,False,"This is one hell of a film about the mobsters, based on a true story and coming from one of the great directors of all time. This is about Henry Hill, the narrator of the story, an Irish simple person who gets involved with the Mafia at a very young age and continues his life through it. There is no major plot in this film, just isolated incidents one of which was the turning point of Hill's life. Scorsese, as brilliant as he ever was, shows violence, sex and drugs etc in his own trademark style. And his actors helps him to make this film one of the classics.Robert DeNiro is not present in much of the film, nor his acting leaves too much impression. The three actors who really did their best job here are Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco. I hate to say that most youngsters today don't know too much about Liotta or how talented he was. I asked my younger brother about him and he said, ""The man who did the voice on GTA: Vice City?"". This is partly because Liotta did not get too many big roles after that, especially in recent years. But here he is just brilliant as Hill. It's Pesci's one of the best too. Playing a mad mobster with dark sense of humor wasn't his usual type. And Lorraine Bracco becomes the perfect lead female in such type of films.The film's got smart screenplay and excellent cinematography. And I don't know how many times Scorsese will be denied his Academy recognition. I hate to see a lifetime achievement award as his first Oscar. But things are going like that."
24624,False,"One of the best Mafia movies I've ever seen. This and The Godfather are movies I must recommend if you like gangsters, wise guys, etc. This movie is actually based on a true story. The real Henry Hill, who is the main star of this movie, actually said it was at least 90% true. He than said it was probably 98% accurate. This movie expresses a lot of the gangster ways and how they really did things.Summary: This is pretty much a biography on Henry Hill, who as a kid always wanted to be a gangster, and he actually worked for them. It shows how a young kid grew up helping the mafia and becoming a mobster himself. This is a true story and really shows what being a wise guy is all about.Overall: Definitely a 10/10 movie. Really makes me want to be a wiseguy."
24625,False,"Many people think Scorsese is a great director because he is a skilled craftsman who produces a clear realization of his own weirdly fractured vision. Given the reverence with which some people treat his work, any criticism may be viewed as sacrilege. However, this film is filled with wooden, cartoon characterizations of real people. They do very ugly things to each other, but without any understanding of their motivations.The movie drags on far too long thanks to countless scenes that should have been shortened or cut (e.g., the endlessly long prison kitchen scene). The transitions between different phases of the movie are abrupt and without explanation. For instance, the transition to drug addiction and trafficking comes out of nowhere when the main character pulls pills out of his pocket and swallows them on his way to jail in a limousine. No drug use is shown or even hinted at prior to that scene.While the movie certainly progresses over time, and there is definitely plot development, the cardboard characters don't really change, and every scene seems like a repeat of something we just saw. Unlike ""The Godfather,"" to which this film is sometimes compared because they both depict the ""inner workings"" of the East Coast Mafia, there is no deeper insight into any part of the human condition, and only the shallowest revelations about why the Mafia even exists. The only thing we are given -- explained in clumsy narration at the end of the movie -- is that all the participants are drawn to each other because they enjoy a sense of belonging: of being ""good fellas."" While the irony between that explanation and the extended depiction of these beautifully bonded people eating their own is certainly acknowledged, in the end none of it really makes sense, and we are reminded of that too-frequently quoted Shakespeare line:It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury Signifying nothingMacbeth was clearly talking about Goodfellas."
24626,False,"Goodfellas makes a strong case for itself as the most overrated movie of the 80s or any decade. Never in my life have I encountered a film less deserving of its critical and popular accolades. After watching it for the second time recently (to make sure my impression from a viewing years earlier was accurate), I feel every person involved in the picture, and particularly Martin Scorsese, deserves to be punished severely for inflicting Goodfellas upon me.Goodfellas has absolutely nothing to offer. It has neither the wisdom nor the compassion to say or reveal anything about life or human beings. Anyway, Goodfellas is not interested in that. It just wants to be smart, hip, and funny. With such lofty goals, it's a wonder this entire star-studded cast of actors and filmmakers fell so very, very short. Goodfellas is not smart. It is not intelligent enough to understand what it think it portrays on an individual or larger basis. It does not somehow explain or explore the mob psyche, the existence of organized crime in America, or anything else for that matter. Despite the fact that it is taken from actual events and people, it seems to desire no contact with reality.Goodfellas is not hip. Apparently Martin Scorsese was not aware that there is nothing less cool than trying hard to be cool. Goodfellas is full of flashy camera moves, tough looking guys in swank suits, and more fast, colloquial dialogue than you could beat out of Dashiell Hammett, but none of it adds up to anything but slime. Yes, that's right: slime. Goodfellas is so obnoxious you want to take a magical eraser and scrub each of its characters back into the pure white on the page from which they sprang. Is this an honorable aim for a film? To make you hate its characters, to make you hate its voice? Let me be the one to say that cynicism is generally a good cover for laziness, and as an approach to life it is one step above nihilism. Real cynicism has no place in art. Goodfellas is not funny. A complete lack of respect for human life is not a secret recipe for brilliant ironic comedy. It is disgusting, really, and those who laugh reserve a spot for themselves in the grime between the cracks under the bottom of the barrel of good humor.The performances in Goodfellas, much lauded, are ridiculously one-sided. How wonderful they managed to span the chasm between looking tough and looking smug - all except for Ray Liotta who has to do the balancing act between being paranoid and annoyed. Bravo.Of note is Scorsese's choice to play pop music over 95 percent of the film, presumably so that we have something to listen to while we are busy ignoring his movie.Goodfellas is trash. Utter trash. The only thing I took out of it is that it is unwise to let a gangster stand behind you."
24627,False,"Typical Scorsese effort: average crime movie script dressed up with great acting and pretentious, way overly stylish camera-work.I'm amazed this movie holds anyone's attention, let alone earns the ""best movie ever!"" praise you hear about this one. As I said, I didn't think it was bad, it was just wasn't that good. I had to force myself to keep watching, trying once again to see what other people see in Scorsese. I get the feeling all the praise and accolades heaped on him are just a big prank being played on me.At least the Godfather was an actual good movie, although certainly no masterpiece.A far, far better movie than this that came out around the same time would be Miller's Crossing. It's actually entertaining--you don't feel like killing yourself after watching it for just a few minutes, which is another thing about Scorsese I don't like. His slickness, bleak subject matter, unredeeming violence all combine to create an effect like a low-frequency earthquake hum or day-old shellfish--it's nauseating and depressing. I honestly spend the rest of the day depressed and joyless after watching a Scorsese film. You may say that's the power of the film maker, but I say that's simply the power of the subject matter. Manos: the Hands of Fate is pretty depressing for much the same reason.Art shouldn't always be uplifting (I love Bicycle Thief and the Year of Living Dangerously) but if it's going to put such misery on the screen then it should have a good reason for doing it and it should teach me something.A good example of how hollow the praise for Scorsese and his works rings is the famous Copacabana scene, a two or three minute steadicam shot following two characters from the outside of a nightclub as they wind through the kitchens and so forth and end up at their table. Scorsese's fans call this ""the best shot ever."" As I said, it's a long shot of a fellow getting a table. Kubrick did great tracking shots too, but the key to a great tracking shot, like any shot, is that it communicates something significant to us, puts us in the state of mind of the characters, etc. But this was just some people walking to their table. The difference is contextual and often subtle, but it's there."
24628,False,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits A film (one I'm sure you're all familiar with) charting the rise of Henry Hill, a young man growing up in a neighbourhood in 1950s New Jersey, who is in awe of the wise guys who lurk in his neighbourhood and the respect and power they command. With low prospects and an abusive father, Henry can see no other way to go than to become one of them and we follow him on his journey as he becomes ingratiated in them, the crimes he carries out for them, his marriage that starts well before going disasterously off the rails, a spell in jail after a job gone wrong and finally where he goes wildly off the rails when he starts taking/dealing drugs and him finally ending up having to testify against his former friends when he becomes a liability to them and they put out a contract on his head, which is still in force today.Robert De Niro. Ray Liotta. Joe Pesci. Three men with faces you wouldn't want to mess with and all perfectly cast in the leading roles in Martin Scorsese's legendary crime epic. All men are on fine form but, in ironically the lesser role, special mention to Pesci who steals the show as the wildly psychotic Tommy.Scorsese's masterpiece was one of the first films to really make use of the camera in new ways, from the long, lingering shot to the still shot, used excellently at various points in the movie. These are usually complimented by a fine 50s soundtrack playing over them, with some real lingering melodies from that era.The story works on two levels, both enlighteningly as an expose of how the gangster world and the gangsters themselves actually have very similar philosophies and worries as normal 9-5 people (with regards to families and staying on top of the competition) as well as showing just why the attraction to that life is so great (hitting home most forcefully at the end when Henry is forced to acknowledge that he'll have to lead the rest of his life like a 'shnuck!') and also engagingly as we watch a man rise from nothing to great heights only to lose it all again through his own bad choices and misguided loyalties. Indeed, as the film spans four decades, we do leave the film feeling as though we've known these characters for years.Coppola's The Godfather will remain the most accomplished crime epic of all time, but Scorsese's effort can never be scoffed at and will rightly remain one of the most well remembered films of it's sort, if you've got the stomach to sit through it in certain parts. *****"
24629,False,"Goodfellas is the story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) an ambitious young Irish-Italian American who becomes surrounded by a gritty world of crime and violence, set in '60s and '70s New York, while trying to climb the ladder of success in the Mafia. His two best friends are Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). The latter is one of the most vile and disgusting characters ever captured on film. His wife is Karen (Lorraine Braaco) and she seems to be the only one who sees where Henry is truly going if he continues to stay in this brutal life of crime.The film is based on the true story of the life of Henry Hill and what a life that must have been. A life of prisons, robberies, drugs, and hijacks is no way to live, but the main characters does all of them to keep his reputation and his fortune. He doesn't count on betrayal and death to turn him against that life of luxury, but he finds out that he must choose between the life of crime that's spiraling downward or a life of a rat that might have a chance to live in peace.That gritty world of crime ended up being too gritty for my tastes. And all of the characters were much too grotesque to be likable. Even our main character is a scumbag that doesn't know what he's gotten himself into until it might be too late. Since there wasn't one character in my eyes that I could relate to or that redeemed himself, I had to rate this movie like any other Scorsese film that failed to give me what I wanted. Therefore, I didn't like this film and am not surprised since all of the Scorsese films that I've seen up to this point were made in the same fashion.Somehow, the film went on to win an Academy Award for Joe Pesci as Best Supporting Actor at the 1990 Oscars. It was nominated for five other Oscars that year including Picture, Director, Supporting Actress (Braaco), Adapted Screenplay, and Editing."
24630,False,"Watching this good movie, you feel like watching the Sopranos,moving from one casual killing to another, with an italian family meal or two. Scorsese is so clever you're not bored any minute : situations are funny, suspense is there, both characters and actors are good. But you cannot go as far as liking the ""hero"" or feeling anything for him except a mild sympathy. so, all in all I give this movie a 7 mark but do not really understand its ranking, except if some have mistaken it for the godfather..."
24631,False,"Sad to say, almost everyone I know - at least, the males - who has seen this movie likes it very much. I enjoy it, too. I say ""sad"" because it's a sick film in many ways. Also, when you have 240-plus f-words in a movie, I mean, come on! In that respect alone, I'm embarrassed to say this movie is part of my collection. That's simply because it's a fascinating story, for the full 145 minutes.This is a rough film, to say the least. It's not just the language; there are some brutally- violent parts. Joe Pesci's ""Tommy DeVito"" seems to be involved with some of the worst of that violence Supposedly, the movie is a based on a true story but how much of this is true, who knows? It certainly provides a vivid portrait of Mafia life in New York City. I really loved the narration by Ray Liotta - who doesn't? - and enjoyed the music in here. Most people comment about the music; it's a good soundtrack. Pesci, Liotta, Robert De Niro and Paul Sorvino all make for extremely interesting gangster characters. With all the language, which includes at least 15 usages of the Lord's name in vain and some subtle religious cheap shots (not surprising considering who directed the film), the gory spots this film gets a little too rough-edged at times. I've watched thousands of crime movies, and this gets to be a little much here and there but if none of the above offends you, you're in for a treat with an intense crime story that is very watchable."
24632,False,"I suppose a lot of people found the characters in this film compelling and relatable on a basic human level. From what I saw, virtually all of the characters are low kinds of scum, always willing to betray one another and murder for kicks. The protagonist, played by Ray Liota, lacks the depth or redeeming characteristics that Cagney and Al Pacino's gangsters had. Liota's Henry Hill has very little that would make him seem like somebody to care about, because he's always willing to betray people and lie to save his own skin. When he gets his comeuppance, the viewer knows he richly deserves it, and will find no reason to take his side. His colleagues in crime, played by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, are equally irredeemable. The only decent qualities about De Niro and Liota is that they are not quick to condone random murder, as Pesci is always apt to do. The level of violence in this movie is gratuitous and disgusting. It does little to glamorize the life of crooks, and instead makes it seem like a low, loathsome venture.This movie is full of violence and little in the way of decent themes, as virtually all the characters are too slimy to convey anything relatable to the viewer on a basic level, except that we sometimes betray others to save ourselves. The acting is decent, though not something to write home about. The plot is winding and tortuous, so pay very close attention if you want to understand the action. The plot actually seems secondary, more like a framework for a menagerie of blood-and-guts and gangster dialogue. I do enjoy movies that feature prominent ultra-violence, like ""Robocop"" and ""Sin City,"" but those movies had deep characters and themes about morality that this movie does not explore. Watch it if you wish, but don't expect this to be the classic everyone seems to think it is.PS: Listen for the phrase ""you're busting my balls."" Virtually all the main characters say it. You could play a drinking game with this movie for all the times the characters say that phrase. This likely inspired a scene in the TV series ""South Park,"" where Cartman says this phrase to people who refuse his offer to buy aborted fetuses. Good times."
24633,False,"Why should anyone care about any of the characters in this movie? Not one seemed to have any redeeming virtues at all, beyond a certain amount of initiative to make something of themselves, by any means fair or foul. That they all came to squalid ends was good, but watching it happen seemed like pointless voyeurism."
24634,False,"By one of the most overrated directors ever. Mindless, incoherent, unceasing violence. Narration is almost always a bad idea in a movie and this movie is no exception. A little narration can be okay but when it is such a dominant part of a movie, it subtracts and doesn't add. But, more importantly, about half way through, I was sickened by all the violence AND depravity that I just couldn't stomach any more and basically ""skimmed"" (fast forwarding about 5 minutes to watch 30 seconds, repeatedly) to the end just trying to see something redeemable that would validate all the unwarranted hullabaloo that was given this piece of crap.The shame is that Scorcese has the ability to make great movies that include violence and violent personalities (Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull) but these are exceptions which everyone seems to remember and not the stinkers like The Color of Money, The Last Temptation of Christ or Goodfellas."
24635,False,"I didn't read more than a few other reviews and they were all 10 stars. I'm going to be the fly in the ointment and give it a 7, which still ain't bad. And it ain't - I mean isn't - bad at all, by any means. Nor, in my book, is it anywhere near great. Not by a long shot. It may be due, largely, although not sure yet, to Joe Pesci's one note characterization (way too typical of him). A little ""f"" word here and there never hurt nobody but goes just so far. It becomes not so much an aspect of his psychopathology but, with its over emphasis, weakens it, parodying what might be very legitimate. He was insane, and not a joke, but the character becomes jokey. How Ray Liotta did not get acknowledged for a much more realistic portrayal, and get at least a nomination for a part he brought dimensionality to, is a mystery. But, of course, the whole concept of an Academy Award is a mystery in and of itself. I mean, after all - Charlton Heston (in anything)?; Shirley Jones when you have Janet Leigh?; Rita Moreno opposite Judy Garland as well as Fay Bainter and Lotte Lenya?; not to mention the even more outrageous selection of Chakiris vs Clift and Geo. C. Scott?; Grace Kelly vs. Judy Garland????? Now, really! That one is going too far. And so on and forth. Give me Pesci in My Cousin Vinny anytime (not even a nomination). Aside from that - there were moments in the film that were clearly wonderful. Bracco and all the other molls getting their faces and nails done, scanning and re-scanning each of their thoughtless faces; the stop motion a dozen or more times capturing the characters silent, still; De Niro smiling at you with one of his 2 faces barely showing the 2nd face that will soon emerge and become the easy victor; the sense of confusion and then addiction that Liotta captures; the latter part where he describes in repetitive detail, in his drug-addled way, the order of the evening and transporting the pounds of cocaine to another city; dinner table with Mom and the 3 boys while the body in the trunk is writhing. Etc. A story told well enough in all of its pathetic realism. Scorcese is usually very good. It's this film that wasn't."
24636,False,"I did enjoy this film, but I think it gets a little too much praise. All three Godfather movies are far superior. This was innovative, but it ranks too high in all lists.Goodfellas is based on the memoir ""Wiseguy"" about Henry Hill's life as a gangster. Ray Liotta plays Hill and gives are star-making performance. Robert De Niro plays Jimmy The Gent and Joe Pesci earns a well-deserved Oscar as Tommy DeVito. Hill grew up in urban New York and wanted to be a mobster his whole life. Only, he wasn't cut out. Tommy and Jimmy were his best friends and extremely brutal. There was reluctancy sometimes in Henry. He marries Karen (Bracco) and their family life is well-documented. As Henry becomes more like the other thugs, bis life crumbles and surrenders to the witness protection program. I thought that the story was great as it cover major parts in Hill's life and some infamous crimes in American history. Scorsese also recreates some bits from the book that come out better in the movie. For example, he adds lots to the scene with Spider. I'm not saying this is the best mob movie ever like Roger Ebert said and I'm not saying it sucked. It will never reach The Godfather heights. Although the editing and film techniques were top- notch, it was not enough. One thing I didn't like was that it practically glorified being a mobster. There's so much loyalty and it makes it out to be fun. Being a gangster is not fun. Sure it's good that everybody is treated better, but they do horrible things that puts everybody in danger. Goodfellas does show that the mafia can be bad, but there's so many circumstances surrounding them that can be learned from. Another thing I didn't like was the music. The music was too loud and too good. Great music such as the Rolling Stones and Bobby Darin were playing. They proved to be distracting and did not fit well with some bit. Why not just use regular background music instead of hit songs that are overpowering? Then there's the flow and story. As I mentioned above, the story is good but does not come across to its potential. Some of the scenes go great by themselves but not all work well as a whole. They jump around too much without giving leads in or out. It just goes from thing-to- thing-to-thing-thing over the course of minutes, plus there's the distracting music. I don't mind 146 minutes, but it seems like 5 hours was condensed in half its time. Some parts could have been cut out and replaced with more flows and better plot development. Goodfellas is a brilliant flick, but not one of the best."
24637,False,"I realize that in many circles, this film is considered an absolute classic and possibly Scorsese's greatest. However, over the course of time, my perception of this film has changed. Having read ""Wiseguy"" by Nicholas Pileggi, I realized that this movie does not conform to the book all that much and tends to stray a great deal. While most of the performances are memorable, they don't really resemble the actual characters that the story is based on. Joe Pesci's performance seems way over the top to me although certain short scenes of his are hilarious. Overall, I'd say his performance was overacted. DeNiro, Frank Vincent, Lorraine Bracco, and Ray Liotta turn in very convincing performances and Scorsese's approach to this film was very unique and well done. One of the many overlooked features of this movie is the soundtrack. While not quite chronologically correct in some spots, it does tend to emphasize certain scenes. My major criticism of this film is that way too much time in the second half is devoted to Henry's drug problem. I felt that this segment of his life could have been summed up in one or possibly two scenes. But here, almost the entire second half of this movie focuses on Henry's drug addiction and dealing. Not necessary. Another criticism is that the famous ""Lufthansa heist"" is only mentioned here and not shown at all. I believe that this, above all, was the centerpiece in the lives of Jimmy Burke and Henry Hill and is not given enough attention. I would have preferred to see more detail about the heist and less about Henry's drug use. Other than that, it's a memorable film and worthy of a few viewings. But as an all-time classic, I don't think so."
24638,False,"Maybe I was so disappointed in this movie because I'd already seen the Godfathers and the Sopranos, but this movie couldn't have disappointed me more.I don't even know where to begin. The plot was dull and predictable. I realize it is based on a true story, but it was still boring.For the caliber of actors in it, I wasn't moved by any of the performances.The pace was choppy. The final half hour felt like an entirely different film.Very disappointing mob saga and one of the most overrated film of all time."
24639,False,"Exploring the rise and fall of a gangster, Goodfellas dawdles on Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) from his childhood when he first started as an errand boy for the local mob on across the street, to the height of his life when he unexpectedly has to make a decision that changes his life. By this time Henry is so entangled in the mafia that it has become his whole social life  from his friends, his wife, his job to his values  he is consumed in a camaraderie. The film is based on a true story and given its content and realistic photography approach, it feels strangely like a documentary. Director Martin Scorsese, who grew up on the gritty crime-infested streets of New York said: ""I remember seeing it on the streets and thinking, this is the way a movie should look like."" To convey this realistic tone, the camera thus coldly follows Henry around everywhere and it does not shy away from violence or unpleasant diversions, as is Scorsese's style. It invests the whole film in a behind-the-scenes atmosphere, where the director expertly wields a long, continuous reel of exclusive footage. Several takes are of steadicams gliding through the world for minutes, as when Henry and Karen park their cark, cross the street and enter the Copacopana where they are pampered by Henry's connections. It's raw and unflinching and truly absorbs you in Henry's life as a wiseguy, climbing the mafia hierarchy. He often botches his way through jobs; he has a hard time whacking people and he clumsily cheats on his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco)  the danger of the character is that you like him. Ray Liotta fantastically sews together the events as they unfold in a patient voice-over narrative flow. This flow is the film's fatal flaw. Sure, the pacing starts out nicely enough by having Henry slowly climb the mafia ladder along with his wiseguy friends Jimmy (Robert De Niro) and Tommy (Joe Pesci), both of whom are equally charismatic characters  the latter with rapid-fire dialogue and a rapid-fire gun and Pesci winning an Oscar for his colourful performance. It's all compelling at first BUT as is the usual mistake by Scorsese... he dilutes his film. It's like he got so taken with the mafia content that he wanted so much more of it for his own self-indulgence. There are numerous scenes that serve no other purpose than giving us a feel for the mafia family and the way things are run. It is true that some of them are important for establishing the atmosphere, but there are too many of them. The pace thus shifts from patient to lingering and the plot suffers countless detours and diversion into the life of crime. It loses focus.I cannot figure out whether this 'diluting the film' approach is Scorsese's style or an unfortunate mistake he keeps repeating in every film of his. Nevertheless, it makes Goodfellas dawdle leisurely without any clear sense of point or direction for long periods of time. Everything else in the film is fantastic, no hyperbole. Scorsese takes a deep plunge into wiseguy culture, indulging in mob dialogue that snaps and crackles like kindling in a fireplace, brutal hits, sleek heists and rats. He navigates moods, themes, characters, and popular music (which is used throughout as a background device) with expert skill and less than twenty minutes into the film, you are so absorbed in the characters' lives of crime that you know of nothing else. As for acting, it is Ray Liotta who grabs my attention as Henry, and not the resident scene-stealer Robert De Niro. I also fell in love with Lorraine Bracco's performance as Henry's Jewish wife  whose kickass attitude and sparkling personality translates well on camera. The greatest sheer presence can best be attributed to Paul Sorvino as the big-shot boss Paulie who, in spite of not saying a word until half of the film has passed, communicates a fantastic lethality. The reason the whole ensemble shines in their performances stems from the fact that they aren't acting like their characters; they are behaving like them. Of course the whole of Goodfellas is of the utmost quality but it could be even greater by being more condensed, as good most of Martin Scorsese's long-winded, diluted and slightly self-indulgent films.8 out of 10"
24640,False,"Here in Crete Greece there are many films shown during the night on TV so my wife and I use the users comments to decide which films to record to watch at a decent hour. This film being 19th in the top 250 film was a must to record.Without a doubt this is a well made film, with atmospheric photography and very good acting. The violence which we saw although harsh was artistic and thus a bit detached from reality. In fact we found the style of the film rather too artistic and atmospheric and after a 40 minutes we looked at each other and agreed we were bored by it. We could not relate to any or the characters in the film nor did we care what happened to them. So we turned it off and deleted it to make space for another film."
24641,False,"So is anyone else sick and tired of over-the-top ""Cool Gangster"" movies? I am completely burnt out on hearing about what a great movie this is. I watched it for the first time recently and was blown away by the ridiculous pervasive language and big ego-ed tough guy mobsters. Yeah, Joe Pesci is the epidomy of intimidation! This movie ranks right up there, floating around at the top of the toilet bowel with Scarface, and this mornings used breakfast burrito. I can't believe I hear people talk about how great this and some of those other gangster movies are. I doubt any real gangsters get to behave in any fashion remotely close to this without being arrested. My favorite part was when stupid little Joe Pesci gets murdered, as the end was undoubtedly near. Untouchables was better. So was Space Jam. Whatever goodfellas people. Your favorite movie of time belongs in the garbage."
24642,False,"You read around and you see ""Joe Pesci's best performance"", ""Masterpiece"", ""Scorsese at his best"", ""Classic mobster movie"", ""cinematographic perfection""... seriously these people are just mad. This is literally as follows: this guy shoots this guy, that guy shoots that guy, then this guy shoots this guy, for no reason, then this guy shoots that guy...I swear it just goes on and on. There's absolutely nothing that isn't linear, flat and dull about this film, it's just event after event, nothing subtle, ever, nothing about the state of mind of the characters, human condition, interesting dialog, nothing nothing nothing. De Niro is okay but widely anonymous. Liotta overplays a bit. Pesci's character is embarrassing (I know it's a biography, but still).It's interesting really because it shows all people want is mafia violence, they just like to watch the event of homicide, doesn't matter how/where/who/when... It's looooooooooooong. It never ends. And it's so incredibly irrelevant. I tried to see the good about it. Nahh....nah this is just garbage. And of course Scorsese picks the easy way out choosing to make this: just pick a mobster's real life story, put 3 renowned actors, write a dull screenplay, and film it. Everybody will love it: it's got De Niro, violence, mafia atmosphere, and the name Scorsese. This is just disgustingly bad taste."
24643,False,"Everyone has their ups and downs in their careers. Even Martin Scorsase does. Taxi Driver (1976) was excellent, and so was Raging Bull (1980), those two were Scorsase's up moments. Now this so called ""Goodfellas"", a flawed and overrated gangster movie by Scorsase based of the novel ""Wiseguy"" is where Scorsese went down. Goodfellas is a bad bad film!The Good: Cursed Words. The script is impressive the fact that it contains 296 uses of the f word and it doesn't really feel like it has been used that many times, yet the cursed word is used more here than in Scarface (1983), all thanks to Joe Pesci's character. That is probably the only good thing about this cursed film, the amount of cursed words. Thats Good.The Bad: Pretty Much Everything Else. The story revolves around Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a guy who has always wanted to be a gangster since he was a kid. The film shows the rise of Henry's success as he ranks up in the mafia over a period of 25 years. It sounds interesting rigth? Unfortunately the film has no meaning or purpose. Thats Bad. The film glorifies everything about gangsters. It makes out that shooting and killing is fun and the film turns this concept into a sadistic kind of comedy. Thats Bad Goodfellas is very violent, violent in all the wrong ways. More blood is added to exaggerate the violence when it really isn't required. The flashy cinematography is pretty awful and lame because all the shots look the same in nearly every scene. Thats BadThe Performances are average. I have no other comments on this. Overall: This is the moment when talented filmmakers turned to badfellas and made a movie called ""Goodfellas"", a so called gangster drama but actually sadistic crime comedy that is full of flaws. My recommendation: Watch City Of God (2003) instead. 1.5/10"
24644,False,"This film is a instant classic. It documents the life of Henry Hill and how he got into being part of the Mob. The amazing thing is that it's no fiction, even if it was, it's still beautiful. It's based on a book called Wiseguy written by Nicholas Pileggi. He met the real Henry Hill and made his story into a best selling book. Scorsese worked with Pileggi after liking the fast pace of the book, and they wrote the script. It was developed into this film. Casting is another great thing about the film, it seems that all the actors fit perfectly in their roles. It also has some really funny bits. Pileggi worked with Scorsese on another great Mob film, Casino."
24645,False,"Here's a contrarian opinion: GOODFELLAS is to be avoided unless you have a strong stomach and a proclivity towards sadism. A basically tawdry and sleazy story about a tawdry and sleazy bunch of mobsters is turned into a garish comic strip that is never quite funny enough to overcome the truly revolting violence, which is portrayed in as hideous a manner as possible. It might be argued that Scorsese is trying to make a moral point here, but it just doesn't wash. A truly repulsive film."
24646,False,"I have only just watched Goodfellas (yes, I know I'm 23 years late) and it is one of the best films I have seen. You just know a film is good when you've been watching over 2 hours and it seems like only half an hour.The plot is great and easy to follow. The cast is brilliant and all played their roles incredibly well. I personally thought Joe Pesci was the star of the show, he was just crazy and funny as well, a really likable character. Lorraine Bracco was also deserving of a mention. The action is extremely good and the set looks fantastic. Martin Scorsese really has done a brilliant job with this film. The soundtrack was also great and went perfectly with the film. I also liked how some characters narrated parts of the film, this really helped in parts.Overall one of the best films out there, it is one of those films that everyone just has to see at some point. Well deserving of its high place in the top 250 on IMDb and all the awards it has won.10/10 - A classic."
24647,False,"Most of the time when i see a good movie I come to IMDb, and read some user comments. I like to read the negative ones, to see how STUPID people are. Well today after i saw this movie (i'm 20 years old, but never saw this movie before - shame) i wanted to see what do other people say about it. This movie deserves 11/10 stars. I really REALLY don't know why didn't it got an Oscar, but it's pity. Now 1 IDIOT user wrote ""why do people rate movies like this so high?"" The only thing i can say is: Dude, life is not only pink and furry, you have to look at the other side of life, the dark side. In this movie you will find a superb story of how was life back then, when the mobs ruled all. Violence is this guys problem... Dude, take a look around, and see for yourself. There is MUCH MUCH more violence nowadays then there was back then, sad but true. And at the end of the movie Ray really broke my heart: he ordered spaghetti and sauce, and he got ketchup with cheap noodles - NOTHING is like it was back then.. EVERYTHING is falling apart, we eat junk food, have to ""wait in line"", quality of products drop, no good music... (just compare the Mercedes cobra to a new E class.. cobra's simply wouldn't break down - Mercedes almost got bankrupted - new cars, in 5-8 years u have to change em) but lets get back to the movie. Another user wrote ""WHY IS THIS BETTER THAN THE MATRIX? MATRIX IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER.."" well i don't know what to say.. simply no comment. How old are you kid? 13? Matrix.. good movie, but Goodfellas is 1000x better. You will find action, good story, betray, love and all in this movie. Tommy would kill you if he would read that matrix is better lol. and the most important thing is, that it is TRUE STORY. Geee... i wish i could live in the 50-60's. real life, true friends. Watch this movie, and feel it. I just love the old mafia. So brutal, yet so catching. always together.. in good and bad.."
24648,False,"This movie was an instant classic to me. From the second I pressed Play, I knew it was going to be great. And it was. A lot of people bash this movie for being a knockoff of ""The Godfather"", but it is in no way a knockoff. This movie is based off a true story first off. Also, there's no ""mafia"" or ""families"" really to speak of. And a majority of the characters are Irish, not Italian. I liked all the different characters involved, the wiseguys, the losers, the brutes, the smart AND dumb people, you name it. The fighting/shooting/heist scenes were perfectly executed (no pun intended). Ray Liotta is great as Henry Hill, he explains everything so well and makes ""the life"" look great. Robert DeNiro really proved himself once again in the part of Jimmy Conway. And Joe Pesci was perfect to play Tommy DeVito. All the supporting/side characters were great as well. I give this a 10/10, which I don't do very often but this movie deserves it."
24649,False,"The gangster film has been redefined so many times in cinema history it will be interesting to see how it is redefined once again. Goodfellas is a milestone film in that regard because just as Public Enemy and Little Caesar defined it in the Thirties, The Godfather trilogy in the seventies and eighties, Goodfellas set the standard that all other films including Martin Scorsese similar Casino try to meet. The interesting thing is that Martin Scorsese is young enough to redefine it again with another work.With Ray Liotta narrating his own life in crime in a flashback as real life criminal Henry Hill, Martin Scorsese offers us one fascinating glimpse of the criminal life in the Eisenhower to Reagan era. Henry Hill even as a child got sucked into the criminal life as a kid, as he said all he ever wanted to be was a gangster. Tutored by both Robert DeNiro and Paul Sorvino, Liotta takes part in one of the biggest heists of all time of Lufthansa Airlines at JFK Airport during the seventies. Goodfellas is the story of the events from Henry Hill's perspective leading up to the heist and the aftermath.For myself I've never seen the gangster mentality better expressed on screen except maybe by Sean Connery in Family Business. Liotta and Connery operate from the same mindset. If you work hard and hope it pays off in success, you're a dope. If you want something, just take it. When you come right down to it, that's how criminals think, it's the rest of us who are fools.Goodfellas was nominated for several Oscars, but came away with only one winner, Joe Pesci in the role of crazy Tommy DeVito. He's another criminal type, one who's driven by a terrible inferiority complex due to his short stature and does terrible things even to his own peers. And those peers don't forget as you see what happens to Pesci in Goodfellas. This turned out to be a career role for Pesci. He's a multi-talented man who's got an incredible range and can play everything from the Home Alone comedies to stone killers like here in Goodfellas or in Casino.There's usually a contest in which Scorsese fans argue whether Casino or Goodfellas is better. I happen to like Casino, but without the success of Goodfellas, Casino would not have been made.For a fascinating look at the criminal mindset, Goodfellas is an absolute must."
24650,False,"Goodfellas by director Martin Scorsese is by far my most favourite gangster movie of all times. It's one of those movies that, despite its runtime of over 2 hours, I can watch again and again without ever getting bored at any time. What it clearly sets it above other masterpieces of this genre like 'The Godfather' is that every scene gives me something. While many other movies of its kind tend to have scenes that get a bit tiresome or just aren't that interesting or entertaining, 'Goodfellas' succeeds to deliver top-notch entertainment until the end. This is, of course, thanks to the extremely well written script and to the perfect cast. Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro who play the main characters give so good performances, that I could not think of any other actor to play any of those roles and the rest of the cast is equally good. The movie has a perfect pacing which is also thanks to the narration of Henry Hill alias Ray Liotta. His voice accompanies us through the whole movie and is definitely a huge fun factor. He delivers his story so well that you virtually live through this movie with him. When he describes how he got into the organization and what it's like to be a wiseguy, you really comprehend and feel it. Then there are the technical aspects of the movie. The camera work is brilliant with very long tracking shots and scenes without a cut which take you as an invisible spectator along through the scenes. And last but not least there's the music. Scorsese makes use of well-known pop music of that time, which really adds to the atmosphere as a whole.In the end, 'Goodfellas' is my favourite Scorsese and gangster movie as well. There are very few movies (of that length and scope) that manage to deliver such a constant and high entertainment value from start to finish, but this is one that does."
24651,False,"To be frank, ""Goodfellas"" is probably the best crime movie ever made. It is more than just a movie; it tells a captivating tale; it is perfectly cast; Scorsese's direction is at its utmost brilliance. In fact, I'd venture to say that ""Goodfellas"" far surpasses what Francis Ford Coppola's much-loved ""The Godfather"" has to offer.In the first place, the entire sympathy for the characters of ""The Godfather"" depended on portraying them more as a dysfunctional family. This is not what a crime film should be. A crime film should be about *crime*, not men in tight suits pledging loyalty to each other. The characters of ""Goodfellas"" are, above all, gangsters. As a matter of fact, one of the very first lines is ""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster"". At the same time, however, Martin Scorsese does not glorify violence. He does not overemphasize blood spattering or disturbing death sequences. The violence here is realistic, precisely because it's cold, cruel, and emotionless. As a result, this film is one of the more realistic, plausible, and believable crime films out there.Another thing that is better about ""Goodfellas"" is its length, 146 minutes compared to ""The Godfather""'s 175. That might not seem like much at first, but think about it. That's just short of a half-hour. ""The Godfather"", as is, could've easily been trimmed down by an hour. That can't be said about ""Goodfellas"". Things just happen in the film; it's interesting all the way, even during its more contemplative parts. Additionally, the characters of ""Goodfellas"" are really compelling, but I will avoid going in-depth here.Martin Scorsese is, as I've mentioned, at the top of his game when directing ""Goodfellas"". One particular shot near the end stands out. Scorsese makes use of the (as I like to call it) ""Vertigo effect"" (ie zooming in while tracking backwards; the characters in the foreground remain approx. the same size while there is a significant shift in the background). This shot has been overused to the point of becoming cliché, yet it works effectively here. This is just one instance of Scorsese's fantastic work on this film. He constantly keeps the audience engaged in the film and the characters. In the blink of an eye, a scene can shift from comedic to horrific. Yet such transitions never seem jarring or awkwardly paced.One more thought about the film: the upbeat soundtrack that accompanies ""Goodfellas"" is actually really well pulled off. Whenever a song plays, it fits in perfectly with the action, both in melody and lyrics.The Verdict: This is what a crime film should be all about: realistic, entertaining, gripping. ""Goodfellas"" is just about flawless.Overall Rating: 10/10"
24652,False,"'Goodfellas' is right up there with the best of Martin Scorcese. I recently hauled this out for a re-viewing and I was surprised at how totally up to date it felt. How relevant the plot was, how topical the story.And for a mafia movie of that era, how the women were brought front and centre and given a narrative voice - Karen Hill (played by Lorraine Bracco), the wife of the protagonist, Henry Hill (played by a riveting Ray Liotta) both get to tell their stories.The movie is based on a true story and the cast are awesome. At this later viewing I was particularly interested to see many of ""The Sopranos"" cast, here making their debuts in a similar crime-family drama.The movie is astounding in that it brings complexity, a riveting script, brilliant relevant music (with actual stars performing their hits) and mind boggling tracking shots, the most difficult of all movie sequencing. Scorcese, or his ensemble, do not flinch from the complexity of this and afterwards, one wonders at how many takes were involved.We are drawn into the intimate life of a crime family, the gradual desensitizing to the horror of the life, driven by material greed at any cost, including the callous snuffing of lives.The large ensemble cast (both known and unknown and including both of Scorcese's parents in brilliant sidebits), the cinematography, editing and dialogue are all masterful.De Niro is at his charming best,Joe Pesci captivates as a psychotic, insecure 'made' man Lorraine Bracco is masterful in a fully developed role, Ray Liotta is marvellous in the way he depicts the reality of the hoodlum life, the juxta-positioning of sauce making against the back drop of victim burials. Paul Sorvino, Michael Imperioli, Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas and Kevin Corrigan all add to the over all engrossing engagement of the film.8 out of 10. Not to be missed."
24653,False,"Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is quintessentially one of the greatest movies ever. It is better than The Godfather in my opinion because of its real life approach to mob life. The film follows Henry Hill as he is brought into the mob life at a young age and how it brings him down at the end. The movie is just amazing to watch as it is like watching a documentary on the what is like to be in the mob. Adding to it are the amazing performances put forth by Ray Liotta as Henry,Robert De Niro as his friend Jimmy the Gent who is great in it and Lorraine Bracco who is very good as Henry's wife. But the performance worth mentioning is Joe Pesci's awesome performance as Tommy De Vito. His acting in it is one of the best performances I've ever seen. The film follows a time line from the 1950's to the 1980's and with it accompanies one of the greatest soundtracks ever put together. Scorcese has a knack for putting great soundtracks together and this is one of the greatest he's ever produced. Goodfellas is one of the greatest movies ever and one of Scorsese's all time best."
24654,False,"By and far the largest complaint I hear from people is the use of voice-over in film. Many complain of how it destroys the purpose of a movie as a visual medium. ""The actors should convey emotion through their acting, not through voice-over,"" these critics might say. I argue that in certain cases, voice-over can make a film better. ""Goodfellas"" is my proof that v/o helps a film (as well as terrific direction, masterful cinematography, Schoonmakerian editing and a killer soundtrack, but those are givens in a Scorsese flick). How else could we really understand Henry Hill's incredible story of prosperity and joy which eventually turns into one of paranoia and depression?""Goodfellas"" is the story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a low ranking soldier (or something like that) in boss Paul Cicero's crew of Brooklyn wise guys. It's also about his friends and partners in crime Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco). It begins with good times spread around, but due to some poor decision making on everyone's part, the good times don't last long.""Goodfellas"" is a mix of black comedy and dark drama which is all the more affecting because of the humanity of the two main characters, Henry and Karen Hill. Karen is especially sympathetic due to her innocence. She tries to rationalize her husband's actions in her v/o, as Henry explains everything he thinks in his v/o.Back to the point of v/o: It is necessary for Henry to speak his mind in v/o because as ""Sopranos"" creator David Chase said, these guys usually are lying when they talk to their fellow mafia members.The one thing I haven't mentioned is the incredible acting by the whole cast. Liotta and Bracco shine here more than anyone else in the cast. (Yeah, Pesci is the most memorable part of this movie according to many other people, but he was much better in ""Raging Bull"" as was De Niro*. That's saying something about ""Raging Bull"" because Pesci won an Oscar for this film.) Everyone else here was great too.Overall, Goodfellas is a must see for any Scorsese fan. It's my favorite movie of his and I think his magnum opus. Marty grew up around these people, so who better to tell their story? *Robert De Niro is excellent movie he does. He probably even did research on the CIA and the florist industry for ""Meet the Fockers""."
24655,False,"Scorcese's masterpiece, that's probably the best way to describe it; he takes us on a journey through Henry Hill's (Ray Liotta's) life, from boy to man, as he climbs through the ranks of the mobster scene, and Ray Liotta gives the performance of his life. Supported by great characters portrayed perfectly by Robert De Niro, Lorraine Bracco and the star of the piece Joe Pesci; this movie simply overflows with style, talent and guts.It's incredibly violent and it's brimming with vulgar language, but every bit of it is warranted as a piece of the picture. Now i am the first to admit that i am not a big fan of gangster movies, but i cannot fail to appreciate the magnificence of this excellent film.It's better than Casino (7/10) and it makes the godfather (6/10) look tame by comparison.Goodfellas (9/10) and its genuinely worth it"
24656,False,"The worst thing that could happen when you are watching a movie is that you don't care, you couldn't care less. That is what happened when I saw it and mind you this is no lousy production or a B-movie, I mean the main actors are people like Deniro, Sorvino, Pesci... It doesn't work.There is nothing intriguing, there is nothing ironical. Ray Liotta starts jazzing right away taking himself oh! so seriously and I couldn't care less. All characters are unpleasant. This movie is completely off balance.The inside scenes are too dark. The light is terrible. And I am sick and tired of these Scorsese movies with the background music so loud! Hasn't anybody noticed that the voices of the actors are barely audible?"
24657,False,"I was first introduced to Scorsese's work with 'Taxi Driver', and was immediately compelled to rush out and rent 'Mean Streets' and then Scorsese's first, 'Who's that Knockin'?' Although these films were both uneven in places, I still saw the same brilliance. So of course I had to rent 'Goodfellas', right? It is in everyone's top 100. And I was monumentally disappointed. There was no struggle with moral issues. These guys were just violent jerks for whom I had no sympathy. I *wanted* them to get caught so someone would get them off of the street (and off of my TV screen). Ray Liotta is such a pretty boy that he could never match DeNiro or Keitel in my book. And the violence in this movie was just sickening and unnecessary. Sorry, folks, disagree with me all you want, but I'm sorry I ever decided to watch 'Goodfellas' and I haven't felt compelled to pick up a Scorsese flick since."
24658,False,"I admit it; I'm an action movie guy. So a film about the mafia should be right up my alley. But I'm often turned off by dramas. It's not that I don't respect those who like fine art. I do. But personally, I lack the sophistication or training to appreciate the makeup or sets or choreography if the plot is awful and the characters unlikeable.That's what gets in my way when I watch Goodfellas, which I've seen twice now but couldn't get through it the 2nd time. The protagonists are nasty and I couldn't identify with them. This is the same thing that turned me off watching ""Pulp Fiction"".Superb acting, story, some real drama -- but how ugly and why would I want to watch this?Who should see this film:-- art types / drama lovers: a must-see-- action movie types who don't mind when the protagonist is violent and awfulSorry, but at least I've stated some real reasons for giving Goodfellas only a 4 out of 10."
24659,False,"Martin Scorsese-directed modern-day mobster drama adapted from Nicholas Pileggi's book ""Wiseguy"" by Scorsese and Pileggi involves Brooklyn youth in 1955 who gets drawn into the gangster lifestyle, first as their gopher, later as a major player. Joe Pesci is frightening as a psychotic ball-buster and won a Supporting Actor Oscar, yet Ray Liotta is even better in the central role, and Lorraine Bracco is excellent as Liotta's wife. Exceptionally well-made film is gratuitous in its usage of a certain expletive and cannot overcome one major obstacle: despite its attempts to show the ugliness of Mafia life, the movie is constantly undermined by a distinct romanticism of its own violence. The infrequent narration by both Liotta and Bracco is a distraction, as we are often being told exactly what we're seeing on the screen, but the creeping paranoia is palpable and the drama played out is disturbing and gripping. **1/2 from ****"
24660,False,"This has everything a movie should have. A great story, acting, cinematography, direction, (I will never understand how Scorsese did not win his 1st Oscar!) production values, I can go on and on. There is nothing that isn't done perfectly on this film. If this were to come out in any given year it would be considered a classic. I understand that there are the hardcore devotee's to The 1st two Godfather films, but to me (and many others) this is the quintessential gangster film. I used to watch this film over and over and I usually try and nitpick even some of of the all time great films, but there is nothing I can pick on in this film! I had kind of seen Scorsese films before and really liked most of them, (Taxi Driver, & Raging Bull especially) but ever since ""Goodfellas"" I would follow everything he did. I didn't follow the Oscars when I was a kid, but was shocked to learn this didn't win Best Picture however the fact that ""Dances with Wolves"" did was one of the few times I wish the Oscar should could have been shared. As much as I loved ""Wolves"" ""Goodfellas"" has held up as the better picture. If you haven't seen this film and consider your self a serious film afectiando you need to see this before you are laughed at by actual filmphiles."
24661,False,"Quite simply one of the greatest movies of all time, the Deniro Scorcese partnership in full flow Pesci is absolute genius Liota inspired,and Sorvino well it was the role he was born to play. The casting is inspired the editing the best in Film history and the narrating even inspired the Shawshank redemption. Its iconic, slick, cool, over violent and sickening all screwed into one great movie. There's really nothing else that need be said about this film which is perhaps the greatest ever and in my opinion far superior to the great yet overrated godfather. It's just absolutely flawless, and if pushed to find one i'd say its the fact that the budget isn't large enough"
24662,False,"I am really sorry but this iconic movie is unbelievably flat. I know this movie means a lot to many people. I was pretty disappointed when I saw it. I forced myself to see this movie in 4 stages just because It had a rating of 8.7. I couldn't sit and see it all at once. I know it is based on a true story, but it would have been much more exciting if the narrator dies at the end to break the monotony of the story line. Everything about the script was predictable. I raise my hat to Joe Pesci's performance and the exceptional skills of Martin Scorsese ...Other than that, I can't find a reason to give a rating higher than 6. May be it is a just me seeing this movie in 2016 i.e. 16 years after its release..."
24663,False,"I was bored in study hall, it was a Friday before a long break, so I decided to watch this movie. Have you ever listened to a song compressed to an unreasonable size? This is what this film is. Crushed to a time of around of 72 minutes, this story could really use two. The truth is, this film doesn't convey anything. There's no central point or conflict. ""Pulp Fiction"", a much better film, pulled off the lack of a main central conflict, but without any characterization, or a sense of a real journey this film suffers the same fate as the boring ""Aviator"". The story of a real person with a lot of glitz and gloss galore in every seen but a severe lack of content. Every seen moves very fast and everything happens instaneously and they use a narrator to fill in the blanks of information they use narrators. Characterization dies and a quick and painless death in this pointless script. I'm pretty sure the book writer and writer of the script had a central conflict or point of the film in mind when they wrote it, however, it never comes out in the film. This movie is just bad."
24664,False,"Thought I should finally see this movie last year because it is one of those movies ""you have to see"".  Cinematography notwithstanding, I found little to draw me into the film.  I want to say that it has been dated, or perhaps too often imitated, but having just rewatched The Godfather I see what a good mafia movie should be.  In a nutshell, the violence was expected, the dialogue was simplistic, and the plot went nowhere fast.  I fought to stay awake awaiting a huge climax that never happened.  But that is only my opinion, and a lot of people seem to like it, so judge for yourself."
24665,False,"The movie showcases deniro and liotta at their best, with pesci acting in his usual gangster role. However the film is too long, without a tight plot for support. hence after watching for two hours, one starts wondering when the film is going to get over. while the film has some very funny and quite believable scenes, it ends up being another one of scorcese's film glamorising gangsterhood."
24666,False,"The best thing about the movie: Joe Pesci was simply amazing.  I thought it was a good movie, but the ending left me somewhat unsatisfied.  I would put it in my top 5 gangster movies, but I don't think it even comes close to ""The Godfather"" or even ""A Bronx Tale"" as far as mafia movies are concerned."
24667,False,"Chalk me up as another reviewer who found this movie to be vastly overrated. My wife and I saw it a couple nights ago, for the first time, and it just pales in comparison to cinematic triumphs such as The Godfather movies or The Sopranos.As much as anything else, there are no likable characters. Part of the reason you could keep turning in to The Sopranos is that you could genuinely like and identify with the principals, despite their brutality and crimes. Here, you can't. None of the principals have any displayed virtues: at best, they're shallow and two-dimensional.Yes, the highly lauded soundtrack has many tunes. But if you're going to use the hoary old tactic of advancing pop tunes down the years to denote the march of time, could you not be so flamingly anachronistic as all of that? They were playing 40s tunes in the doo-wop era, 50s doo-wop post-British Invasion, 60s psychedelic pop in the 70s, and early Eric Clapton in the disco era. Get the freaking DATES right.Speaking of anachronisms, the film's jammed with them, and while it's superficially a glittering, gritty portrait of the wiseguy life and the wiseguy era, the goofs just overload. Cars too late for the year. Phones too late for the year. Livery too late for the year. Did Scorsese bother at all with accuracy and continuity, or did they just say ""Eh, get an old looking car out there."" It pains me to read about how exacting and painstaking DeNiro was to get every aspect of Jimmy's personality true to life, exactly how the real Jimmy Burke did, in the middle of a blizzard of anachronisms.Most damning, there's just no dramatic tension. There's little by way of plot, little by way of suspense. The actors did good jobs with the material and direction they were given, but that's not remotely enough to sustain this seriously overrated flick.5/10."
24668,False,"Goodfellas is a joy to watch. Joe Pesci is in his comfort zone playing a tetchy little New York Mafiosa hard man. De Niro almost takes a backseat to Pesci. Liotta, as raconteur, delivers the story pitch perfect.So why only 5 out of 10 (""bing a bang"")?The characterisations are marvellous but the message is an empty bag. The message is merely that ""might is right"" and life is short. The bigger you are, the more friends you have, the more weight you can throw around. Well, we know that. We knew that when a nuke was dropped on Hiroshima.There is no sincere message from the movie. There are plenty of lovable characters but nothing else to feed us. You get more, much more, from Allen's Broadway Danny Rose. From the Godfather you learn about the organisation of the underworld.However, they say movies are more about character than plot. Maybe that applies to the message too. It's good. It's fun. But you don't learn anything from it other than a few syllables that every other kid at college would know. In Goodfellas, life is so simple it's makes me wonder why I bother to pay my bills."
24669,False,"Scorsese has combined ambigiuos camera angles and solid acting to make the greatest movie of all time.To the set pieces and costumes and the script, this stands alone as the greatest.With real events and deep characters,Goodfellas surpasses the age of time and reaches the limits of movie-making.Ray Liotta is a funny,charismatic Henry Hill who seems to love the gangster life style and its rewardsJoe Pesci shows how maniacal senses and unstable actions can make a great movie characterRob Deniro is at his best with Jimmy Conway.Not only is his acting on par with the greats(Brando)but shows real emotion"
24670,False,"Hey all movie lovers out there. This is my first visit on IMDb and I like what I see. Iam a big fan of almost every movie genre there is, you just cant say that one type of genre are all bad. Keep a open mind. But of course there are good and lesser good movies . Goodfellas are one of the best gangster/mafia films ever made, you got the best actors ,like Joe Pesci ,Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta. Ray did his best performance ever. For me this movie just have a very mafia is feeling surrounding the hole story. And we can all give Martin Scorsese the full honor for that . Like in many other films. Eks.Casino. In Goodfellas you have a lot of scenes that are so well played, you can see the camera standing on one place all trough a scene,filming three or four guys and still the realness don't disappear for one sec. They make us believe it. That is damn good acting. So if you don't think Goodfellas is a movie worth seeing, take a closer look. Leon Ya"
24671,False,"Goodfellas is one of the top movies in the history of cinema, nominated for best picture (and five other Oscars) considered by many the top movie of the 90s, so how can it be underrated.put simply, it is underrated because the Godfather (parts I and II) are so brilliant. The sad thing is that, because Goodfellas is a gangster movie, it will always be compared to other gangster movies. for some reason, movies in that genre (gangster/organized crime) are never looked at as individual pictures, but are forever compared and put up against other gangster films. The only exception to this rule, is the godfather of all gangster movies, the Godfather. this is probably because it is the first of its kind (not the first gangster movie, but the first modern-style gangster movie), most gangster movies made after the Godfather are complete rip offs of the Godfather, but every once in a while a movie like Goodfellas comes along that may be similar to on the surface, but is then written off by many. when I say, written off, I mean that it is not getting the credit it deserves. it is a masterpiece, yes it is a gangster picture, no it is not the Godfather. Many people admire it for what it is, but if the Godfather hadn't been made, or even if this film wasn't always compared to it, it would take its deserved place in cinema history. that place is not as a good film, and a great gangster film, it is a artful, entertaining, and near flawless film, and one of the top two greatest gangster films."
24672,False,"Think back: has Scorsese ever made a good film in his life? No, he hasn't. You don't even need to think about that one. Does anyone ever wonder why Scorsese has never won an Oscar? It's because the movies he makes are terrible. End of story. In this train-wreck of a film, Scorsese has the actors bumble across the screen for 2 and a half hours muttering in God-awful ""Italian"" accents. Scorsese probably thought he could capture the brilliance of the Godfather trilogy when he made this film. To say the least, he failed miserably. I pity those who consider Goodfellas a classic. This film is FAR from it. So if you rent this movie, anticipating 2.5 hours of entertainment, approach with caution."
24673,False,"Martin Scorsese - I never really felt the things he puts in the movies. His stile is slow, imaginary, unconvincing... half if not most of the characters act roles that don't belong to them... I mean I'm sitting here watching the movie for like twenty minutes and what I think about mainly is what was the point of the story - twenty minutes and it takes you nowhere...? Well gentlemen, I have some more interesting things to do with my time. I mean the only class in this act is De Niro, though what is he doing in such a boring product?!? What I said and all I said is of course in my own opinion. Pleople who enjoy Scorsese's inconceivable ""tallent"" for making stories... - have a nice time. Me - I already know... never watch Scorsese movies."
24674,False,"I have been looking at the top 100 movies list of IMDb and it is becoming so disappointing. The top 6 movies are of crime, murder, action and mafia. Casablanca is the only movie that is of its own category standing out alone at 7th place; but this time I at looking at GoodFellas at spot 17 - all time great movies.The story is based on true events and characters from a novel named ""Wise Guy"" written by crime reporter Nicholos Pileggi. It is about this boy Henry Hill born (Ray Liotta) in 1943 in a poor working class family who wanted to be in a gang since his boyhood because that gave him freedom, money, and respect from people. He joins hands with Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro). This trio starts by hijacking, stealing and selling goods from huge truck loads. Once arrested Hill starts dealing in drugs in prison and when out continues to do so. In the end, with difficult times, of police after him, with new enemies and having difficult times with his wife Karen (Lorriane Bracco)  he decides to be an informant to avoid prison sentence and gives in most of his gangster friends  good fellows! The movie is directed by Martin Scorsese, who like Tarantino has earned his reputation with cold blooded killing of people and mafia movies. He directs the movie well in all departments and combines with ample social, family and drama scenes to balance the dark narrative.All the actors have acted well, but the best in the lot is Joe Pesci who has played the weird cranky character of Tommy with such conviction that it should be remembered just for its sheer portrayal of characteristics. Ray Liotta who gets to play the central character is okay and his career till date shows that he has lost himself into mundane small roles. Robert De Niro is as good as ever and shows his brilliant insight to understanding deep dark characters  he loves to play.The movie progresses from 1950 till 1980s and Martin captures all those eras with much ease and details.Even though his movie is in the top 20 list - lately, seeing many of these mafia movies  I do not feel that much excited. It has become routine and mundane for me to watch the cold killings, glorifying killings, blood everywhere  showing crazy characters who pull out gun at any point to shoot someone. I feel sick at times for the world and the good directors who have not got over showing it on big screen.Just a trivia, Henry Hill is still alive but suffering depression and fighting alcoholism and spends most of his time in rehab centers.(Stars 7 out of 10)"
24675,False,"The first title that will come to most people's mind when thinking of mafia films is inevitably 'The Godfather' - a timeless classic that many consider to be the greatest movie of all time. However, as good as 'The Godfather' is, there's something about 'Goodfellas' that I enjoy more.Maybe it's the way the story is told, or the fact that the violence in 'Goodfellas' is a lot more ruthless and brutal. It also has more entertainment value compared to the plot heavy Godfather. Whatever the reason, 'Goodfellas' is a film I enjoy immensely and is up there as one of my favourites in the crime genre.Aside from the story, 'Goodfellas' is a near perfect piece of filmmaking, with a witty and intelligent script, brilliant acting throughout, and terrific cinematography. 'Goodfellas' is a near flawless movie."
24676,False,"One of the best mafia movies of all time. Scorsese delivers a picture so rich and energetic it is nearly flawless. It is funny, smart, violent but endlessly re watchable and still holds up decades later. Its one of my favorite movies and demonstrates that Scorsese is still to this day one of the best directors working in the industry. Goodfellas is in my top 5 movies of all time and arguably his best movie."
24677,False,"As an Italian I think the film portrays my people in a bad light, although I'm not Sicilian and hope people do realize there is a difference between Italian and Sicilian. Having said that, all in all a good film, full of action. I also am not a fan of De Niro and Bracco, they both irritate me to no end, especially Bracco in that whiny, nasal voice of hers. On the other hand Ray Liotta gives a brilliant performance as usual."
24678,False,"Now Hear me out, I really like this film and if you like it, Great. I think the film has great dialogue, great setting and great cinematography. However I just cant seem to enjoy it on the level everyone else did, finding hard to believe that organised criminals would act so brazen and careless about everything. I Don't think its Scorsese's best either. Much preferring both Taxi Driver and Casino thinking Casino to be a true representation of organised crime while still containing a good plot and great dialogue.I do recommend this film for all to see despite this because it is Captivating."
24679,False,"""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster."" -- Henry Hill, Brooklyn, N.Y. 1955.Starring Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro.Written by Nicholas Pileggi ( Novel) and Martin Scorsese.Directed by Martin Scorsese.First of all I'll say that this isn't normally the kind of movie I watch. In fact I think ( apart from Bugsy Malone which probably really doesn't count) this is the first Mobster movie I can remember watching, It's a proper guys movie. I'm a guy but I'm not that much of a geezer. This is probably to movies what Top Gear is to TV.It's quite long but it did keep my interest all the way. The acting performances are decent without there really being any stand out performances. Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci ( is he really not related in any way to Joe Paquale?) were probably the pick of the bunch amongst this star studded cast of big nosed very Italian looking actors.Robert De Niro didn't really play a big part and for most of the movie it felt like he was just going through the motions and doing a pretty decent impression of himself, if that makes sense.The cinematography was good and there there lots of laughs, shocks, blood and twists along the way which I'd expect from a Scorsese film. The big problem from my point of view is that there isn't much of a plot. It's very artsy but there isn't much of a plot to keep me that interested. And I prefer a plot to grab hold of. That's probably because its a true story and they didn't want to make up too much stuff in case they offended the wrong people. I mean would you want to p*** off the mob?Overall this is a decent movie if you like this kind of thing. It's not really my kind of thing but it's still worthy of an 8 out of 10."
24680,False,"Very difficult and complicated to start thinking about which movie is the best of Martin Scorsese, I think there is no such a film, which always works great films of this soundtrack, just any movie right on the mark, the film is now in my opinion is much less appreciated what else out more movies like that and in my opinion "" Goodfellas ""is presented more as a kind of gangster comedy, a celebration of film that I think about crime drama I can think of"" The Godfather ""and"" City of God ""ranked after"" good guys ""(and rightly so), anyway, Director Scorsese's great with great decor, even cast fantastic and unexpected end, Overrated still too high and is located in IMDb Top 250 and still honor Scorsese with De Niro Liotta Joe outs and all the good guysThere are too many jumps between scenes in my opinion there is no real depth. Long film depicts a lifetime, but as the film shows a Mafia/ at least one crime in his life, I can note that when you do not manufacture and deepening interest in the characters, you just can not make a connection between the character and the viewer. Unfortunately, it happened to me.8/10 in my opinion"
24681,False,"Goodfellas has got to be one of the best mob movies I have seen. Not only that, it is probably the best Scorsese film I have seen so far. The acting, the dialogues, the setting, everything in this film is brilliant. Anyone who watches this film is guaranteed to love it. The plot is based on a true story of a real life mobster Henry Hill. It follows his beginnings as a kid growing up in Brooklyn who eventually works for a crime family. The reason why he wants to work for a crime family, is because ""as far back as he can remember he always wanted to be a gangster."" Henry's life as a mobster forms the rest of the movie. Henry Hill is played by Ray Liotta, an actor that I wish to see more on the big screens. His portrayal of the real life gangster is as realistic as it gets. From the mannerisms to the speech delivery, it is almost like we are all thinking this is a real gangster. Robert De Niro plays Jimmy Gent, who takes Henry under his wing and in a way mentors him. The other guy Jimmy takes with him and who eventually works with Henry is Tommy DeVito, played by Joe Pesci. This to me is the best performance of the film. DeVito is a character with a short fuse and Pesci played the character to perfection. This film shows why he is one of the finest actors of his generation and why he won an Oscar for his role. To me, his performance is what you will think of when the movie is over. All in all this was a fantastic film and definitely one of the best mob movies ever. As I said before, everything aspect of the film from start to finish is incredible. This is a film that no one should ever miss, especially if you are one who loves mob movies."
24682,False,"I grew up loving the Godfather movies and this one was damn good. The way the story is told through the eyes of one of the characters only helps to draw you into the story. The relationships within the movie were well played and since this movie, I have declared Ray Liotta certifiable. Joe Pesci, who I usually find funny, began to irritate me but Paul Sorvino's Pauly truly made me feel like I could identify with these characters...he was awesome! The rest of the cast really helped to pull this amazing movie together. Then to find out it was actually based on a true story, WOW! There is no way that you can watch Goodfellas and tell me you didn't enjoy it! I did and I am super finicky with what I watch....I not only give this movie 2 enthusiastic thumbs up but I encourage you to re-watch it if its been a while!"
24683,False,"I remember that this is one of the first films that I've ever seen that deserved to be called a ""classic."" I was absolutely mind blown, I was even shocked that the film is two and a half hours long but had just been sucked in for so long.This film has some of the best acting you will ever see in your life. Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci (who deserved his Oscar), Robert De Nero, Lorraine Bracco. Everybody was fantastic ! Everyone just deserved an Oscar. Ray Liotta and and Lorraine both gave effective and entertaining voice over narration and even the smaller roles from the likes of Samuel L. Jackson where entertaining.The music was incredible, there is no score, its more of a combination of famous songs from the 50's 60's and 70's (matching the decades in which the film is set) and they all work, none of the songs feel shoe-horned, and they all pleasant to listen to.This is Scorsese's best work, which is a big claim, and well earned. The shots were all great, including the tracking shot that has now become world famous and is taught in film schools all over the world. The use of lighting, the atmosphere were all at a level of perfection that only Scorsese can.This is one of my favorite films of all time."
24684,False,"Wow. This film is it. This is everything that makes a good film great and a great film legendary. Based on a true story spanning 30 years in the Mafia, this translation of Henry Hill's story to the movie screen was executed perfectly and stands as an obvious classic 25 years later.Absolutely everything in this film is on point. The directing of 'Goodfellas' by Martin Scorsese is something of a landmark in film itself, how the man didn't win an Oscar for best director for this is beyond me. However, Scorsese's job must've certainly been easier whilst directing this set of actors who absolutely blew me away. The set and costume designs were also fantastic as they create a world that sucks you in and consumes your brain for it's run time. Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta are both superb in portraying their characters and bringing them to life for an audience on the big screen, De Niro is tremendous as usual and Liotta was a perfect casting choice for Henry Hill. Liotta's scene where he walks across the street to confront the man was sexually harassing Karen and then begins to bash his skull in with a pistol is seriously one of the most memorable, timeless and also haunting scenes in the film. Henry Hill's anger and expression stay with you for a while after that scene, despite it being pretty short. Whilst my hat is off the whole cast and crew behind this absolutely timeless classic, the man my applauds have to go to Joe Pesci. Pesci's portrayal as Tommy in this film is sensational, he owns the screen in every single scene he is in and undoubtedly deserved his Oscar for this performance. The improvised ""How am I funny?"" scene chokes you out with tension, tension only really being there because you never know what a man like Tommy DeVito could do and that is something Joe Pesci represented in this perfectly.In my opinion, 'Goodfellas' is one of the greatest films of all time that has the perfect mix of sensational writing, acting and directing, bringing it all together to create a memorable and beautiful film that is re-watchable over and over."
24685,False,"The movie itself its notorious for being one of the best gangster films ever made. Centred on the book 'wise guy', it focuses on how Henry Hill a former gangster worked his way up through the mob family. Without reading the book I didn't know what to expect from the ending which I thought was brilliant. The combination of De Niro, Liotta and Pesci work excellent in this film as you witness them grow into the film as like brothers working under Paulie. I think this movie provides everything you would want to keep watching....Action, Romance, Suspense and even a bit of humour thrown in. Ultimately I would argue this as one of the best movies I've ever seen. If you haven't seen it, its a must watch!"
24686,False,"What makes Goodfellas such an enjoyable film for me would have to be its hard hitting, witty dialogue. If I have to pick a film that is a winner script-wise, Goodfellas would definitely be one of the top contenders. With a script like this, there are many lines that are good enough to be quotable, and it's very long list to choose from. And the desired effect is not only achieved by the script, it had to be the select number of people who be up to the task at bringing out the sharp wit of the characters and we have a cast that really shines in that department.With Ray Liotta playing Henry Hill, his performance in letting you in on the character by putting you through his perspective with his narration alone is enough to pull you in and become captivated by the film. And as he pulls you into his world, we get introduced to numerous criminals he gets mixed up with such as Tommy DeVito played by Joe Pesci, who he plays with a lot of intensity that brings out a lot of the brutal elements in the film. When on screen, you can always sense something is going to go wrong, and what Pesci brings to this character is deserving of all the praise.Every character evokes that sense of intensity that really gives this film its distinctive edge, but one person I seem to be captivated the most by in the movie would have to be Robert De Niro's performance as Jimmy Conway, who is crazier, but in his own more methodical way that is a lot more subtle than Tommy. What Bob brings to the table is something special that again shows how versatile he is as an actor and gives me another reason as to why I think he is the greatest actor ever. He may not be in every scene, but he is the foundation of the movie for me.These are all great performances that help to bring out this story and to know that these are true events makes this film even more insane than it already is. While The Godfather felt more graceful and has placed a heavier emphasis on subtlety to make the violent scenes have more impact when they happen unexpectedly, Goodfellas is sharp all around its edges. Whereas The Godfather was violent, it offered insight into the human aspects of the criminals and the reasons they murdered for business. That sense of sentimentality is nonexistent in Goodfellas and offers a bare bones, raw insight into the crooked lives these criminals were leading, and with that, you get a story that is sharp like a knife that when it hits you, you'll know you'll never forget it."
24687,False,"SEVERAL SPOILERS HERE...This movie is great. The acting is superb, history is awesome and characters (especially Tommy) are unbelievable. I really don't know how many times i saw this movie. Every time when i saw it i replayed several moments in it.That was: legendary scene ""what the f**k is so funny about me?"" :) this scene are one of the best scene ever made in film and Tommy DeVito also is one of the best character ever created. Joe Pesci is unbelievable here (i think that this time his acting beats Robert De Niro pretty hard:)). This sequence is very funny and at the same time you can feel the threat that is coming from all movements of Tommy. Also i was stunned when i saw acting in sequence when Tommy talks with Spider. Of course, Tommy does not only talk with him ;).(Michael Imperioli is better when he acts like a waiter here than like a mafioso in Sopranos:)). Also very well done is scene where Henry , Tommy and Jimmy are eating at Tommy's moms house. It's very funny and very ironic.So i named some best moments in this film. Believe me, when these moments are joined together, we get crushing combination of humor, thriller and drama. It is full of gore mob life. It is 'Goodfellas' And don't forget to ""go home and get your f**king shine box"" :DDD Sorry about my English :)"
24688,False,"Goodfellas is a great film about the underground world of organized crime. There are great performances from Pesci , De Niro , and Bracco. The movie is based on a true story which makes it even better. There is a great script and never a dull moment. The right kind of music seems to sink in at just the right time. Brilliant film techniques such as narration , freezing , and flashbacks. Definitely one of Scorsese's best. Although he once again got passed up for best director. Joe Pesci gets a well deserved Oscar for  best supporting actor."
24689,False,"Based on a true story.  I drove a truck (younger years) daily through Idelwild Airport before it was renamed JFK Airport.  Rest assured - the mob ruled.  Forget the goofs, this was real life in the late 50's, early 60's. I also had conversation with Henry Hill in a cocktail lounge in Manhattan (New York City) in the 80's.  This flick works!"
24690,False,"The movie is an insight into mafia life. It shows you the different characters a gangster could be rather than the ""so cool"" impression you can get from a film like ""Analyze This"". The performances are all excellent, but the movie lacks a solid plot - there is no story to follow or anything to want you want to continue watching. I basically kept watching to see if anything cool would happen last minute or something.Not impressive at all, I am actually surprised it was on the list. I would say, watch The God Father again or The Sopranos and don't waste your time."
24691,False,"Over rated piece of %#@!.  Why a movie that glorifies the scum of this planet is so popular is beyond me.  People should know better than think that foul language and gratuitous violence  makes a movie. One word describes this poor excuse of a movie, ""pitiful""."
24692,False,"Just take a look at the top 250 list. Which movie has been at the top ALL the time (except for when Lord of The Rings was new and manage to race to the pole position and stay there for a couple of days)? It's Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"", based on a book by Mario Puzo!The Godfather is said to have been premiered in 1972 (I won't know, because I wasn't born back then), and during all the time I watched ""Goodfellas"", i couldn't help feeling how much of a wannabe Martin Scorsese must've been when he directed his version of a 1900's mafia movie. He couldn't even write his own look-alike script, he had to do it JUST like Coppola and take a book about the mob and make a movie out of it. I'm not saying I could have done it any better, but how much of a rip-off isn't this ""Goodfellas""?Nothing wrong about the execution of the movie shooting though. Good actors, although I'm sick and tired of seeing Robert De Niro as a mobster. I'll give this movie a 4 out of 10."
24693,False,"From the film's opening to it's conclusion I was hooked. What at first appears to be a glorification of the gangster lifestyle gradually evolves into a cautionary tale, graphically depicting the violence and treachery of this way of life. Based on the experiences of real-life ex-gangster Henry Hill, one-time associate of New York's Luchese crime family, the film gives an inside look at organized crime as it really is. Joe Pesci as the murderous Tommy DeVito absolutely steals the show. It is worth the price of the DVD just to see this talented and versatile performer in action. Ray Liotta gives a good performance as Henry Hill, but is overshadowed by Lorraine Bracco, who plays Henry's over-the-top wife Karen. Robert DeNiro's performance is so-so. Overall, I'd rate this an 8.5/10."
24694,False,"One of the best Mob movies ever. Robert De Niro can always look dangerous. Ray Liotta, as always, looks like a total weasel. Good casting. Lorraine Bracco was great here, as was Paul Sorvino. But the real performance came from Joe Pesci, as the Academy recognized. I first saw him as the buffoon in the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies. Here, his unstable dangerousness (it's a word, look it up) oozes menace right off the screen. This film is very different from the Godfather films in that these characters are blue collar hoods, rather than top bosses. To me this brought home even more the evil, law of the jungle, credo of the mob. Very powerful stuff.NOTE: I have the DVD, and the sound on it is not so good. The voiceovers and music are very loud, and the regular dialogue much too soft. It had me adjusting the volume throughout. C'mon, guys, for what DVD's cost, you can do better than that."
24695,False,"I really hate that such a small-minded movie is always compared to the grand The Godfather. Whats the point? Gangsta-Crap? Oh no, some-when teenage was over for good.Maybe it's not worthy any word that could explain how this one misses real class in so many aspects, but hat one should be said: it's no more than a whining comedy diary of a boring careerist with weak civilian motives whose coward character creeping out of coverage in the end.To let it have been kicking it would have needed more contrasts, more shadowing and suspicion, more mystery and puzzle, more dramatics and development instead of so much blah blah blah.Nice if you are a kid that can't walk by itself, but otherwise an annoying waster."
24696,False,"I will begin by stating that I am not a fan of the mafia genre.I am merely watching and reviewing this film because of it's status as the #94 film on the American Film Institute's top 100 films in cinema history.I will give high marks to the cast,Robert DeNiro,Joe Pesci,Ray Liotta,Paul Sorvino,and Lorraine Bracco for their performances,as they play these types of roles very well,especially DeNiro and Pesci.I just don't connect very well with mafia story lines,as I feel that they only serve to glorify the real mafia.I will not question any of the AFI's choices for best films ever,but as a matter of personal taste,I have to say that I just don't like the film as a whole,and will probably never view it again."
24697,False,"This film is considered the definitive mob film, probably more because Martin Scorsese is quite possibly the best living American director. If Francis Ford Coppola (director of ""The Godfather"" trilogy) were still alive, he may disagree with this assessment -- and if he did, I would have to agree with him.Granted, the direction is brilliant, especially on the opening credits, the beginning of Liotta's flashback, the psychedelic feel of the end, and the stunning tracking shot that introduces Liotta and Bracco's first date, but there are so many postmodern innovations that the viewer is veritably jarred. With repeated viewings (which have made this film a classic) this alienation is felt less so, but there is nothing here to challenge Coppola's christening scene.Nonetheless, not enough can be said, especially about this movie's acting. Pesci's star-turn is celebrated, but kudos must also go to the always underrated Liotta whose subtley suits his role perfectly. De Niro is wasted but good playing the role he always plays (could he be anything less than good?) and Paul Sorvino is perfectly understated in a supporting role. The real praise must go to Lorraine Bracco, the only character to experience a full spate of emotions. She is the most convincing female character ever in a gangster film and doesn't have enough scenes, to my taste.The plot - what little there is - weakens the film. The main character's ambiguous goal is to become a gangster, but this does not drive the film. Events happen to him, rather than grow out of his own actions making him difficult to sympathize with. The unsatisfying ending is too quick (as if Scorsese knew his movie was getting a tab bit overlong) and also unsatisfying, though he did the latter on purpose as a point of theme.Overall, a must-see film, though I prefer the better-directed and more engaging plot of ""Casino,"" which, unfortunately is often-panned as a rip-off of this film. Both film's are ridiculously and violent unlike the early Hollywood gangster flicks which were juist as - if not more - thematically effective."
24698,False,"HOW IS THIS MOVIE IN FRONT OF THE MATRIX ON THE TOP 250?This movie is the worst ever, and the Matrix was the best ever! This movie was simply pathetic!Just because Robert Deneiro was in this movie doesn't mean that it's good. Just because he was good in other movies does not mean he was good in this one. This was just not a part for him. And Martin Scorsese really screwed. I just can't express how much of a dissapointment this was, and how much of a dissapointment it was seeing it rated so high.Do not see this movie. Give it a 1 on the rating."
24699,False,"Ah yes gangsters  , a bunch of misunderstood criminals , or at least popular myth would have us believe . They`re nice to their moms , kind to animals and children and if they have to kill someone ..... well it`s business , no hard feelings . You know the cliches and Hollywood is more guilty than anyone of propping up these myths and it`s great to see a Hollywood movie deconstruct these fictions . GOODFELLAS shows gangsters as they are : Violent thugs and contemptable cowards . Very few films have come up with a bloodchilling villain in the shape of Tommy and the most terrifying thing is this evil little b@stard existed in real life . Oh and despite all these hard men strutting around letting everyone know how tough they are in reality they`re sh*t scared of doing hard time , there`s no honour amongst thieves and these tough guys would cut their mothers throat to stay out of jailScorsese directs in a MTV inspired way . With the exception of Spielberg all great American directors were doing this at the time . Oliver Stone did it with BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY , HEAVEN AND EARTH and NATURAL BORN KILLERS , Francis Ford Coppola did it with his version of DRACULA and Scorsese would continue the style with CAPE FEAR and CASINO . Scorsese directs in this style with just the right amount of excess so the movie doesn`t suffer from being overdirected in the way CASINO was ( CASINO is basically an overlong , inferior remake of this film ) while the script by Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi is just about the right length and - Unlike CASINO - is beautifully paced and allows the audience to make up their own mind on Henry Hill who only seems to be an innocent bystander throughout events - Yeah right
Warner Bros are rightly remembered for their classic gangster flicks of the 30s and 40s . They made another gangster classic in 1990 , and this time they made a truthfull one"
24700,False,"I love the brutality and profanity of this movie, I don't think it deserves to be one of the greatest movies ever made, but right until the end is enjoyable to watch. The end should have used some editing to make it more tight. I hate Joe Pesci with all my life, he is a terrible actor and he always does the same schtick in all his movies....he is annoying and dirty, i clapped when he was shot dead!! I also could not believe how many visible mistakes are in this film!! for example they show a shot of 1963 pre-JFK airport showing a 747 jumbo jet!!!!! the plane did not make its public debut until 1969!!! little mistakes like this bother me and destroys the ""look"" of the film......also Robert Deniro's first appearance on the film..he is supposed to be 28 years old...yet he looks 40!! WTC ? Overall i love the sex, violence and profanity but needs a good editing!"
24701,False,"This movie is considered a classic and yes it is certainly of a classic quality. It has the rhythm and realism missing in many modern movies. It has actors that fit their roles perfectly. But what is it's point? I mean, technically you have all the ingredients right here, but nothing exciting ever happens. Is there a great drama here? Or great action? Great dialogues? Something to think about later?Seems like the movie's sole power comes from it being a biography of Henry and the Mafia. like their way of life by itself is supposed to charm with it's glamor and money. Perhaps it really did in the past decades? These are people who steal money, and murder each other mostly over small arguments. They have no grand visions, grand confrontations or dilemmas. Even the big heist is never shown.The characters are grotesque and very simple-minded so it's very hard to connect with them. They reach no pathos, nor develop. If this story is real, it paints a very miserable reality that is hardly glamorous or amazing."
24702,False,"Based on a true story, Martin Scorsese turns GOODFELLAS into an engrossing gangster saga that provides a lot of intense actors with some meaty acting roles--among them, RAY LIOTTA (""I always wanted to be a gangster""), JOE PESCI, ROBERT DeNIRO, LORRAINE BRACCO and PAUL SORVINO.The strong narrative follows the career of a youth, Henry Hill (RAY LIOTTA), an Irish lad living in a neighborhood ruled by the Italian Mafia who wants the easy life of crime and money and fancy cars and life in the fast lane. He enjoys the life of crime until it threatens to jeopardize the security of the life he has as a married man.It's a film very similar in theme to ""The Godfather"", but not quite up to that level of achievement. RAY LIOTTA has never gotten enough credit for his leading role while most of the acting awards went to JOE PESCI as the gun happy hood with an explosive temperament in an Oscar-winning supporting role.If you like this sort of thing, this will be your ticket. Some of the scenes have a strong impact with startling realism as far as the violence goes, and it moves smoothly toward a satisfactory ""crime does not pay"" conclusion. All of the performances are first rate and there's seldom a dull moment thanks to a soundtrack that includes a lot of pop songs of the period."
24703,False,"Watching ""Goodfellas"", you certainly get the feeling that Martin Scorsese had wanted to make this movie for a long time. Thank God that he finally got to; it was probably his best movie up to that time. It shows the mafia world through the eyes of up-and-comer Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) is Henry's main entry point into the mafia, but Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) is also something else. Needless to say, there is a LOT of violence (well duh; this movie's about crime), but none of it gratuitous.You may have heard of Joe Pesci's ""How am I funny?"" speech. Let's just say that you have to see it to believe it. In fact, you have to see the whole movie to believe it. And to get a feeling of Martin Scorsese at his best."
24704,False,"I hate mafia movies But this movie is great. 
Because there is a very good rhythm. It's fast and clear. You can not trust anyone in the Mafia world."
24705,False,"This is one of my all time favorite mobb movies ever. It has it all....Maybe I just connect with mostly anything Martin Scorcese does. If you like Mobb movie you are sure to enjoy this one. ""Looks like Somebody We Know"""
24706,False,"Goodfellas (1990) Mafia showpiece With action, humor, suspense, Great score and soundtrack, Transfixing Steadicam shot We learn: Don't mess with the boss.

24707,False,not many movies makes us feel like we are in the gang party or mafia . but this movie shows you how it works . the biggest mistake of the movie is rhythm specially at the end of movie it makes it slow and slower and that is a kind of boring. but other things like directory and actors are really good
24708,False,"Entertaining story of a mobster/gangster who had a nice run lying, cheating, stealing, and killing and everything else and while in real life this would be considered a life of debauchery and worse but for entertainment sake it captures the viewer's attention courtesy of all the name brand stars performances in this movie with quality direction too. It also has a lot of memorable scenes making it a must own for your collection. I was glued to the film when I first saw it. It is a story well told and Ray Liotta delivers the goods 100%. Fascinating glimpse into the world of degenerates Mafioso type supposedly ""cool"" guys or so they would have you believe. The fact is it is a life of no responsibility and if you listen, a questionable future as the movie reveals. The story that this is based of real life Henry Hill couldn't believe he managed to live as long as he did always expecting to die at any moment. I mean we are all going to die but every moment? I like snacking while watching and this is a fun movie to eat with plus have a tasty drink too. Enjoy the sound track, the different things these guys get into and the satisfying closure at the end. You almost are sorry its over as it approaches the ending."
24709,False,"This movie is held up as one of the great Mafia movies of all time, and for good reason. Over the course of the film, we are the shown the Mafia lifestyle through the eyes of our narrator, Henry Hill. Our other main characters are Tommy DeVito and Jimmy Conway, Henry's mob partners who often show the more gruesome parts of Mafia dealings. Ray Liotta (Henry), Joe Pesci (Tommy), and Jimmy (Robert De Niro) bring in brilliant performances that makes truly invested in these characters and makes them feel more than simply actors within the film.The plot of the film follows Henry through his childhood through to his adult life and his associations with the Mafia. This film does a fantastic job at first sucking the viewer in to the sense that the mafia isn't so bad as we see the mobsters accepting Henry as their own and their seemingly affable nature, which can be seen especially in Jimmy. As Henry grows up however the audience begins to see the more violent and amoral dealings of the Mafia that shatter the image of the romantic life that was presented at the beginning as well as other portrayals of Mafia in the media.Something that also has to be mentioned is Martin Scorsese's use of music and sound within the film. Music within the film helps to both capture the time period of the 50's all the way through to the 70's as well as relate to the situation at hand. It gives the film a good rhythm and pace that makes each scene interesting to watch and flows easily into one another, leaving you on the edge of your seat as it makes the two and a half hour run-time feel short as every minute engrosses you into the reality of the film. Overall, a quintessential film for any fan of Mafia movies or film buffs, as well as one of the best films to introduce you to Scorsese's work."
24710,False,"This move has no plot other than ""watch how these gangsters live"". They're are no character arcs, every character ends the movie exactly as they started. Ray Liotta's character starts the movie wanting to be a gangster, he ends the movie wanting to be a gangster. No lessons are learned, there is no remorse for the violent acts.Yet its still a great movie."
24711,False,"The movie Goodfellas really left a good impression. The story line took me in and everything that happened felt like it was real life, even though I'm not Italian and I don't live in 1990. Since the story happened in real life it is 100% understandable. The action, the romance and the thrill combined give this movie a perfect taste of everything that is supposed to be in an action movie. The life of a gangster is put in the spotlight and is viewed from multiple angles, even from the negative angle. I can recommend this movie to anyone who has interest in action and crime movies. To people who haven't watched a lot of movies from those genres I would recommend to watch Goodfellas as one of your first crime movies. Other movies that are similar to Goodfellas are The Godfather, Paid in Full and Casino. To conclude my review I will sum everything up. The story line intriguing, the actors are superb and the editing is excellent."
24712,False,"RELEASED IN 1990 and directed by Martin Scorsese, ""Goodfellas"" tells the true story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his life through his teen years in the late 50s through his years in the Mob in the 60s-80s, covering his relationships with his wife (Lorraine Bracco), his mistress (Gina Mastrogiacomo), his Boss (Paul Sorvino) and his partners Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) & Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) in the Italian-American crime syndicate in the New York City area.I'm not big on mob movies, but I have to admit that ""Goodfellas"" is consistently entertaining and delivers a potent message on misguided loyalties, greed and the folly of getting involved in organized crime regardless of its ""great perks."" In the long run it ain't worth it. I couldn't wait till the arrogant little POS Tommy (Pesci) bought the farm. The feminine cast is rounded out by Debi Mazar and Welker White. Even Samuel L. Jackson shows up.THE MOVIE RUNS 146 minutes and was shot mostly in the New York City/New Jersey area, but also Chicago & Tampa. WRITERS: Nicholas Pileggi with additional stuff from Scorsese.GRADE: B+"
24713,False,"It's the original, full-length music video. To me, the way Scorsese features the music as a main character truly keeps me coming back year after year. More accurately, it could be seen as the ultimate DJ set. Or visual remix. Taking so many beautiful elements, visually and audibly, and bring all elements together at their most dynamic points. There's a shamanistic quality to that skill. So I can honestly say, I FEEL better, because I use this film in a medicinal way, when I watch it. Quick note, if you haven't seen GF and haven't seen Casino... WATCH GF First. That's all."
24714,False,"Martin Scorsese is brilliant! Goodfellas is one of the best Gangster movies of all time. Each character better than next. Love this movie! It's the good old days when the mob ruled. Liotta and Bracco killed it and Pesci, need I say more....classic Pesci. Scorsese is the only director for a movie like Goodfellas. Unchallenged power, Glamour, De Niro."
24715,False,"If all you ask of a movie is that it is entertaining, that it helps you escape your everyday life and lets you just sit back and enjoy the spectacle then this fits the bill perfectly. It's fast paced, well acted, funny, exciting and full of classic scenes.Harrison Ford is at his best, as is Spielberg. Together they make Indy's race against the Nazis to find the Lost Ark a true classic slice of entertainment. I loved this film as a kid and I still love it now."
24716,False,Goodfellas is not only a great movie but it is hands down the best gangster movie of all time. This was made during a period of time where movies where at their peak and this movie was one of the best of that time. The acting is out of this world and the chemistry between the characters is absolutely believable. The violence is stylish but always adds to the story and Joe Pesci knocks it out of the park as the out of control friend who has some good intentions but doesn't go about them the right way. Great flick!
24717,False,"This is the best movie ever. Do yourself a favor and watch it. You won't be disappointed. There are so many classic scenes and characters. Need I say more. Just look at the high IMDb score with over 700,000 reviews.Enjoy it!This is the best movie ever. Do yourself a favor and watch it. You won't be disappointed. There are so many classic scenes and characters. Need I say more. Just look at the high IMDb score with over 700,000 reviews.Enjoy it!"
24718,False,"In a year that has had a powerful boss 3, The big memory when we talk about Mafia movies of I990 It is ""Goodfellas"", not to mention, following everything that a good movie has to have, ""Goodfellas"" has, and even a temperinho The more, with great performances, great script and precise direction, we are certainly talking about one of the best Mafia movies. Let's talk first about the film script that tells the story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a boy who always wanted to be a gangster, here we have a complete narrative of his life, from the rise to the fall, through his dramas, love, death , Disagreements and glare. We do not have here a highly organized Italian mafia, our characters are not the ""Bosses"", quite the contrary, their criminal life begins with robberies and ends with traffic, their operations are well explained, such as the development of all characters, even characters Like that of Paulie who has little screen time are well developed. The photograph of the film is good, it is not memorable, but it knows how to play colors very well on screen, we do not have that dark palette as it is usually the mafia movies, here the color palette is warm, the warm weather is always present and the trail Sound is spectacular, nothing original tracks, only songs from the time when the film is passing, that passes all that sarcastic climate is counterpoint to what is being shown on screen, it is also worth mentioning the great editing and sound mixing Of the film. Joe pesci is one of the best supporting actors in the cinema, and he is completely incredible, and it's good that Scorsese did not manage to play the leading role for De niro - who does a sober and convincing performance - but for Ray Liotta, That in certain moments is even alien to the personage, but in the great part of the film delivers a mafioso very cunning, intelligent and even unconcerned with the world and its consequences. At the end of the day we have a movie that keeps its rhythm and the high level in all the acts, it is not completely perfect and not a masterpiece of the seventh art, but surely it is a spectacular movie."
24719,False,"Anyone who is hesitating to see this movie, should don't wait another second and start watching it. I enjoyed every second of this masterpiece and I believe it has a strong message for us all.Everything, from acting (of course) to screen quality is perfect. Some may say that the mafia movies are now clichés and are becoming boring. Not only I don't believe that statement is true, but also Goodfellas can not be described as ""just another gangster movie"". The only ""con"" I found about this one is the ending. I think it was too simple and quick, I waited something better to be honest. But that doesn't stop the movie getting a 9 from me!TL;DR: MUST WATCH."
24720,False,"There's much to say about Goodfellas, and most of it has already been said by others. What I enjoyed the most with the movie was how it constructs this dual reality. You see and hear all of these guys having a blast, enjoying their money and their power. You can hear Liotta's character describing the joys of the life they led. At the same time you are presented with certain scenes from this life where you can also see the backside of the medal. Many mob movies are like this. They show this really charming culture of, well, people celebrating their own importance, and a culture based on respect, tradition and hierarchy. But then you typically see it all falls apart, so it wasn't a good idea after all. This movie plays around a bit with this, showing you both sides of the medal from the get go, but as the story progresses you can gradually see the medal turning around, going from having the positive side in focus, to having the negative side in focus. But, as mentioned, both sides of the medal are visible from the start till the end. This is maybe the most obvious in the ending scenes, with how the narration relates to what you see."
24721,False,"This movie has one of the best ""oners"" which you may or may not ever notice. I had to re- watch it several times before i noticed the little loopty loop. Besides the Godfather, this is one of the all time best ""mafia"" movies. The Cinematography in this film is like no other. The acting is spot on from interviews and other video i have seen of the actual people the actors are portraying. I can rematch this movie over and over and it is still one of my favorites. I suggest getting the movie on Blu Ray and watching any extending version or extras you can. A lot to this film so you should watch it a few times to pick up on all the details."
24722,False,"Martin Scorsese's films are a movie historian creating his perfect movies. Unlike Quentin Tarantino who simply adapts his films to what he thinks would effect him the most if he was just an audience member. One of the original bad boys of cinema creates absolutely sweltering narratives that makes the filmmakers brilliant storyteller. With a editing style that is more like a long montage, then a feature film. The inner-monologue he uses, and has used in Wolf of Wall Street, The Departed, Gangs of New York makes utter sense in telling these confessions of... stories that are familiarizing the life of a mob with an audience who are not familiar with stashing dead rats in ice boxes or being a made men. Its almost genius. The more you watch - the more familiar it gets - the more funny it gets. By the end, even the nastiest moment is hilarious. I don't see Goodfellas as his best film, maybe for some of the outstanding cast, but it has stuck in a stigma to the average movie goer for the longest time. And it will eventually be his most revered and appreciated Crime film in decades to come. Like Orsen Welles' Third Man or Kubrick's Space Odyssey; it will overpass his other filmography. Its an entertaining film, funny as Wolf of Wall Street, while as thrilling as Cape Fear."
24723,False,"Wow. Has there ever been a better use of two and a half hours on any role of film? Some may argue for Pulp Fiction, but in my opinion, this is better. You've got two Scorsese regulars (De Niro and Pesci) and Ray Liotta. This is quite possibly the greatest movie trio EVER. Not only did this film host superb cinematography, acting, directing, writing, improv and casting, but it made these three actors quintessential mobsters. Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of all time. I'd be willing to argue that it is his greatest achievement. The signature Scorsese violence and drugs with his classic mobster themes and you've got yourself a two and a half hour tour de force that deserves multiple viewings and the highest order of critical acclaim that can be awarded. Goodfellas is the greatest mob movie of all time."
24724,False,"One of my ""all time"" favorite movies. Martin Scorsese did not win the Oscar for Best Director in 1991, the Academy preferred Kevin Costner for the kitsch ""Dances with Wolves""! ""Goodfellas"" is one of those amazing art pieces where everything is perfect. Joe Pesci's character is iconic, the soundtrack is unexpected and effective, the way the story is told through the eyes of the camera is amazing (replicating the dominant spirit of the scene or each part of the narrative's main character).If you have not seen this movie, do it immediately. It's one of those movie masterpieces that deserve to stand next to ""Citizen Kane"", ""Броненосец Потёмкин"" (""Battleship Potemkin"") or ""Ladri di biciclette"" (""Bicycle Thieves""). For me it is one of the most well-told stories of the seventh art history, its apparent simplicity was born from the mind of his director."
24725,False,"Classic gangster flick adapted from co-screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi's 1987 non-fiction book WISEGUY about Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his friends working their way up through the Lucchese crime family, and the benefits and consequences that await them. After all these years, it's still all around excellent. Truthfully, it breaks the show-don't-tell rule several times, what with iconic scenes and a flawless soundtrack getting drowned out by voice-over way too frequently; but, hey, if someone were to ever reinvent the wheel, it's only right that it'd be Scorsese.***½ (out of four)"
24726,False,"I actually was motivated to refinish an old $5 shoe shine box I found at the local good will in honor of this movie for fun. It reminded me of my late grandfather & to have a little fun with it I decided to finished it with good fellas feel. Here are the before & after pictures. I enjoy a project now & then but I'm not a hands on guy for a living, either way I think it came out pretty good.

24727,False,"Goodfellas is definitely one of the best gangster movies I have ever seen. Martin Scorsese directed this film perfectly with a pistol whipping cast. This film is based on a true story about Henry Hill, and how he strives from a kid to an adult to be a gangster in the life of the Italian mafia. The film is set between 1955 and the late 1970's in East New York, Brooklyn. The cast is filled with some of the biggest stars of the early nineties. Including Ray Liotta, who played the main character Henry Hill. Along with Robert De Niro as Jimmy Conway, also known as Jimmy ""the gem"", and Joe Pesci who played Tommy DeVito. These actors do an outstanding job on screen of portraying the classic gangster theme. I could not be distracted throughout watching this film. It literally sucked me into the story. Martin Scorsese did an outstanding job with the cast, production, music, and the story of the gangster life in New York. Henry Hill wanted to be a gangster since he was a kid. Watching the gangsters around the neighborhood, he desired more and more to be like them. He was intrigued from the start and wanted a life of no limits. Henry, Jimmy, and Tommy were a great trio of hardcore gangsters who demanded respect and didn't take crap from anyone. The film is full of countless gangsters with a great script and superb music and sound. The soundtrack really pulled me into the era of the 60's and 70's. The costumes and clothes were done very well. The costume and makeup design mirrored the era very well. The film also had a great amount of gangster crime and violence that kept my attention the whole time. The lighting in the film was mostly dark. Some of these scenes were in a club and bars so it matched perfectly for a gangster setting. Scorsese also did well during a scene where the trio was digging up an old friend and the lighting was dark and foggy. The lighting in this scene also had a red tint to it. Another great scene was a classic slow motion up close shooting by tommy DeVito. You can see each empty shell fly out of the pistol in slow motion. The communication of the brutal violence of the mafia was well received. Overall, the film had every element of the gangster life. The film told the story very well and kept me entertained as much as when I was watching The Godfather. Both are classic gangster films that will never be forgotten for years to come."
24728,False,"Goodfellas has a solid case of being Scorsese's finest work, and considering his iconic filmography, that's a huge ask.It not only offers career-defining performances from Liotta and Pesci, it also gave us the ultimate De Niro hardcore gangster, the stuff his legend is made of. With Scorsese in scintillating form, the famous restaurant one-shot is one of many intoxicating scenes, we get an epic story spanning decades, and most importantly for such a genre film, it's absolutely coherent.Italio/Latino-Gangster movies often exist within themselves, and while Goodfellas doesn't transcend its genre as a work of art (like Coppolas' Godfather 1/2 arguably does) it's so expertly-executed that it must sit right at the top of this particular genre-tree."
24729,False,"Goodfellas is easily one of the greatest movies of all time. Hands down, it is one of the few movies that has left a long lasting impression, one that will always be memorable. Martin Scorsese is definitely on top of his game and Goodfellas has definitely cemented a spot in his impressive resume, along with Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Casino, The Departed, and The Wolf of Wall Street. It's not hard to see why Goodfellas is such a critically acclaimed movie and still a very popular movie amongst film fans.Based on the non-fiction novel Wise Guy by Nicholas Pileggi (who also wrote the screenplay along with Martin Scorsese, Goodfellas tells the story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta who puts in an explosive performance in his best role to date) and his rise and fall in his career with the mafia throughout the 1950's and the 1980's. He starts off as a young boy running errands and as time goes on, he earns his reputation as a feared gangster however such acts including adultery, murder, and drug use contribute to his downfall. His fellow friends and gangsters throughout his time in the mafia include his childhood friend the sociopath Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci who deservedly won the 1990 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor) and the slick, calculating and volatile Jimmy Conway who also enjoys hijacking and robbing trucks (Robert De Niro in another memorable performance). The mob boss is Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino), a man who commands respect and fear, and rules over the crime family with an iron first including Henry Hill, Tommy DeVito and Jimmy Conway. Henry Hill's wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco, well known as the psychologist Dr Jennifer Melfi from The Sopranos) finds herself seduced by her husband's glamorous lifestyle but nothing lasts forever when Henry's criminal activities and behaviour impede into their personal lives.Without question this is Martin Scorsese's finest movie. There's not one bad thing that can be said about this movie. The cast is first rate, the entire story and screenplay is excellent, and Martin Scorsese as the director does a very commendable job. Throughout the entire 146 minutes, there is not a dull moment nor is there a minute wasted. There are endless classic scenes in Goodfellas that I could not even start to list them. The clever use of the soundtrack with all the songs intertwined with many scenes from the movie makes Goodfellas even more memorable at another level. Every time I hear the piano exit from Layla by Derek and The Dominos, I am instantly reminded of Goodfellas.Goodfellas is a movie with a reputation for being violent with 300 uses of the f... word. In no way does Martin Scorsese pull any punches, nor does he aim to glamorise life in the mafia or the criminal lifestyle. The violence is realistic, cold, and unflinching, and this is certainly not a movie for everyone.Unfortunately Goodfellas was unfairly robbed of many Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director among others. Though Martin Scorsese finally earns a long overdue Academy Award for The Departed in 2006, he deserved to win Best Director for Goodfellas.Goodfellas earns its spot as one of the finest movies of all time, and is definitely one of my favourite movies that will never soon be forgotten.A well deserved 10/10"
24730,False,"Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, Paul Sorvino, Lorraine Bracco... No need to elaborate any further... Great movie inspired by the life of Henry Hill. Great story told by one of the best film makers is history of a young kid who grew up surrounded by mobsters, crocks & thieves...or as they called them back then... Goodfellas. De Niro's portrayal of James Conway or James Burke in real life, although been toned down by much, is absolutely genius. It is important to note that although Henry Hill was in the mafia he was only the associate, as ""made men"" (full time mafioso) could be only those who are, or can be proved to be of Sicilian origin. I would like to mention a phenomenal Joe Pesci performance playing Tommy DeVito or Thomas DeSimone is real life, who was also a Lucchese crime family associate, much like Henry Hill. Don't want to go into the detail as this movie really doesn't need any introduction, just go a head and see it for your self!"
24731,False,"Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is without question one of the finest gangster movies ever made, a benchmark even. It's that rare occasion for a genre film of this type where everything artistically comes together as one. Direction, script, editing, photography, driving soundtrack and crucially an ensemble cast firing on all cylinders. It's grade ""A"" film making that marked a return to form for Scorsese whilst simultaneously showing the director at the summit of his directing abilities.The story itself, based on Nicholas Pileggi's non-fiction book Wiseguy, pulls absolutely no punches in its stark realisation of the Mafia lifestyle. It's often brutal, yet funny, unflinching yet stylish, but ultimately from first frame to last it holds the attention, toying with all the human emotions during the journey, tingling the senses of those who were by 1990 fed up of popcorn movie fodder.It's not romanticism here, if anything it's a debunking of the Mafia myth, but even as the blood flows and the dialogue crackles with electricity, it always remains icy cool, brought to us by a man who had is eyes and ears open while growing up in Queens, New York in the 40s and 50s. Eccellente! 9/10"
24732,False,"Ever since I watched this film when I was younger with my father it has always stuck with me and remained on my favorites list, that has to mean something. This film has and will continue to pass the test of time and will always be remembered as an all time great. Martin Scorsese is probably the definite best at making mafia movies and this might be his masterpiece. The film just seems to tell the story in such a unique and interesting way which continues to be used as a Scorsese device and to me never fails.I highly doubt this review will ever be read due to the numerous other reviews that praise this film but I figured I may as well right a quick and short review on one of my all time favorites."
24733,False,"This a brilliant and well casted film directed by Martin Scorsese. This is one of the films that for me are timeless especially because it's a true story. It is a classic Mob, gangster movie but portrayed in a different way. Every Mob movie was made the same after the God Father was made and this film stayed true to the plot and essence of the movie with new spin added to it. It has the violence, action and comedy. This is a film based on a true story focused around the main characters name Henry Hill played by Ray Liotta, James ""Jimmy"" Conway played by Robert De Niro and Tommy DeVito played by Joe Pesci. Henry and Tommy met as kids running numbers and a cigarette racket for the local Mob family and Jimmy. Henry and Jimmy could never fully be in the Mob as they we not full blooded Italians. So a lot of their security and opportunities came from Tommy who is full blooded Italian. As quickly as they rose to money and power it quickly went it way to do poor choices and loyalty.This movie has your typical Mob style themes or plots. Henry is kid that comes from a good family and hardworking farther, but the street life of gangsters with nice clothes money and women is what attacked him and he felt like that was the life to live. Once he begins to affiliate himself with the family he enjoys the success of the money and respect and meets his future wife name Karen Hill played by Lorraine Bracco. She too quickly become comfortable and use to the life of the family. Getting thousands of dollars and not asking where it came from. Buying whatever she wanted with no question or worried about the prices, all the way down to the cops making regular visits to her house looking for anything criminal to build a case against Henry or any member of the family.Jimmy is older than Henry and Tommy and has been in the life for a while. He is really the master mind of the crew. Nothing really gets down with his approval. He was like their mentor into the life crime and the life of the family. Every job they do is done his way and with no remorse. He has a simple method anyone that can get them caught or could stand in his way they ended up dead. Tommy is the wild fire cracker of the group. He had a temper worse than Jimmy. You never can tell when Tommy is joking or serious. His temper is so bad that in parts of the movie you can see that Henry was scared of him even though they were child hood friends that grew up together. The best depiction of that is the scene when Tommy is telling a joking and Henry is laughing and Tommy ask what is so funny and Henry says the joke and Tommy with a serious tone ask what am I a funny guy do I amuse you and at the same time pulls a gun out. Henry gets scared and then Tommy starts laughing and says he is only joking. Tommy does what he wants because he wants to and doesn't think about consequence."
24734,False,"saw this in the movies in 1990...as I walked back, up the aisle, and to my 1986 Mazda 626, little did I realize it would be the most watched movie of my movie-watching career.the detail, the detail...the butter between slices of Italian bread within reach of the fellas, as they stop off at Pesci's Moms' house to pick up a knife..and wind up picking up 3 pounds as Scorsese's real life mom talks them into a very early breakfast and then provides a floor show: the worst ""religious art"" imaginable....you saw the scene (500 times).no complaints..but I will mention that Lorraine Bracco was robbed of frame-time, in my opinion. also...perhaps the soundtrack was a little top heavy with loud hit records, from time to time.buy it..all editions..the ""bulls"" will never know."
24735,False,"This is one of the best film in history with so much accurate gang history. It is enjoyable With stunning acting and character which look like real gangster. The directing of Martin Scorsese's is great. He is one of the great director in history and I love almost is film. The gangster look alike same to our country they have no problem of doing against law. That,s why I love it. It is purely accurate and the film script is awesome almost every dialogue is good. It is better than Godfather and also funny. Not the all film is serious and real wise guy are shown and their work. It is the biography of Henry Hill well most of the film. It has brutal violence which the psycho people of gangster do. The human nature is shown how worst a human can became when extreme measurement is done A master piece of Gangster film."
24736,False,"Yes it's overrated, but to me, this is my favorite crime film (with the Godfather and others following it).This movie has amazing acting done by Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta and especially Joe Pesci whose role made him an Oscar. The actors done great portraying the role of their real life gangster characters. A great milestone for all these actors, bravo! Goodfellas also features a nostalgic soundtrack of old classics. After about 24 years, this movie has not aged a bit and is still enjoyable 'till now which is a landmark for Martin Scorsese making him one of the most iconic directors of all time.The memorable quotes also set the tone for the movie. It's like you can't live your life without memorizing at least one line from Goodfellas. IMO this movie is all in all wonderful, stunning,a landmark for pop culture and is as great as the Godfather!"
24737,False,"The greatest Gangster film that I have seen, it does something that even The Godfather, did not do.Here is a film on organized crime that is having a voice over of it's protagonist for good amount of time and it makes the film all the more interesting. I love many shots in the film, like the conversation shots between Paulie and Henry, or the way jokes of Joe Pesci are captured or even the murders. Damn, this is all very realistic and it's admirable to have achieved it this way. Indeed at times it plays like a documentary unlike a fiction film. Also, the film is told in first person not only by Henry but also by his wife Karen. Damn, it makes the film reliable and real.The performances are superb, each detail, each nuance is done well, nothing seems out of place, a jaw dropping murder of rib tickling joke, all seem so natural in emotions here. Joe Pesci gets out some wonderful lines. Robert DeNiro is extremely cold blooded as Jimmy. Paul Sorvino as Paulie is authoritative. Loranne Bracco as Karen is loving. Ray Liotta as Henry is infectious and fragile. There is a host of other characters that are wonderful too. We must understand that these characters actually existed in reality and from their interviews was the book, Wise Gy written by Nicolas Pilleggi. GoodFellas was based on this book only. Scorsese is indeed the most interesting director of our times, who takes varied themes and puts it all in the pan and cooks it so well that the dish surely tastes delicious.To showcase power, he takes an interesting point where Henry takes his Karen into a restaurant by surpassing the crowd, going through the back door and a table is literally lifted and placed for them. To showcase guilt, Scorsese uses conversation between Jimmy and Henry. To showcase crime, he shows us just a few gunshots and how emotionless the killer is. Damn, all this makes it such interesting and a fun film. The camera movement is adept and so is the cinematographer. But to dive the camera and the cameraman, the director is needed. Scorsese precisely is such director. This is not actually a Gangster film, I will rather call it as a film that is made on Organised Crime in a throughly interesting way and with eccentric and interesting characters. Of course, the cast does get all the chords right and takes the characters into a new level.It is indeed long with a length of 140 minutes, but it's an easy film for a movie buff. But for the non-aficionados the characters names and the length may take a toll. But I will say, most film-goers have considered this a good film as per ratings all over, thus even the claim that it is lengthy can be cut off. I am giving 5/5 for this wonderful film, that is self indulgent at times, but the best part is that it indulges you as viewer. Kudos to the master Scorsese for this."
24738,False,"First off I have to say that I am a huge fan of Martin Scorsese and I think he is one of the best directors out there. So when it comes to viewing his films I am expecting a lot. I am also a big fan of the gangster genre as well. I didn't see this film when it was first released, in fact I didn't see it until a few years back. I am a film student so I was constantly bombarded by teachers and classmates as well to view this film. I was not disappointed at all. I thought the dialogue was well written, even though that persisted of Joe Pesci yelling out the f word every few seconds. The score and soundtrack were amazing as well. I really enjoyed Ray Liotta's performance because I am so used to seeing him portray the villain in films nowadays, even though he has so much talent and I would love to see him in another great role like this one. Robert De Niro was brilliant as usual, bringing his A game once again. The direction was superb and once again I was impressed with Scorsese's vision of film. To me, this film is one of the greatest ever made and still stands the test of time."
24739,False,"""Goodfellas"" is a movie in which we can see how the things work from the inside of the ""family"" in the mafia. I can compare this movie with the movie ""The Godfather"", ""Goodfellas"" is the only movie which can compared with the epic movie of ""The Godfather"". I said that to make you understand how important is this and how good this movie is.In this movie I can tell you that Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito (won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role in 1991) and Ray Liotta as Henry Hill made their best interpretations and about Robert De Niro as James Conway I can tell you that I could not expect nothing less from him. I also liked the interpretation of Paul Sorvino as Paul Cicero.Finally about Martin Scorsese what can I tell, he made an excellent movie which has written history. Martin Scorsese nominated for Oscar for Best Director in 1991 and in my opinion he ought to have taken it. The Screenplay and the Writing were really good as was also highlighted from the nomination for Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium."
24740,False,"Goodfellas is an excellent,flawless Masterpiece and a Classic and it's not only one of the greatest Gangster Films ever made and one of the greatest films of the 90's but also one of the greatest films ever made. Filled with masterful direction,excellent performances and a great soundtrack,Goodfellas is one of my all time favorite films and is Martin Scorsese and cinema at it's best.Set in New York,based on the true life book Wiseguy by Nicolas Pileggi and based on a true story,Goodfellas tells the story of Henry Hill(Ray Liotta)an Irish-Italian man who has had a love for Gangsters and gangster life since he was a teenager in his local neighborhood. As a youngster Henry starts working for the Mob and as a he gets older Henry becomes apart of the Mob and living the lifestyle of a gangster. Over the course of three decades Henry Hill along with his friends Jimmy The Gent Conway(Robert De Niro)and Tommy DeVito(Joe Pesci)depicts Henry's easy rise in the Mob and his hard and dangerous downfall.Right from the opening credits and all the way to the very end Goodfellas is a flawless masterwork of a film that pulls you end and does not let go until the final frame. Martin Scorsese has created a film that right next to Francis Coppola's The Godfather as the definitive Gangster film. But where as The Godfather was an epic and somewhat romantic view of gangster like and a Mob family,Goodfellas took a much different direction and gives viewers a darker,less romantic view of Mob showing viewers a world of how a Mobster lives his life as a gangster. What is different about Goodfellas is that the story tells the story from the point of view of the gangsters who works is not a Mob Boss or someone who runs a crime family but someone who works under the Mob bosses. One of the things I love about the film Goodfellas is the way Scorsese plays with the audience showing things from Henry Hill's point of view where from Hill's point of view the Mob is a great way of living and a easy way to make money and live the good life showing the glamour,suits and cars making audiences love the lifestyle. But Scorsese tricks audiences and shows us that Gangster and Mob life can be a dangerous and violent way of living where you can either be killed or sent to prison. Scorsese gives the film a since of dread where there is violence in the air and that being in the Mob is not all it's cracked up to be. Some Films based on true stories while good are most of the time told in a straight forward fashion and if Goodfellas had been in the hands of another filmmaker it would have been more of a straight forward true story but Scorsese being the master filmmaker that he is fills the film with great scenes and moments that are iconic and memorable and Scorsese keeps you glued to the screen engrossed by the film and making you want more making Goodfellas one of the greatest true stories on film. The screenplay by Scorsese and Pileggi is impressive giving the film excellent dialog and scenes with great realism and edge making you as the viewer feel like you are in the scenes with the characters. Goodfellas is one of the fastest 2 and a half hours you will ever go through because when the film starts it never slows down and let's you breath a sigh of relief. The pace is so rapid and quick you will feel like you are watching a 90 minute film rather than a two and a half hour one. I think it's because of the documentary and raw feel of the film and how we as the viewer are in the movie. Goodfellas is like a Rock N'Roll record put on film where you are looking and listening. The main characters in the film are not what you would call likable,but are well-developed and there is times when you can relate to them and you see things from their point of view and you get pulled into their state of minds. The ending and final 20-30 minutes is a classic ending filled with suspense and paranoia that is pushed to the max. It's an ending you will not forget.The cast does excellent jobs in their roles. Ray Liotta is amazing in his career defining role as Henry Hill,with Liotta bringing intensity and wild energy to the role. Robert De Niro is excellent and at his best as Jimmy Conway,with De Niro being menacing and unforgettable. Joe Pesci is brilliant in his Oscar winning role as the volatile Tommy DeVito,with Pesci being scary,intense and funny at the same time. Lorraine Bracco is riveting as Karen Hill,Henry's wife. Bracco has great chemistry with Liotta. Paul Sorvino is captivating and suave as Paulie,the boss over everybody. Frank Vincent is wonderful as Billy Batts,a made guy from Tommy's past. Frank Sivero(Frankie Carbone),Chuck Low(Morris),Michael Imperioli(Spider),Debi Mazer(Sandy),Gina Mastrogiacomo(Janice)and Catherine Scorsese(Tommy's Mother)give good performances as well. Also lookout for an early role by Samuel L. Jackson in the role of Stacks.The direction by Martin Scorsese is masterful and brilliant,with Scorsese always moving the camera and giving the film a great pace and visual style. Great direction by Scorsese.The soundtrack in the film is one of best soundtracks in movie history with classics by The Rolling Stones(Gimmie Shelter,Monkey Man),Donovan(Atlantis),The Crystels(Then He Kissed Me),Cream(Sunshine Of Your Love),The Who(Magic Bus),Harry Nilsson(Jump Into The Fire),Sid Vicious(My Way),Bobby Darin(Beyond The Sea),Aretha Franklin(Baby I Love you),Eric Clapton,Derek and The Dominoes(Layla,Piano Exit),George Harrison(What Is Life)and more. Excellent soundtrack.In final word,if you love Martin Scorsese,Gangster films,Crime Dramas or films in general,I highly suggest you see Goodfellas,a timeless Masterpiece and Classic that you can watch again and again and should be in every film lover's collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
24741,False,"""GoodFellas"" is simply (after ""The GodFather"") the best-mafia gangster film ever made, and this is very clear in this movie.The story begins with Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a young Irish living in the suburbs of New York with his family, and suddenly finds himself involved with the Italian Mafia, and after some work and be arrested for the first time, he is finally integrated into the mob-family. Years pass and the life of Henry is now on the mob-business, a little work there, a robbery there, always with their best friends and partners James (Robert De Niro) and Tommy (Joe Pesci).As the story progresses, Martin Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi (screenplay) explore the world mobster in an impressive way. It's almost watching a lesson in how to be a professional criminal. Always keeping a realistic pace, and that little black humor that always Scorsese uses in his films, achieving the film both interesting and pure entertainment.The entire cast does an excellent job, Robert De Niro despite not appear much, manages to be great; Ray Liotta is also excellent, but who gives a fantastic performance throughout the film is undoubtedly Joe Pesci.From beginning to end we see the Mafia as never before, while maintaining an impressive pace of entertainment, very well written and directed, ""GoodFellas"" is surely one of the best works of Scorsese to be remembered."
24742,False,"Goodfellas is a fantastic movie with a great story line and a truly inspired cast,Joe Pesci performance is fantastic and he completely deserved the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.There was really only two problems I had with the movie,I didn't like how they put Robert De Niro's name before Ray Liotta's in the credits and even on the posters he is in front,this is making you think that James Conway is the main character,but thats not true,Henry Hill is,and although I obviously prefer Robert De Niro to Ray Liotta,he is the main character,and no one will know that going into the movie.I also don't like how they changed the narration to Lorraine Bracco's character,because Henry Hill is narrating,and it doesn't make any sense to change to another character,Forrest Gump doesn't go from Tom Hanks narrating,and suddenly jump to Robin Wright.Going through the life of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) who narrates his life,starting as a young man wanting to be part of the mafia,to being part of it and quickly regretting it."
24743,False,"One of the finest films in history, Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is a true phenomenon and stands out as the leading film in the gangster movie genre.The film tells the story of the life of mobster, Henry Hill, portrayed by Ray Liotta, and his and his fellow ""wiseguys"" Jimmy(Robert De Niro), Tommy(Joe Pesci) and boss Paulie(Paul Sorvino). The casting for the film is absolutely spot on,as every character is played with complete conviction and credibility. Everyone in the film has insecurities and conflicting emotions shown throughout, and whats amazing about these characters is how their personalities lead them into dissolution. Despite how disturbing these mobsters are, the maniacal and unpredictable Joe Pesci especially, there is something likable about them, and even as Liotta's character slowly goes from rise to fall into a life of excessive drug abuse, it still feels as if he is the protagonist in the film.Another actor deserving a mention for a brilliant performance in the film is Lorraine Bracco, who plays Karen, Henry's first wife, from first meeting her character when she goes out with a reluctant Henry, you wouldn't believe throughout all the troubles she sticks by Henry and eventually succumbs to his lifestyle, as quoted ""it turns her on"".The sense of family in the mob is ever present in the film, with Paulie acting as a father figure for Henry, who is inspired by Jimmy and Tommy, and the three embark down a violent road of crime, from robberies to murder, meanwhile getting married and having children.Another brilliant feature of the film is the soundtrack, a brilliant selection of songs spanning over twenty years that set the scenes. From Tony Bennett's ""Rags To Riches"" to Derek and The Dominoes' ""Layla"", each song is combined perfectly to comment on the actions in the film.The screenplay for the movie, based on Nicolas Pileggi's book ""Wiseguy"" is completely flawless, gripping and intense throughout, keeping the audience fixated on how the characters are going to respond or take action next.Personally, for me this is Martin Scorsese's best film and one of my favourite films, it captures the life of this young boy turned gangster perfectly with iconic scenes again and again, making it a memorable spectacle to watch."
24744,False,"Goodfellas is one of the best mafia films you'll ever been blessed to see in your lifetime, right down to the letter in terms of acting, directing, but especially scripting. I have this fantastic script in book form, where the film honors the script one hundred percent. Goodfellas is quite a scary movie in terms of it's character's attributes, the main one being Pesci's, his Tommy, played with such a haunting ferocity. This is the most scary performance I've seen in a mafia film. He makes the character he played in Casino, Nicky Santori, look tame, although the the two bare some resemblances, especially in the violence and recklessness department. The story is told through the eyes of mafia figure, Henry Hill, played superbly by Ray Liotta, his most notable performance, when the mentioning of this actor's name comes up. Hill who died a while back, had described the mafia as a dark and terrifying world as seen through this brilliant film. It's through his eyes we meet these characters, like Jimmy the Gent, Conway, De Niro excelling himself again, and also Paul Sorvino as Paulie Cicero, a Sicilian godfather less threatening cause of his laid back manner, but looks can be deceiving. We move through Henry's wannabe mafia type, from childhood, that had him skipping school, subjecting him to a whacking from his father here and there, right through to his two incarcerations, where after getting out of the second one, thanks to his mother in law who puts up bail, he is soon making a deal of immunity. Reasons. One, his wife (Bracco) who goes to see Deniro is pointed towards this alley where all these coats are hanging. Should she go in there? No, why? Cause she'll probably get whacked. She options to quickly take off instead. To me, this was the most terrifying moment in this near two and a half hour film. Two, the other reason, Deniro asks Liotta to whack a guy down in Miami, and knows that if he accepts this, he won't came back alive. Death is shown so cheaply here, where if you don't do the right thing, the probability of living is null. One of the hoods, Stax, played by Samuel L Jackson in one of it's memorable bloody scenes, is one such an example, where a montage of other victims follow. Goodfellas has some real bloody moments, one involving a connected guy who's celebrating, getting out, on Henry's Hill's actual birthday, where his mouth earns him a helluva of a bashing, followed by a freshly dug grave. When it comes to violence, this movie is uncompromising, but these thugs existed. Again at Goodfellas's end, as to Hill's living arrangements, once more we see that crime just doesn't pay, but it pays bloody well to seen this 1990 classic."
24745,False,"It is a great Movie that can have you believing what you saw was not what you saw. It is the genius of Advertising and The Con. Contrary to popular belief this is not a glamorization of The Mob or their lifestyle, in fact, it is just the opposite. No matter how much the narrator/main Character tells us how attractive it is and how desirable it is to be a Wiseguy, the Film denies this in almost every scene.It is the rhythm, the staccato of it all that hypnotizes us into believing what he is saying, but not what is actually occurring. The pulsating Music Soundtrack and the uncanny mesmerizing voice over lulls the Audience into a false sense of a wanting place. It is the work of the Devil. Or at least a devilishly good Film-Maker. There is nothing attractive here. The People are ugly and unpleasant and constantly do ugly and unpleasant things. The Sets are mundane, gaudy and unattractive, as are the clothes. There is not one appealing aspect to any of this Photo-Play. Yet, Audiences are led by this pied piper Scorsese into the rat-a-tat-tat ruminations of a heel and a turncoat and they actually care about this crumb.Such is the magical work of a Movie Maker obsessed with style that cannot be denied His Craft. This is a fugazi. A manipulative Movie. A sinful master work that is a temptation worthy of a great deceiver."
24746,False,"These are among the first words spoken by Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) in Martin Scorsese's modern classic ""GoodFellas"". The film chronicles Hill's career in the mob through 25 turbulent years that see him living the high life for a while until the occupational hazards of a life of crime start to catch up with him.The story is based on the book ""Wiseguy"" by Nicholas Pileggi, who also wrote the book upon which ""Casino"" was based. We're invited into the underworld of crime by a narrator who invests the story with credibility. Although glamorous at times, the movie pulls no punches when it comes to violence. Such is as it should be, in the interests of authenticity.The cast leaves little to be desired. Ray Liotta was a relative newcomer at the time but his portrayal of Henry Hill is so engaging that it makes it easy to root for the bad guys. Robert De Niro & Joe Pesci, who previously teamed up to great effect in Scorsese's ""Raging Bull"", shared the screen again here. Pesci of course went on to win the Oscar for his downright frightening portrayal of volatile gangster Tommy DeVito, while De Niro's performance was more understated but no less impressive. Lorraine Bracco was a bit of a weak link in my opinion but she did garner some attention for her performance at the time. Beyond the stars, Frank Vincent & Paul Sorvino are especially memorable while a handful of others also make an impression with the limited amount of screen time they have to work with.In technical terms, ""GoodFellas"" is practically flawless. Scorsese's direction is impeccable and his employment of popular music shows great taste and ingenuity. The cinematography of Michael Ballhaus is always attractive and the film was expertly assembled by Scorsese's longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker. The sets and costume design also deserve high praise for authenticity.Ultimately, ""GoodFellas"" certainly must rank as one of the greatest gangster movies of all time. There are countless memorable sights and sounds contained within the film's 146 minutes. That being said, I don't think it's quite as good as ""The Godfather"" due to some minor imperfections. Still, it's a must for any discerning movie fan."
24747,False,"Goodfellas is arguably Martin Scorsese's highest acclaimed and highest rated film. Based on the true story of Henry Hill, Goodfellas follows Henry Hill played by Ray Liotta and his friends, James Conway (Di Nero) and Tommy DeVito (Pesci), as they rise and inevitable fall in the mob hierarchy.The film is brilliant, it is full of insanely well-written characters, wit and funny dialog, great acting, great directing and in general great writing. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, especially the last half an hour or so, and the acting was brilliant. Joe Pesci won an Oscar for his portrayal of the insane, crazy psycho who could kill within a minute if you looked at him funny.This film really shows Martin Scorsese's directing skills and Liotta's acting skills who somehow didn't get nominated for an Oscar or who hasn't been in as many good films as you would expect. The film is the perfect length and the end stays with you forever. It also has some great lines.The music was brilliantly placed and was, itself, brilliant. It's probably regarded as Scorsese's best and I'd have to disagree. Taxi Driver is better but this would be a close second. The film gives a proper perspective from the ""bad guys"" point of view and really just doesn't give a crap about what it says or how it portrays it. It just does. It's one of the best films ever created and everyone should see it. Amazing."
24748,False,"This is my first review on IMDb and i am starting with Goodfellas!,for all the good reasons. I had watched it once couple of years ago, but may be I was not mature enough as a critic. Now, last year I watched it again, and then it began - every week almost tens of times I went over and over it again, simultaneously reading about the legends behind it - Scorsose and De Niro. Goodfellas does all that it intends to. It takes a deep dive into the lives of those we wince or frown at, and before the movie ends, you have already developed a bond with them, you know them! and you do not feel very sad about it being a true story. Narration by Henry Hill takes you along with the story, with no mystery to solve - just listen, watch and relish their story of lives. The dialogues, howsoever simple they are, resonate in your mind forever (""It was like the Police department for wise guys!"", ""What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Are you playing f#$&ing wise guy with me? What did I tell you?"" "" For me, it is the best Mafia movie, with redoubtable performances by Joe Pesci, Robet De Niro and all others."
24749,False,"Considered as one of Martin Scorsese's timeless classics, ""Goodfellas"" is probably one of the greatest films to ever be made. Based on the true memoir of the Lucchese crime family, later turned into an book entitled ""Wiseguy"", by Nicholas Pileggi, ""Goodfellas"" shows the memoir of Henry Hill, and his association with his infamous crime family, as they go through the rises and falls of their lives. In a terrific all-star cast, Scorsese has gathered some of the biggest names in movies from Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Paul Sorvino, Lorraine Bracco, and Joe Pesci, all delivering one memorable performance after the other. Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco, however, steal most of the screen time, both delivering respective performances, and they know how to show their stuff. Although delivered limited screen time, Robert De Niro and Paul Sorvino delivered memorable performances, revealing how they became stars in the first place. But it's Joe Pesci's Oscar-winning performance that makes the movie, stealing almost every scene he's in. Director Martin Scorsese has totally knocked the ball out of the park with this movie. ""Goodfellas"" is the movie that precisely shows how extraordinary a director that Scorsese is. He perfectly captures the true gangster life, and tells the story in such a brilliant profession. Everything about this movie is filmmaking at it's finest. From the incredible performances by the ensemble cast, the brilliant well-written dialouge, directing, editing, cinematography, and music. By the way, this movie has some of the best writing ever put to film. The dialouge feels authentic and realistic, and it reveals the realism of it all. The violence is brutal and bloody, and some moments will leave you speechless. It doesn't matter if you're a fan of gangster films, or film in general, everybody will find something to love in ""Goodfellas"". Although this movie lost the Best Picture Oscar to ""Dances with Wolves"" in 1990, ""Goodfellas"" was a more better choice. This is an authentic, powerful, and excellent piece of work from the great Martin Scorsese. This is also one of my favorite movies of all time. ""Goodfellas"", in my review, ""original and authentic, an excellent masterpiece""."
24750,False,"20 Years after Joe Pesci asked, ""Do I amuse you?"" it's still hard not to be terrified by the selfish cruelty. The true story of mob rat Henry Hill seduces us with raw honesty and a charming ""matter of fact monologue"" by Ray Liotta. Is lying to yourself a white lie when it keeps you focused on the crime at hand? When Lorraine Bracco joins in and mirrors the storytelling monologue from the viewpoint of an outsider being charmed into the family, and suddenly the gangster genre is taken to new levels. Robert De Niro is masterful as Jimmy Conway spiraling out of control. Martin Scorcese's vision comes across through the inner workings of the Copacana to using the beautiful finality of the coda of ""Layla"", as the Lufthansa heist crew are innocently discovered all over the place. And these guys are Goodfellas? That's the hypocrisy played out."
24751,False,"I think that this movie shows a great combination of the rise and fall of the American mafia and how drugs played a huge part in bringing it down. The movie seems to cover all aspects of being a made member in the mafia and the problems that arise between money and greed. It shows how most of these men are complete sociopaths and have no regard for human life. A lot of mob movies show the glamorous side of being a mobster, but Goodfellas also shows the darker sides of these men and their activities. The actors portrayed what a made man was like back in the 1950's perfect. I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys Italian-American mob related history."
24752,False,"If I can pick out a flaw in this film it would be that it's unbelievably addictive. I remember there was a day I watched it twice back to back after watching it the day before and a couple of times the week before. Even though I knew what will happen each second and know every single dialogue I'm still so fascinated by the film, I'm so fascinated that I even purchased the book. Most people say books are better than films which I agree however Goodfellas surpassed the book! All credit goes to Martin Scorcese, the cast, the acting and the amazing music. From the minute Goodfellas start you just don't want the film to end you get so caught up in lives of 'Henry Hill', 'Jimmy Conway' and 'Tommy deSimone' (played to perfection by Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci who got an Oscar for his role)that you just want to live the life you wan to live their lives as Henry says 'I always wanted to be a Gangster' as he narrates it you understand why he wanted to become a gangster, why he chose to live this life. The way it's been portrayed by the cast is spectacular even by the young artist.Even after watching the film a couple of times I never knew that Goodfellas was based of real events I always somehow use to miss the beginning and ending credits. And once I started researching it I just thought to myself Wow how Martin Scorese made the film feel so realistic that every time I watch it i forget about the whole world and surroundings and I feel like I'm living around the likes of Henry Hilly and jimmy the gent. Even the real Henry Hill said that every actor portrayed their roles to perfection.This is not only the best gangster film ever made however it's the best film ever made and nothing will ever come close!"
24753,False,"Another old time movie that i watched. I'm interested in watching this movie because i was looking for a most recommended 'based-on-true-story movie'. I found this movie on the list and i intended to watch it. I'm not disappointed at all about the recommendation i got. :)Goodfellas tells a story about how a man became a gangster ever since he was a child, how's the life of a gangster and what a dramatic ending. Henry Hill played by Ray liotta was taking me to a real life gangster life. It left no space for fiction. It's all real. No excessive scene and very smooth rhythm. I can follow every step in the story and not being confused. It was great.I don't like too much shooting fight and that makes this movie my favorite. Even though it's a gangster movie, it shows perfectly enough shooting scene without reducing the story value. Neither the shooting nor the killing scene is making the movie bad.And i like Joe Pesci role in this movie. :D I saw some of his movie and i like this role best. He plays a real gangster, not the quiet one but the blabbermouth one. He speaks a lot and dare like a real criminal. Some scene i found out that he jokes too. lol. Honestly, i laugh every time he makes jokes. It's funny man. No doubt he got the Oscar for the supporting role. The thing that i learn from this true story movie is that your neighborhood has a great role in what one is going to be when one grown up. You see, in this movie, Henry hill wanted to become a gangster because he saw the life of gangster everyday in his neighborhood. He was influenced and ironically his parents didn't do the right to avoid this. Being harsh isn't the best way to teach, i think. The second thing is about greed. You get greed and you'll be all done. Greedy is such a disease that everyone ever tempted for. But, we must know that it leads to one end. FAILURE!"
24754,False,"Scorsese's Goodfellas is an incorruptible masterpiece with morals, wit, black humor, and cringe-inducing material, some of which the most graphic and brutal the man himself has ever filmed. It portrays the life of organized crime over the course of three decades, showing the central character who grew up idolizing the mob before almost despising it towards the end of the film. The result is a slick, unmatchable look at the way mobsters spoke, operated, and functioned from the fifties to the eighties and is one of the most powerful pictures for not only Scorsese, but for film itself in general.The story revolves around Irish-Italian Henry Hill (Liotta) who, ever since he was a youngster, looked up to the mob in his home of New York City. He says he wanted to be a gangster more than the president, because the gangsters had an untold amount of respect and dignity. The job revolves around persistency, bravery, emotionless devotion where one bad choice could ruin every good one you ever made in your life.Hill is taken under the wing of mob boss Paulie Cicero (Sorvino) and his loyal team of Jimmy Conway (De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Pesci). Conway operates as sort of an everyman mobster who is constantly watching his back, yet at times seems like he will crumble under all the pressure. While Tommy, on the other hand, is animalistic, unapologetic, and simply shameless, reacting impulsively on violence if someone looks at him the wrong way. Pesci's role as Tommy DeVito earned him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, quite possibly the most violent character to ever win. While Hill is working for Cicero at a young age he learns two of the most important life lessons early on in his career; ""Never rat on your friends, and always keep your mouth shut."" This begins Hill's long, relentless career as a mobster, which involves stealing, plotting, scheming, and constant commitment to the job. He gets married at a young age, to the heart-stopping beauty Karen (Bracco), a Jewish girl, much to the dismay of her mother. Karen falls for Hill's bravery, leadership, protection, and smarts early on, but realizes that once you married a mobster, you're now married to the job as well. That makes you a mob-wife; a position you can't refuse.Throughout the film, we see how Hill manages his mobster duties and his overall position. This is where the very Scorsese aspect comes into play. If you've been exposed to enough of the genius director, you'll know what he does best; the stories of people who rise and fall, or endured a reasonable amount of glory in a specific point in their life. In Casino, it showed a man named Sam ""Aces"" Rothstein, played by De Niro as well, struggle to run a Vegas casino with a number of roadside distractions. He was at the height of his game once, but a few faulty decisions on his part ran him straight into the ground. In The Aviator, one of Scorsese's more recent films, we meet the unsung filmmaker and aviation expert Howard Hughes, portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio. There, we dissect Hughes' glory years from when he directed the most expensive film of all time, to when he plummeted into a sea of nothing, becoming a sheltered germaphobe for a good remainder of his life. In Goodfellas, we see how a man can go from being a big shot to a self-indulgent, paranoid man consumed alive by his own greed, disrespect, and betrayal.Another recurring element, in pretty much every film by Scorsese, is we can see Scorsese's undeniable fascination with the material. We understand why he took the project just by the way he shot the film. We can see he takes a stern liking to the mob lifestyle, and sometimes, we get the faint impression he admires them. On the surface, and if we were to make a broad generalization, untold riches, cute Italian women, different ones every night, close friends, and fancy clubs and restaurants sounds divine to me. But they don't tell you that you must sleep with one eye open, and constantly avoid getting whacked. That part they left out of the manual.The performances, like in any film by the master, are simply divine - not a single one off pitch or even average. One performance that has gone overlooked is Lorraine Bracco. She is in the same position actress Sharon Stone would find herself in when playing Ginger in Casino, five years later. Bracco is in the position to overact, but never does. She is constantly improving as time goes on, and handles her climatic instances well. Not to mention, the male performances by De Niro, Liotta, Pesci, and Sorvino are all absolutely wonderful, always hitting the correct note in every place.Goodfellas is an American classic. Not a modern classic; a regular ol' classic. It is an enriching movie, with stylish writing (by Scorsese himself and Nicolas Pileggi, who wrote the novel the film is based on, Wiseguy), inevitably stellar performances, and an unforgettable score and setting that might leave you breathless at some points. The hardest part in any Scorsese film is picking a favorite scene. I think I've found one. It involves one the best jump scenes in any film I've seen recently. Along with evoking regret, naive instincts, and betrayal. It involves Joe Pesci. I will not say more.Starring: Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Paul Sorvino, and Lorraine Bracco. Directed by: Martin Scorsese."
24755,False,"Goodfellas is an adaptation of a true life book by Nicholas Pileggi detailing the life of Henry Hill. Ray Liotta as Hill is a good choice. Beginning in Brooklyn in the 1950s, we follow this high school drop out from his start as a petty criminal involved in hijackings to the Air France robbery in the 1960s. Henry gets deeper and deeper intoned mob life, including moving a dead body to avoid discovery by the police. After a stint in prison, Hill becomes a drug dealer and subsequently starts using large amounts of cocaine. Narcotics agents catch him and after ending up back in prison, he has to make tough choices given to him by the F.B.I. Th e supporting cast, especially Joe Pesci and Robert Deniro are terrific. The film is a bit long at almost 2 1/2 hours but worth your time."
24756,False,"Goodfellas (1990) Cast Robert De Niro as James (Jimmy) ConwayRay Liotta as Henry HillJoe Pesci as Tommy DevitoLorainne Bracco as Karen HillPaul Sorvino as Paul CiceroFrank Sivero as Frank CarboneTony Darrow as Sunny BunzMike Star as FrenchyFrank Vincent as Billy BattsGoodfellas is a biography of Henry Hill a gangster or more like a crook with mob ties who finds his way as a kid into organized criminal lifestyle. The plot of this film is based around power, money & greed which would in all likely hood is the down fall of the main character in this film, including Henry himself. Jimmy (Robert De Niro) would be a gangster that Henry looked up to. He liked jimmy style, in fact throughout the film you will see Henry dress like him and even begin to enter the rooms as he did commanding respect, flashing cash, a sort of Mans man attitude.Paulie (Paul Sorvino) on the other hand never actually did anything in the film be was feared by the gangsters alike. You never see Paulie get his hand dirty yet he does wind up in prison just as the others do.Tommy (Joe Pesci) was a lunatic, who not only did dirt but found it enjoyable, didn't blink an eye at killing someone for almost anything, a total out of control enforcer.These guys will be the guys Henry would have as his role models the editing and narration of the film made it a really good biopic. Editing was done as an inside out technique, it would show action happening then it would back up to explain how and why? Directed by Martin Scorsese who has done such films as The Departed & newly Shutter Island this film won a slew of accolades'. Including 2 Oscars, a truly incredible portrayal of a true life event. Written by Nicholas Pileggi in which the screen play was based on his book ""Wise Guy"". He also did another biography film known as Casino, another gangster base film. Directed by Martin Scorsese again. Sound quality would be different for both. In Goodfellas it would use Dolby Surround sound but in Casino DTS stereo quality was used.Lighting techniques were kind of dark, but gave a really good feel for secrecy, and confidential meetings, it came across well in the film. I would rate this feel as a must see film."
24757,False,"What is the formula behind making the perfect gangster movie? It has to be long, short gangster movies seldom work. There has to be a wide variety of characters, movies like ""The Hoodlum"" were dull because there were only a few main characters there. Here even the minor characters are well developed, enough to catch your eye. And last, it has to show some violence but in moderate quantities. There is some violence here, most notably in the ""Billy Batts scene"", but it never overflows, ""Casino"" had far more violent scenes than this film. If there is no violence whatsoever, then the movie can't be an effective gangster/mafia movie.But what is perhaps most appealing with this film is that, in contrast to movies like The Godfather trilogy, Scarface and Casino, this movie is based 100% on real events and characters. Only a few names are altered, the rest is all authentic.Robert De Niro again delivers, even though I think he has been somewhat miscast as Jimmy (Burke) Conway. Jimmy the Gent was Irish-American and even though DeNiro is part Irish himself, he doesn't look like a typical Irish-American. Burke was also a tall and imposing man, unlike DeNiro and he always chomped on a cigar. Doesn't help that DeNiro also has that unmistakable Italian-American drawl: ""Wats da madda wit u?""Pesci is just incredible and a delight to watch, despite playing a very unsympathetic character. Liotta fits his part perfectly as well and what I liked here is that they show his corruption by the mob world that embraced him in the beginning. If he had been shown as just some innocent naive sweet guy, it wouldn't look authentic, would it? Several scenes have since become classics, deservedly so. The ""Shinebox scene"" aka Billy Batts scene is perhaps the most unforgettable, but also the ""Funny Guy scene"". Elizabeth Bracco, even though not my favorite actress, offers a strong supporting role as mrs. Henry Hill, the headstrong and hot tempered Karen. Paul Sorvino is also marvelous in his somewhat restricted but pivotal part as Henry's close friend and first mentor Paulie Cicero. Frank Sivero from ""Godfather II"" is a welcome sight and his character is like a counterpart to Pesci's, a silent and unintentionally humorous sidekick.Scorsese scored big with this big screen adaptation of one of the most intriguing real-life mafia stories. This remains one of his crowning achievements."
24758,False,"Maybe it was I watched the amazing second part of the godfather right before this movie, but I thought this was not as good as most people made it out to be. Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent film. It's one of the top mafia films I have ever seen.This is the story of one guy and how he spent his life since childhood in the mafia.The acting is superb. I was pleased at the performances by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and especially Joe Pesci as the wild maniac. This also has to be Martin Scorcese's finest.One thing that bothered me here is there was no score, just pop songs. I liked the songs but I expected a score similar to the Godfather. I was disappointed there but that's pretty much my only disappointment.Overall, this is a very good gangster film. I recommend this to people who like these kind of films but it's also very violent. I rate this film 8/10."
24759,False,"1990 was a decent year for movies. We have the now-Christmas classic Home Alone, tear-jerker classic Ghost, several decent action-packed flicks (Hunt for Red October, Total Recall, Die Hard 2, Steven Segal before he became ridiculous), and of course, Rocky V (totally kidding). But, 20 years ago, there was one movie that truly rose up amongst the usual pile of movies and delivered one of the most exhilarating experiences in the history of cinema. Goodfellas is a masterpiece of its genre, and would change the movie world forever. It was too intense for some, but if you can rise past the grittiness, you are in for a wild ride through the drugs, violence, humor, and money associated with life in the gangsterhood. This movie would change a genre forever, and would pave the way for several promising careers.Much like the way Sergio Leone (and eventually Clint Eastwood) made classic westerns (For a Few Dollars More being my favorite) that made all the other westerns made at the time inferior, Goodfellas made The Godfather and all crime/mafia pictures look silly. That's right, I said it. Godfather is a decent flick, but it is no Goodfellas. Nowadays, whenever you make a gangster movie, you aren't borrowing details or techniques of Coppola, you are copying good ol' Martin Scorsese and his masterful directing style associated with this flick. Even television shows have a lot to owe to Goodfellas--The Sorpranos features over 25 actors and actresses that were in the movie. Easily the best film from 1990, and easily the best crime-film of all-time.Goodfellas follows the lives of several gangsters and their families throughout multiple decades, as you see their rise and fall in terms of position, power, and money. All of this is being narrated by the main character, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). What separates Goodfellas from every mafia/gangster film before and since its release is its very humble, down-to-earth presentation of its story. While The Godfather made the mafia life a larger-than-life event with a God-complex, Goodfellas toned it down and made it look like a gritty, blue-collar lifestyle that pays well and provides plenty of benefits. Also, unlike all gangster films at the time, Goodfellas didn't just focus on the main players, but also focused on the wives, mistresses, kids, and families of the gangsters involved. It was a family affair, and this was a realization that Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi clearly pointed out in their excellent script full of crisp diologue and plenty of substance.Another great thing about Goodfellas is that gangsters, bosses, villains were all given a heavy dosage of human character. They were all people you can relate to, they weren't just existing and talking to progress the plot, they engaged in deep conversations about subjects that were not always related to their job. When the audience can associate themselves with the people in the film, it's a great connection, and few films can connect better than Goodfellas. It never feels like a film that is 146 minutes long.Complimenting the superb writing was the phenomenal acting. Every single performance was excellent, from the small (Samuel L. Jackson) to the much bigger roles (Joe Pesci, Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta). The excellent cast of actors and actresses contributed mightily to the powerfulness, and the humbleness of the movie, as it humanized the lifestyles of mobs, gangsters, and the mafia. Even the rampaging murderer Joe Pesci portrayed was likable because despite his rage and murderous attitude, you can still feel his admiration and care for some of the people around him.But the standout feature of Goodfellas has got to be the phenomenal directing of Martin Scorsese. Prior to Goodfellas, there was not a single director that perfectly mixes long shots, close-ups, track-shots, freeze-frames, long takes, and gritty hand-held-like cinematography like Scorsese. The movie lacked the long, artsy, pointless sweeping shots of most gangster films before 1990; not a single shot or scene of Goodfellas was unnecessary. For example the wedding scene of the first Godfather went on for too long because of its constant shots of the wedding events; now compare that to the epic long tracking shot of the main character entering the Copacabana. The action and the mayhem was always close-up, sometimes with a gun pointed directly at the camera, as if it was right on your face.Bottom Line: If you enjoy a good film, then Goodfellas is for you. If you have not seen it, you are missing out on one of the greatest displays of perfect directing in the history of film, and easily the best crime film you'll ever witness. From the writing to the acting to the music selected to the flawless mix of style and substance, Goodfellas set the bar much higher for films of its kind, and all adult films overall. It's one of the first modern Hollywood films to not have that Hollywood touch; as it remains down-to-earth, and allowed for a similar R-rated crime masterpiece (Pulp Fiction) to flourish a couple of years later.While the general public usually ranks The Godfather as the quintessential crime film, I am one of the few that will safely say that The Godfather is overrated, and it's because movies like Goodfellas exist. This film is very realistic, very intense, and full of so many spectacular moments, you'll need multiple viewings to truly embellish yourself in it all. This movie is literally only one scene away from cinematic perfection (the infamous Last Day as a Wiseguy scene ran just a bit too long). I strongly recommend this movie, as it will change the way you watch movies. And if you are aspiring to be in the film industry, it will change the way you make them."
24760,False,"Goodfellas is Martin Scorsese's remarkable mobster classic of all time. This delicately handled masterpiece has everything a great movie should have...intense story, gripping screenplay, fabulous direction, excellent cinematography, and most important of all, perfect star cast. The performances by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Paul Sorvino are outstanding. The way Joe Pesci's character portrayed is worth a special mention. I am a huge fan of Pesci since Raging Bull, but I would remember him as 'Tommy' for the rest of my life. Twenty years after release, I've seen this film now and I can say without a doubt it's a modern classic. Twenty years from now, this movie still will be a modern classic. Hats off to Martin Scorsese!!"
24761,False,"One of the best films ever made revolving around a bunch of mobsters (aka -wise-guys). A film of this calibre is hard to sum up in such few words. Where to even begin? It's a fantastic story-line (based on a true story), has amazing acting, De Niro and Pesci give awesome performances and really work fantastically well together. It has one of the best directors of all time in Scorcese, who is the master in this genre. Put these all together and you have yourself an awesome flick. It's fast paced, incredibly smart, funny yet gritty. If you enjoy hard hitting gangster films you'll be glued to the screen and are sure to relish it! I've watched it several times and never tire of it!""I go from Rags To Riches"""
24762,False,"Goodfellas, a film that immediately grabs your attention and doesn't let go to the final credits. The film runs for almost Two and a halve hours but one would never notice the time racing away due to brilliant structure and narrative. Henry's Narration gives this film a calming effect, he never shouts he just tells the story as if he being investigated by the cops. With the narrative, the films rolls like a dream. The pacing is perfect and not once do you hang around the same scene.In these two hours, you learn how Henry always wanted to be a gangster. He tells you this in the first three minutes of the film. 10 minutes later, he a gangster and from here on, you witness the power and glamour you receive when everyone knows who you are. The acting is brilliant. Ray Liotta gives a outstanding performance while Joe Pesci is steals every scene he in . DeNiro role is not as large as one would like but he still gives a strong presence.The Art design is another brilliant achievement . The world around you is portrayed perfectly that you can't help but be dragged into the setting. This is also helped by the directing which brings great style and editing that the film is like a dream. Overall, a great film"
24763,False,"This movie is great. I just have such a good time watching it. It is at the very top in the genre of crime dramas. The characters are very, very memorable. The film has a nice sense of humor, and conversations are very well written. I am very entertained while watching it. A very big part of that is due to the actors having a lot of charisma in their roles. Joe Peshi is the best example of this. He is very violent and easily tempered, and does a good job at adding more to the character with his great acting. It is a very big part of of crime drama history. It is a very good film that I highly recommend to anyone who hasn't enjoyed it.4 stars out of 4"
24764,False,"When ""Goodfellas"" was in theatrical release, I did not see it. I was having a fit of ""cinematic malaise""...there simply were not a whole heck of a lot of good flicks coming out during that time, and the slew of street thug movies actually made it somewhat dangerous to venture out into theaters in some cities. A lot of us said ""to hell with it"" and decided to concentrate on our own VHS collections and catch up on films when they became available for rent or purchase. Consequently, I did not see ""Goodfellas"" until 1999. I'd heard about the film, and I must say my own legs were not long enough to kick myself in the rear for waiting so long to see it. And this was just one of the films I had to catch up with...there were a number of others. I did not think that this film could top most of the other mob-type films that had already been made. I was wrong. The film was engrossing form the outset. Joe Pesci was loud and scary...and Paul Sorvino was relatively quiet and scary...in a way that was more menacing and perhaps more disturbing than Pesci...which was acting that took quite a bit of doing. I was rather roughed up at some of the language and the racial references...it took me a while to reconcile this...they were products of the times. One thing that caught my eye--and ear--was that Scorsese kept the imagery in a kind of 1960s mode. No long sideburns or long haircuts. No dog-eared shirts...no wide neck-ties or lapels. This hurt the film from a standpoint of making it flow with time...but the performances and the characters help to overcome this.The story is very well told, and Scorsese does it masterfully. One can see that he had a direct influence on Tarantino, especially when the film opens with the murder of a ""made man"" in the mob...a story that we return to much later in the film. Tarantino borrowed that style and essentially made it his own. Pesci re-defined the definition of a madman in a screen performance of a character who did not live to the end of the film...but yet will not die. Sorvinos broad range has seen him playing such diverse characters as Bible-thumping fundamentalist ministers...even a rape victim. But his stature as a tough guy is secure...one glance from those steely eyes can penetrate the audience, and you can see Perdition itself through it all. Bob De Niro plays, of all things, a character who is only half-Italian, which would dis-qualify him from becoming a ""made man"" for the mob no matter what he does. His, too, is a very broad spectrum. I have a few reservations about recommending the film 100%. It is very realistic, very graphic and very violent. But, seldom is the truth a very pretty thing to look at. See Goodfellas...if you haven;t already. If you have...see it again. It is part of my collection now."
24765,False,"I've watched Godfellas six times, and every time I watch it I find out something new. You know, this is the movie of the 90's, by far the best Gangster movie after GodFather.The cast is great, De Niro is at his best, Lliota does his job pretty well, but the greatest actor of this movie is Joe Pesci. You like his character (Tommy De Vito) even thought you want him to die. Scorsese is a great director, everyone knows, but in GodFellas he is AT HIS BEST.The history is very well crafted, and there is no ""useless"" scenes, every scene has it own paper. The soundtrack is pretty good too, the most memorable is on Billy Batts scene! If you have never watched Godfellas, GO WATCH IT NOW! For me, it deserves a 10/10"
24766,False,"This movie throws originality and creativity at you, and it's impossible for you to not be captivated. This movie is the entertaining itself, and because of its excellent direction, editing, and performances, this movie is a masterpiece, and one of the best.This film views the mob lives of three pivotal figures in the 1960's and 70's New York. Henry Hill (Liotta) is a local boy turned gangster in a neighborhood full of the roughest and toughest. Tommy Devito (Pesci) is a pure bred gangster, who turns out to be Henry's best friend. Jimmy Conway (De Niro) puts the two of them together, and runs some of the biggest hijacks and burglaries the town has ever seen. After an extended jail sentence, Henry must sneak around the back of the local mob boss, Paulie Cicero (Sorvino), to live the life of luxury he has always dreamed of. In the end, the friends end up in a hell of a jam, and must do anything they can to save each other, and stay alive.Scorsese, who is one of the best directors of all time (If not the best), probably made his best work with this one (I don't know if it's better than ""Casino"", but it probably is), his camera angles are amazing, and the narrative never let the movie get boring. And with the incredible editing, that is as good as the direction With a cast of Ray Liotta, De Niro, and Joe Pesci, I don't even need to say how mesmerizing the acting is, specially by Pesci, who make his character so hot head that you don't know if he's going to kiss the guy, or kill him. Ray Liotta surprised me in this one, and he was awesome, and of course, with the help of his charismatic character. De Niro is... Do I really have to say? Verdict: Scorsese's masterpiece, and one of the best movies of all time, with amazing performances by all it's cast, specially by Pesci, you'll notice that this film is beyond good."
24767,False,"Where do I begin with ""Goodfellas""? How do I start off my review for a movie that is absolutely mind-blowing.A movie that is gritty and dirty, yet beyond entertaining at the same time.Can a movie possibly be this good? When it comes to this movie, it is possible.I was left astonished when the end credits were over.I was left thinking ""Wow! What a great film!"". I am not over-reacting here folks.I am not trying to compete with another movie.I am telling you the truth.If you have not seen this film, then there is no point in talking to you.This Martin Scorsese film is an exhilarating piece of American filmaking that's well directed, well acted, and well constructed.The only other film that I've seen from Martin is ""Shutter Island"", which was another great movie, despite what some critics said.I feel that I must warn you: This is an extremely gritty and dirty mafia movie.Swearing and violence run rampant in this film, so viewers who can't stand brutal beatings and four-letter words being uttered out every 5 seconds are going to be in for a depressing experience.But that's not the point.How much do you think the real life Mafia swear and murder? That's what I thought.As explicit this movie is, It's also an Oscar worthy sensation.Joe Pesci really steals the show here.De Nero and Liotta are good, but Pesci brings the thunder here.Do not miss this movie.If you see it on the shelf, but it.Steal it if you have to.Just be sure to witness what may be one of the greatest crime-dramas of all time! No joke."
24768,False,"---May contain spoilers---I had heard so may positive things about Goodfellas and had read so many reviews, so when i sat down a couple of nights ago, I was expecting nothing short of a masterful depiction of gangster life, what i watched didn't not fall short of my high expectations. The film centres on Henry Hill, portrayed by Ray Liotta, who gradually moves up the ranks in the organised crime scene in New York and eventually becomes on the most respected, feared and loved gangsters in the city. Scorsese is flawless in evoking the consequences of becoming embroiled in the deeply exciting yet wholly damaging dynamics of gangster life. The film is wonderfully directed by Scorsese in this regard and also in the depths of characterisation that are apparent in the film. Examples of this include the friendliness yet relentless ruthlessness shown by Jimmy Conway (played by a wonderfully convincing Robert De Niro) Joe Pesci, perhaps, steals the show with his chilling yet hugely amusing portrayal of Tommy DeVito with whom he transcends a brilliant mix of violence and humour. is efforts with this character were deservedly recognised with an Academy Award for Acot in a supporting role. In my opinion, the films most engaging and powerful element is the spiral out of control that Henry Hill experiences when he indulges in drug use and infidelities. The film also seems to flow effortlessly from scene to scene which makes the 146 minute running time seem a lot shorter.10/10. A great effort from Scorsese, his directing was awe-inspired, and Liotta, De Niro and Pesci combined produce a fantastic ensemble of gangster characters."
24769,False,"20 years ago Marty Scorsese put out a movie that was so entertaining, so full of great dialogue that we've(at least I have) been quoting it ever since.The fact that your probably never get another Deniro, Pesci, Scorsese collaboration again is enough of a reason to worship this work. The rapid cuts, the great crazy camera movement and the fact that soooo many actors were in this movie for small parts(i.e. see Tobin Bell and Samuel L. Motherf*****ing Jackson in the credits.)makes for, you guessed it, awesomeness.Goodfellas is one of the only films I can watch repeatedly without getting bored. Maybe I'm a fanatic. And maybe I'm just obsessed. And just maybe your taste sucks if you don't love Goodfellas. Frankly there hasn't been a piece of cinema that compares in my book. That's right, I said it. If you got a problem you can go talk to Tommy about it."
24770,False,"The strange thing about me is that I only saw Goodfellas in the morning and I had no idea that a film like this could blow me away. I started watching it at twelve midnight and was expecting myself to fall asleep but thankfully it didn't because the story grips you and doesn't let go. For a movie that is two and a half hours long, it didn't have any boring bits and every scene was better than the last. The narration by the main character is neat and I really like it how he explained his life from the point he became a gangster all the way to the end. The acting was superb by everyone, famous and not so famous, because they just fitted comfortably in their roles. The actor who amazed me the most was Joe Pesci mainly since his comedy makes you laugh out loud but he also had a darker role as well. He played a gangster who would kill if he was spoken to the way he didn't like. Robert De Niro played the calm but paranoid gangster who gave money to people because they opened doors for him. Goodfellas is mainly about a boys life as he grows up and turns into a gangster. Ray Liotta plays the role exceptionally well but one thing that made me didn't like him was his annoying laugh. Martin Scorsese should have cut that part out and chucked into the lave of Krakatoa. When the film finished at two thirty, I stayed still digesting the film and was amazed by what had happened. It truly is a treasure and every DVD collector should have it in their collection. A film like Goodfellas perfectly explains a gangsters life, his marriage, his family and kids, his friends, his sins and good deeds, to the point where your brain is pouring out the information because it can't stand it. Goodfellas is the only film that has got a perfect ten from me in the last six or seven months. A masterpiece! Kids and adults should watch it (f*ck the rating system) and should definitely have a good time watching the best film from Martin Scorsese. The sound and music is very nice when a thrilling part comes on and it gives you a tingling sensation. ""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster."" -- Henry Hill, Brooklyn, N.Y. 1955, is the best line in film history in my opinion. Ray Liotta says it like it was meant for him his whole life.This film views the mob lives of three pivotal figures in the 1960's and 70's New York. Henry Hill is a local boy turned gangster in a neighborhood full of the roughest and toughest. Tommy Devito is a pure bred gangster, who turns out to be Henry's best friend. Jimmy Conway puts the two of them together, and runs some of the biggest hijacks and burglaries the town has ever seen.

In the end, the friends end up in a hell of a jam, and must do anything they can to save each other, and stay alive. (copied from IMDb Page).Watching Goodfellas on Blu-Ray will making the viewing experience just a tiny bit better. What can be better than watching this in high definition? Eh, nothing! Why didn't Goodfellas win more than one Oscar? It should have won two more: one for best director and best picture."
24771,False,"Back in the early 90's, criminals simply weren't presented as they really were. This started the trend in the proper direction, showing a schism in organized crime that cracked it's foundation and highlighted the downward swing they've been on for decades now.Brooklyn born and raised Henry Hill is half Irish and therefore can't be a made man. His neighbourhood cronies treat him like family, but still he can never get to the big leagues of the mob. Paulie is their particular district's big boss, who detests drugs and the threat they represent to his way of conducting business (and staying out of prison). Jimmy is homicidal and also the greatest and most shameless thief around, who's been in and out of jail since childhood and also can't be made and fully accepted due to his Irish blood. And to round out this cast of characters is Tommy, a smoking gun that bristles with hot headed rage at the slightest imagined insult. Together, this can only add up to trouble!Paulie is one of the last who believes in the old code and the coming cocaine revolution is like a tidal wave that will reduce his little world to rats scurrying off the sinking ship that organized crime is degenerating into. Under his watch, the younger men that are like sons to him lie, break rank with their criminal common sense and generally act like they prefer stupidity over any kind of self preservation. Little remarks at a card game or bar or on the street get people killed faster than lightning. Huge scores are not about equal shares when one man wants everything, save for a tribute kicked up to the big boss, for himself.The mob could have continued all powerful if certain trends hadn't taken over. But what went down meant becoming an informer wasn't unthinkable anymore, it was now plan B. The soldiers on the streets felt their superiors were out of touch with major opportunities and the old moustache Petes lost the battles they could never win. Drugs were and are at every level of society and Henry Hill was one of countless souls that didn't save for a rainy day because they wanted to get high and ignored the depth of the big picture.Read the amazing book ""Wiseguy"" Nicholas Pileggi wrote with Henry's no holds barred account of his sordid life filling out the details one really needs to fully appreciate this film. There are millions of criminals in the world, but most of them never go on the record so unnervingly."
24772,False,"I have no idea what that says about me, but, what the hell. I saw this back in 1990 and probably 15 more times since and I still love it. I don't think I fast-forward through any scene. I love everything about it. Nothing seems far-fetched or implausible or stupid. The dialogue seems real as well as these peoples' unfathomable culture. To this day, I find myself quoting and thinking about this movie. Here is a story about a kid who grows up NYC thinking that being a bad guy ain't that bad. Reminds me of someone who wants to be a rock star except being a musician is legal. Henry Hill wanted money, women, respect, and didn't want to work too hard. It just so happens he ran around with some guys who took themselves a bit too seriously. Ultimately, the party (and the movie) had to stop and this guy's demise is just as entertaining as his rise to the ""top"".If you love hearing that NYC Italian dialect and seeing what people thought was fashionable back then you'll enjoy this movie. Also, the dichotomy of these crook's lifestyle and their purported faith & ethical code is portrayed enjoyably too.Thanks to the cast and crew. My new gangster film on heavy rotation is The Departed and we will see if that one too withstands the test of time."
24773,False,"... Loved both. Goodfellas was based on true story of Henry Hill. This film had it all. Henry Hill started as a child being enthralled with the Mafia life. His dad just a regular working stiff . Henry was seduced by the life, the money, the excitement, the risks and of course the women. Excellent acting by all. This movie , singlehandedly , brought back the organized gang movies , we all loved from the 70s. In fact, this film was a segueway to 'The Sopranos'. Lorraine Bracco of 'The Sopranos' as well as Michael Imperioli ,in a bit part ,contributed to the fine acting. Throw in the character of Morrie and a wet behind the ears Samuel L. Jackson, and this ensemble ,was even more unbelievable. Perhaps the best acted movie of the 90's. This movie really portrayed the gang life in just under 2 and half hrs. If I do have one criticism, I think the film did not truly show the ordinary parts of life , that these people have when they are with their families, as 'The Sopranos. I did not take away points because 'The Sopranos' had all the time in the world to get away with that. This film , cleverly, pointed out how even top members of organized crime are not immune from violence or even from financial failure for that matter. I liked the narration by Ray Liotta. I think that really helped educate people , as to THE LIFE and the rituals of organized crime.This movie also did an excellent job with the costumes and the film set, to bring us back to these earlier dates. Movie can be squeamish at times, but it was meant to be realistic. You really do feel that you are a part of this group."
24774,False,"Another mob film and this too delivers.Goodfellas definitely comes close to The Godfather series in terms of mob violence and acting.And that too is a big achievement.The pace of the film is what you've got to watch out for.It is definitely fast as compared to The Godfather but in terms of acting it definitely lacks a bit to The Godfather stalwarts.Ray Liotta,Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro all deliver knock out performances in this gangster drama.Goodfellas is one of the greatest movies ever made and would definitely haunt you for days to come.In one word,Amazing."
24775,False,"The obvious comparison for this movie is, of course, ""The Godfather."" Looked at in that way, I thought ""Goodfellas"" was the superior movie - actually, not even close. Where some of the characters in ""The Godfather"" (especially Brando's Don Corleone) had an almost cartoonish aura around them, everyone in this movie seemed very real. There were no cartoonish elements to this, and no one in this movie was ever fated to be a caricature, in the way Brando as Corleone was. This was a down to earth, realistic story about life in the mob, shown mostly through the eyes of Henry (Ray Liotta), who, as an Irish Italian kid, glamorizes gangsters and gets involved with them as a kid, and then lives his life among them. Liotta was very good, as were all the main actors is this - Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco all did well with their respective parts, and you come away from this movie thinking that you have a feel for what it's like to live this life. As the movie comes to an end, and Henry becomes a snitch, testifying against some of his former ""buddies,"" you also get a dose of reality. These guys don't go to the cops out of any real change of heart or because they're suddenly stricken by a guilty conscience and decide to go straight. Henry suddenly realized he was in danger, and the only way to protect himself and his family was to testify. In the voice-over narration the point is well made that, even as he's testifying against these guys, he still envies them their lifestyle and enjoyed sharing it for a good number of years, and going straight is the price he has to pay for safety.Certainly, a better move than ""The Godfather."" In all honesty, I think they're both over-rated on this site as the 2nd-best (""Godfather"") and 15-th best (""Goodfellas"") movies of all time at the time of writing. Having said that, I did enjoy watching ""Goodfellas."" 8/10"
24776,False,"As far back as Henry Hill can remember, he always wanted to be a gangster. His dreams are realized early on in his childhood as he ascends the ranks of the mafia in Brooklyn, NY and then finds his life descending into a downward spiral that forces him out of society altogether. This is his true story, adapted from a novel by Nicholas Pileggi and brought to the screen by writer/director Martin Scorsese.Authenticity plays a big role in the film. Because it is a true story about real people, it would be nothing if the characters didn't feel authentic. Thankfully we have the great Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci (who subsequently won an Oscar for his role) along with Ray Liotta (in, no doubt, his finest role) bringing the players in the film to life so naturally. Nothing these actors do is over-done nor glamorized in any way. In fact, it's almost as if the trio personally knew the people they were portraying before committing their interpretations to film. For all of their character flaws and ugliness, nothing is sugar-coated, and the film is the better for it. Of course, it helps with a solid supporting cast that includes Paul Sorvino, Lorraine Bracco, and Frank Sivero. Bracco, in particular, gives the viewer someone to live through the experience with, as she witnesses and comes to term with the shocking reality she must adapt to. The film is no doubt violent and brutal, but is delivered with a touch of class as only Martin Scorsese can bring to the game. This film alone is a testament to his status as one of America's finest film-makers. Conjuring up images that will stay with you long after your first viewing, Scorsese makes the ultra-violence as real as it should be and brings only the finest performances out of even the smallest players in the pack. Helping to commit the film to memory is a brilliant soundtrack of popular tunes that spans three decades and serves as a stunning example of popular music used effectively in cinema. If you remember one thing about ""Goodfellas,"" it may very well be Eric Clapton's ""Layla"" and the grisly and haunting images that accompany it.Without a doubt, ""Goodfellas"" is one of the finest mob films ever made and, at the very least, is certainly one of Scorsese's best. From the cast to the music and everything in between, it is complete, sweet and sensational perfection. View it, and you'll see why it was such a smashing success and why it is still considered a classic almost 20 years later."
24777,False,"A classic wiseguy flick, a classic Scorsese. It's dynamic, funny, and rewrites the accepted lines of exhilaration and disgust by mixing panache and violence. Scorsese has created a great document of the mobster life that can stand alongside Coppola's famous Godfather films. Yet he's done it in his own inimitable style, bursting with the energy of the four decades it takes in.From the off the film's temperament is dictated by Ray Liotta's career-defining role as Henry. His behaviour is dictated entirely by self- interest - Liotta manages to establish a wonderfully neurotic, porous self-awareness that means he's always an outsider trying too hard to please the paymaster... most of the time that means Paul Sorvino's outstanding, pre-Gandolfini capo, and of course very different bosses call his tune at the denouement. The film is also notoriously a playpen for the more outré behaviour of Joe Pesci, a guilty delight. Lorraine Braco is equal to her considerable supporting role as Liotta's moll. 8/10"
24778,False,"Goodfellas is a stylish, well executed film, and probably Martin Scorcese's best film. Based on the real life story of notorious gangster Henry Hill, Goodfellas is up there with other Crime classics such as; The Godfather (1 and 2) and Scarface. Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro give spectacular performances and Henry, Jimmy and Tommy who regularly get involved with drugs, murders, heists and thefts. From what I've heard it sticks very well to the book it was based on (Wiseguy), and if it's half as good as the film it will be definitely worth the read. Goodfellas gets into my personal top 10 list, ranking as my personal favourite crime movie. See it."
24779,False,"Definitely one of the better Mob movies of the past 30 years. Ray Liotta gives a great performance as Henry Hill,, from a youngster all the way up to the very end when he is older. also starring is Robert deniro,, Joe Pesci,, and Paul Sorvino,, as Paulie, the boss,, there are other characters in here that just make the picture also,, the movie deals with the rise and fall of the gangsters,, especially trailing the career of one Henry Hill,, some of the characters do end up in jail,, some do get out,, and others not so lucky,, there is rampant cocaine use in here, you get the effects of watching henry as he gets paranoid after snorting a bunch of it. all in all i think that this is probably even better than the godfather i thought,, but it's a close call."
24780,False,"There are several good plot synopses up already, so I'll avoid that and just say what I liked and didn't about it. Maybe the few people who haven't seen it will appreciate this.So apparently this is the one that re-started fascination with the mob. I like how different it was from Godfather. They say it influenced the Sopranos. I can see a little of that, but to me is just not quite as satisfying.Liotta, Brocco, Pesci and the rest of the gang are all great in this movie. It's cool because of Henry--Liotta--'s outside perspective. I dig how it's not exactly easy being a mobster either. It's never quite as glamorous as it seems, and on top of that, the crazy fellas who are in that business are crazy enough to turn on you at any time. Pesci's famous ""Funny how?...Am I a clown? Do I amuse you?"" is classic for good reason.Still, Scorsese has this weird obsession with making at least the last 45 minutes seem like a video for 70s AM radio greatest hits. It really gets in the way of the movie for me...big time. (I'm a musician by trade, so I love music. It's not a prejudice. The songs chosen here are all cool songs too, just way too loud and pervasive.) The big lessons aren't quite so big in this one either. That's fine, but you expect a little more from this crew. On the other hand, maybe that should be seen as refreshing. And in a lot of ways it is.I would recommend it for anyone who wants a lighter mob movie, and one that seems oddly more realistic because of the domestic issues. Also, the time frame helps it stand out in a cool way. It's very good, no doubt."
24781,False,"While the title of mob masterpiece most often goes to ""The Godfather"" for its stunning drama and dark beauty, something must be said for honesty. Those two points belong to Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas,"" which plays up the highs and lows of gangster life in cold truth, without any jazzed-up one-liners or thematic scores, with only honest-to-goodness storytelling and direction.Some crime films rely on characters killing or torturing people in crazy and memorable ways, but in ""Goodfellas,"" when the only nutty character, Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), blows his fuse a few times, it feels jarring and unnatural, not cool or awing in any way. It's because to Scorsese, these people are real, this is their life, and a hit is a hit because that's how they do things -- there's not a production to be made out of it. The film, based on true events with much consultation from the real life people who were being portrayed in the film, focuses on gangster Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and how the mob raised him and gave him everything he had, brought him the highest of highs and took him pretty low -- might have even killed him had he not entered the Witness Protection Program in the '80s. Scorsese isn't brilliant in this film. It's not visionary. Leave that for some of his other films -- this is just incredibly good storytelling. ""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster"" is not a memorable line that pulls you in at the film's beginning because it was inspired writing -- it's Scorsese understanding how to take a script and bring it to life in the best way possible. The only truly artistic work being done is some of the camera shots and compelling angles. He finds the script's best moments and adds something to them. Otherwise, he is telling this story, he is making a cinematic homage to this incredible true story as penned by Nicholas Pileggi.Of course it helps that the actors he had to work with were top notch. Following him from ""Raging Bull"" among other films were Robert DeNiro and Pesci as Jimmy and Tommy. Both characters are easily provoked, sometimes irrational men with big mouths their hearts in the right place despite actions to the contrary. Pesci is particularly memorable between the ""in what way am I funny?"" and ""deer paw"" scenes, a deserved Oscar for great character work. As for Liotta, his great strength is swaying our opinion of him back and forth with his various infidelities yet natural charms -- it's a role that had Scorsese cast 15 years later would have gone to the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, so let that stand as some acclaim for Liotta. It is also this dichotomy of warm support and foul-mouthed matter-of-factness that makes us feel conflicted as we watch the entire film. It doesn't elicit pity for the mafia, but it certainly complicates the ""wiseguy"" stereotype, which I think is much of Scorsese's goal.""Goodfellas"" only lacks in an emotional or cathartic pull. Many times you wonder why this story is being told, but then you realize how incredibly well it's told and you acknowledge that it's some of the finest film-making out there, regardless how it makes you feel."
24782,False,"Goodfellas quite effortlessly embeds itself near the top of the tree in terms of both the best of the genre and the best of a certain director. That director is Martin Scorsese; a man whose films, it seems, reach out to generation after generation because of their timeless studies of the male who's placed within a scenario of either psychological crisis or social misfit; often both. Scorsese's films are journeys, but they never seem to branch out beyond the constraints of a city or the small, designated and rather run down area in which they're set. There are no vast landscapes or set pieces involving glitzy cinematography; just down and dirty locales inhabited by people you wouldn't usually notice or want to pay much attention to, only Scorsese brings them to life in that way that he does.Such is Goodfellas, an old fashioned yarn about the rise and consequent fall of a gangster who begins life at the bottom of the pecking order before working their way up and then realising that once you're in that groove you've been searching for, you become even more vulnerable than before. Goodfellas isn't the sort of film you revisit because you're tired of Scorsese's more recent efforts. From what I've seen following Goodfellas, he hasn't made a great film since his 1990 mob thriller but that's not to say any of his films since haven't been at least good to some degree.The film tiptoes along that fine line that makes organised crime or indeed Mafia life look 'cool', or 'sexy' or the sort of lifestyle you might want to get involved in. It's important to recognise that, by the end, Ray Liotta's Henry Hill has become the one thing he feared most before even starting out in 'the life' and that's a regular guy who lives in a suburban house, with a mailbox and a newspaper on the doorstep every morning. It sounds like he ended up pretty well off considering the amount of blood, violence and death that awaits rather a few of the other characters that inhabit Goodfellas, but that's not to say it's a brain dead blood bath designed to appeal to the masses. Each and every death; act of violence - Hell, even every gunshot resounds with the viewer in a chilling and quite frightening manner; whoever the victim and whoever the instigator. Some are more jarring than others, but we feel a certain something toward each individual that is involved in a grizzly end.Such is the power of the character study here. Henry Hill is young and on the brink of his teen years. He lives opposite a restaurant in Brooklyn, New York in the 1950s and doesn't look at but gazes at the activity that goes on down there on ground level as organised crime syndicates go about their business. The first time he sees blood or the results of acts of extreme violence is the first time we do, when one member stumbles back to the place of business in agony. Hill meets fellow Italian and Irish American alike gangsters in Jimmy Conway (De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Pesci), both based on real life people whom, I read, are as akin to their real life persona's as possible. What follows is a study of life, love, theft, murder and honour all within a Mafia orientated arena.Apart from most things, Goodfellas is a cracking ride. At two and a half hours, but never feeling like it, you have fly through the lives of these people in no time at all. Hill's voice-overs provide most of the toned down and grubby information required on how he lived as a child complete with violent father a truancy problems and when those switch to Karen (Bracco) and her, worried if anything perspective, it acts as a jolt to the audience as the mindset of a man in Henry who is slowly getting involved to the point in which he may assume himself invincible. Of course towards the end, he really does loose it as a cocaine deal and a large family meal clash on the same day in what is a sequence of events that work on several dramatic and humorous levels at once.I think the most resounding reason Goodfellas comes across as so good and so memorable is its strength in depth in regards to individual scenes or moments. Just thinking about certain sequences, such as the long take in which Henry makes his way across a public street and breaks someone's nose with a revolver or the scene in which the guys sit around Tommy's mother's table and talk and eat casually, despite the fact there's a dying man in Tommy's car which is parked outside, just produce chills. One of the more famous scenes is, of course, Tommy's ""Funny? Funny how?"" tirade. Even when the film begins to remove us from the life of crime and more towards the older age that these characters approach, Scorsese does it in such a way that we're cool with the genre being manipulated and branching out into something else. Goodfellas is, and will continue to be, a very impressive and worthwhile film for many those who stumble across it."
24783,False,"This has become such a great movie to me I faithfully watch it once a year. I wish it hadn't competed with 'Dances With Wolves' in 1990 because, well, how can you argue with that decision. But if it had won, I certainly would have been happy.Such an epic film; such great acting from everyone involved. Quite frankly, I think it missed a lot of academy awards because, really, you could have given it to everyone. How many supporting actors can you give it to.But really, come on, Jeremy Irons over Ray Liotta?Anyway, I assume most have seen it and if you haven't then you have an incredible movie to watch, if you wish.Every single scene was masterly directed by Scorsese. I saw this 15 years ago and was riveted to the screen."
24784,False,"Seriously speaking i am very biased towards 'Goodfellas' mainly due to three reasons.Firstly,Robert De Niro is my best actor.Secondly,Martin Scorceese is my best director and thirdly,according to me this is the best work of Martin Scorceese till date. Great story,Great acting by all the three lead actors-De Niro,Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci,Great approach towards portraying the characters,Great camera work,Great Scripting,Great editing and above all Great direction.I have seen this movie for around 20 times,yet,i don't feel bored for a single moment during the movie.I have shown this movie to all my friends and in each time i have seen it again along with them.It seems that the purpose of my life is to show this movie to each and every person under the sun.I simply love this movie. Pity on those who have'nt seen it yet!!!!"
24785,False,Goodfellas is the definition of a great film. I bought Goodfellas a few weeks ago and I was blown away. The Plot: the plot was just amazing. It was interesting and it keeps you on the edge your seat every second. The Acting: Now this was really the main point of the movie. Robert De Niro gives his best performance and Jimmy Conway. De Niro keeps the film fresh and exciting. Joe Pesci was a real shocker too. Pesci's role as the crazy little gangster was so amazing. He may be the bad guy but you just end up liking him. Ray Liotta was the main man. His acting was perfect in every way. He really made Henry Hill come to life. The Director: Martin Scorsese Scorsese was directing it. Scorsese = classic Overall Goodfellas is really a film to have.
24786,False,"When Martin Scorsese is at his best, no one can do a gangster movie like him, and ""Goodfellas"" is him at his best.Mind you, I don't think it's his best film (for me, that title belongs to ""Taxi Driver""), but it's a hugely entertaining and rollicking film that spends its first half making the world of mobsters look like an enticing fantasy and its second half making it look like a living hell. There are fierce performances from everyone, but though Joe Pesci was singled out for his outrageous depiction of the ultimate hot head, the film would not hold together without Ray Liotta's commanding performance at its center. Lorraine Bracco's performance as a naive dense wife who turns into an enraged shrew of a wife is like nails on a chalkboard, but I'm guessing she delivered exactly what was asked of her.The film features rapid fire editing and a soundtrack that won't quit, but in the hands of Scorsese, elements like this feel like more than empty stylistics.Grade: A"
24787,False,"The best mobster film in my opinion. I love the Godfather but this is just so much more fun to watch. When I mean fun I mean I can't take my eyes off this fn thing every time it comes on or someone's watching it. If there is one movie that never ever ever ever gets boring i would have to say that it's these guys the Goodfellas you know. There's nothing to really say about this film i mean you just have to see it, I'm just writing 'cause I want the score to show up on MY MOVIES over here. It's entertainment at it's very best. You want a true story Goodfellas, you want crime Goodfellas, you want clever jokes still Goodfellas. The only downside is, after watching this film, you really get this urge to join the mafia and live a life of crime, you know, be a Goodfella."
24788,False,"Martin Scorsese's name under a movie is far beyond enough to watch it without asking further questions.But imagine a kind-of-modern gangster movie starring world's pioneer actors ""Robert de niro"" and ""Joe pesci"" and others such as ""ray liotta"" and ""paul sorvino"" gathering all together with martin Scorsese who is undoubtedly master of gangster genre and dialogs (one of the reasons why Joe pesci won an Oscar for his performance)to make- in my opinion -the best gangster movie ever produced in the history of Hollywood. Apart from performances which are excessively good! it has a very powerful and smooth story and screen play ,easy to follow (unlike miller's crossing or once upon a time in America) that keep you glued to your seat all the way to the end. i'd like to recommend this masterpiece to every one who is not only in favor of gangster genre but also mesmerized by the world of movies and movie making"
24789,False,"This is Scorsese's masterpiece. Thought of by many as his best film ever, i can see why. The film based on Pileggi's book about Henry Hill (Liotta) and his buddies Jimmy Conway and Tommy De Vito's quest to move up the mob hierarchy as they commit a robbery and then start to kill people involved in it. Henry seems to be having a great time but is affected negatively both in his personal and business life because of his two lose cannon friends. Scorsese does a brilliant job adapting this to the screen and produces one of the best directed and written films ever with Goodfellas. With amazing cinematography from Michael Ballhaus, and very good editing from Thelma Schoonmaker and James Y Kwei, this film is a classic and one of my favorite films of all time.IMDb Rating: 8.8. My Rating: 10/10"
24790,False,"Goodfellas is one of my favourite films and is my second favourite Martin Scorsese film (Raging Bull is my first). This is one of the first modern gangster films that look at the working class/file and rank members of the Mafia, compared to films like the Godfather which looked at the upper ranks.Goodfellas is based on the book Wise Guys, an autobiographical account by Henry Hill, a former member of the Mafia. The film looks at rise in the ranks from a 14-year-old boy to becoming a successful member, making money and becoming happily married to spells in prison and leaving the Mafia. The film looks at the working of the crime organisation, but also looks at Hill's (Ray Liotta (easily his best film)) personal life, such as his courting of Karen (Lorraine Bracco), from an unsuccessful double date to marriage. It looks at his relationships with other Mafia members and how they work together and act like a family themselves. It does not show the Mafia as either good or evil, even thought they do bad things, and makes the character human. Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), is well played as a psychopath and this film got Pesci an Oscar for best supporting actor. The casting is brilliant, as already mentioned this is Liotta's best performance, Robert De Niro is always good, so Joe Pesci and Bracco is good and she ends up in the Soparnos.This film is excellent and should have won more Oscars, especially best director. It has also been very influential in the gangster genre, from the Soparnos, to films like Donnie Brasco to Scorese own film Casino, and has been parodied in programs like the Simpsons and Futurama. Goodfellas is a must see movie."
24791,False,"I first watched GoodFellas about 2 years ago and the moment I saw the murder of Billy Batts within the opening couple of minutes I knew I was in for a treat. Robert De Niro plays Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway brilliantly. Joe Pesci also superbly plays the ruthless Tommy DeVito. In my opinion I think it is Martin Scorsese's best film. Im a big fan of Scorsese's choice of music to put in GoodFellas as I am a big fan of Eric Clapton, Cream & The Rolling Stones. Since I watched GoodFellas I have gone on to buy other Scorsese films such as Raging Bull, Casino, Taxi Driver & Gangs Of New York, But still without a doubt I think GoodFellas is better than all of those."
24792,False,"This is as close a thing to film making perfection as you are going to get in your lifetime. When I first saw this film several years ago I thought it was the greatest film I have ever seen, and I still believe that now.Goodfellas is the chronicling of the life and times of Henry Hill (Liotta) and his seedy underworld dealings with his dubious associates Jimmy Conway (De Niro) and Tommy De Vito (Pesci). It begins with with his entanglement with the mob, follows his rise to power and riches, then allows you to watch, as his whole carefully balanced life comes crashing down around him in spectacular fashion.What stands out for me about this film is that it does not rely on flashy special effects, extravagant pyrotechnics or a spot of the good old ultra violence (that said this film is by no means without violence), but it simply uses extraordinary story telling, a skill lost all too easily on most of modern cinema. It will suck you in right from the get go and grasp you to its greasy, mozzarella scented bosom right until the closing minutes when you are allowed to un-immerse yourself from the captivating portrayal of the life of a ""goodfella"".Scorsese has without doubt been one of the best and most consistent directors and film makers of all time, everything he touches seems to turn to wonderfully gritty, seedy, gold, but I believe this to be his Magnum Opus above all of his other films and accolades throughout his career. He has a method of presenting the gangster genre I have yet to see be surpassed in terms of sheer entertainment value and depth. He also brings out truly top drawer performances from some undoubtedly great actors across the whole spectrum of the cast. Only this truly great combination of this directing, acting, and not to mention the realistic and natural scripting, could culminate to make the viewer feel some sympathy (mixed with a small degree of satisfaction at Hills retribution) towards a murdering, coke snorting, cheating mobster and all round scum bag.This film also boasts the infamous ""You think I'm funny?"" scene with Pesci providing a truly incredible performance here in particular. In a matter of minutes Tommy's character is encapsulated in emphatic style providing a brilliantly suspenseful and humorous peek into his psyche.I would recommend this film to anyone that has not seen it already, and if you haven't, why the hell not?! It's been out for 18 bloody years go and buy the DVD now!"
24793,False,"As a teenager Henry Hill's (Ray Liotta) dream begins to come true when he lands a spot during jobs for a local mob. To him, things can only go up from this point and they do. For awhile anyway.Eventually he is turned into a certified member of the mob family. He gets married and starts a family all while working for the mob. He hangs out with many different characters from his mob family, including mob boss Paulie (Paul Sorvina), Jimmy (Robert De Niro), and Tommy (Joe Pesci). As time goes on, Henry comes across a few rough patches.This movie is just an amazing movie. I've never been really into mob movies, but this one is just too good to pass up. Everything is great, the acting, the writing, just everything.The movie has a great cast of characters, all with dramatically different personalities brought together by the mob. Henry is the type that can act both innocent and deadly at the same time. Tommy is a true off the wall psychopath with a crazy sense of humor. Jimmy is you're typical gangster who can go from your best friend to your worst enemy in the blink of an eye.Martin Scorsese is by far one of the most talented directors of our time and this is one of his finest pieces of work. It's worth watching even if you're not much into mobster movies. Although, if you just have a problem with violence or mobsters in general, pass this one up."
24794,False,"Another classic gangster movie,Goodfellas has a good ensemble cast,a good storyline to it and great acting and sort of sets the mold for future gangster movies such as Heat,The Departed and American Gangster.Directed brilliantly by Martin Scorsese who should have rightfully won Best Director for this movie,the movie tells the story of Henry Hill(Ray Liotta) who joins the mob at a young age and meets James""Jimmy"" Conway(movie legend Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito(Joe Pesci in his Oscar winning role) and is taken under the wing of Paul""Paulie"" Cicero(Paul Sorvino) who is a local mob boss.Also nominated for the Best Picture Oscar as well as Best Supporting Actress Oscar-Lorraine Bracco and Best Adapted Screenplay which Goodfellas should have rightfully won all of those Oscars but won Best Supporting Actor-Joe Pesci.Brilliant job by Martin Scorsese and the cast.A true gangster classic."
24795,False,"""Goodfellas"" is an exceptional mobster film, but not because of it's plot or script. It's a good plot, nothing too exceptional however, and the characters are pretty solid throughout, every one being a complete sleaze-ball. The performances are amazing. Ray Liotta is the main character and actually shows off his acting abilities best through his super slick narration throughout the film. Joe Pesci gives an outstanding supporting performance as the tough, wiseguy he plays in most movies, but for some reason it stands out here. Robert Deniro also gives an amazing(ly tough) and powerful performance. It's all about the cool direction and great acting for this film.Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) has always wanted to be a gangster ever since he was a young boy. We learn his background and how he gets caught up with the mobsters, from the good times to the bad. Two of his closest friends are Jimmy (Robert Deniro) and Tommy (Joe Pesci). Tommy (especially) goes crazy with power and eventually these three are working their way to the top of the mob standings.One problem with this movie is the lack of any soul or redeeming characters. The characters we are presented are interesting to listen to and follow, but we know each one is a violent criminal. Even movies like ""The Godfather"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" give us characters that if not redeeming, become somewhat redeeming by the end of the film and make us care about them. For all I cared, they could've massacred the entire cast of characters. I'd still have had a heck of a time watching them, as I did, they just weren't likable. Luckily, the most likable character is also the narrator and star of the film, Ray Liotta.Overall, this is a great mobster film, with some outstanding performances and snappy direction. However, the lack of any redeeming characters might annoy viewers who need at least one person to root for, though those people may find themselves rooting for the three main guys to murder to whole lot of them just for the entertainment value.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 145 mins. R for violence, drug use, sexuality, language."
24796,False,"This movie is about despicable characters committing deplorable acts yet it manages to be interesting if overlong, with too much time spent establishing the gangster lifestyle that we already know about from films such as ""The Godfather."" Once it gets going about half way through, however, it becomes rather compelling. Scorsese is the master of this sort of film, although his trademark obsession with violence is disturbing. De Niro plays the same character that he has played in a dozen movies. Although there are no likable characters, Pesci's is the worst. Bracco is sexy. Liotta is creepy-looking. This one probably holds the record for the number of f-words uttered."
24797,False,"This movie makes you want to be a gangster! Its's a dark, harsh film that actually manages to glorify gangsters. Director Martin Scorcese's obsession for the characters and the extraordinary lives they lead is truly demonstrated here.He shines throughout as he manages to entertain, and keep the audience interested, for over two hours. The book might be better, but ""GoodFellas"" is one Scorsese-De Niro collaboration in which De Niro is often not the most important person on screen when he is on screen. He's good, but Liotta is classic in the central role, a performance for the ages in fact, while Pesci made for a deserved Oscar recipient with the way he inhabits Tommy the walking Id and delivers ""GoodFellas"" message of how the good life isn't all that good, that there's always something rotten beneath the surface that will reach up and grab you at the wrong time.This movie should have been Martin Scorsese's best director Oscar. His directorial skills would never be better."
24798,False,"This is the best gangster movie that i have ever seen. It deserves its place in front of The Godfather. In fact this is much better then The Godfather.The reason this rises above the other gangster movies is that it is superior in every way. Its acting is superb and so believable that it looks like it is really happening to the actors.Based on a true story, it shows the rise and fall of gangster Henry Hill. It starts with Henry as a teenager and works it way up all the way to the end.The detail that has been put into this is amazing. It feels like you are taking a trip from the 50's all the way through to the late 80's.There is humor in there. Mainly the humor comes from Joe Pesci.Every actor did a great job. Robert De Niro is a very convincing gangster. Joe Pesci is hilarious as always. But the one that stole the show was Ray Liotta. He made me laugh, he made me angry. It was his best performance.There are some great tunes in there. After the movie i was singing a few of them.Goodfellas is not one for the kids. It has brutal violence and there are lots of scenes of drug use and there is lots of swearing. It really depends on how mature the child is. I recommend a minimum age of 12.I highly recommend this. This is a must see movie.My #1 gangster movie.10/10"
24799,False,"Goodfellas is just one of those movies. It has everything from great directing and acting to awesome music and memorable comic moments. In this case, the directing is by Scorsese and the acting by Deniro, Pesci and Liotta so its all superb. Throughout the movie you get the classic comedy that comes along with Joe Pesci and Robert Deniro and some great music to go along with all these great scenes. A lot of people claim that the godfather is the greatest movie of all time. To me, watching Goodfellas is just as engrossing but more fun to watch thanks to Pesci, Deniro and Liotta. Goodfellas is just one of those movies that movie critics can enjoy, but so can your average movie watcher."
24800,False,"Herny Hill (Christopher Serrone) grows up during the 1950's, who grows up in the neighborhood of New York City in the tough and roughest areas. But Herny becomes fascinated, when he's hired to do small time jobs for the local mob. Which Herny is certainly loyal and these Wiseguys do treat him with respect as well. When Herny becomes a man (Now Played by Ray Liotta), he becomes a small time gangster by doing various of jobs for them during the 1960's to the early 1980's. Herny becomes close with two friends, who are also in the mob. Well Respected Gangster James ""Jimmy"" Conway (Two Time Oscar-Winner:Robert DeNiro) and ambitious slightly crazy Wiseguy Tom DeVito (Oscar-Winner:Joe Pesci) are pulling off various successful jobs until the things aren't not what they used to be. Especially when the law are trying to find a way to put these mobsters in jail. Especially when these men are slowly falling apart.Directed by Oscar-Winner:Martin Scorsese (The Aviator, The Departed, Taxi Driver) made an entertaining Gangster film that is fast-paced, filled with vivid rich characters, often funny and violent movie. This is actually based on the life of the real Herny Hill. The real-life Hill once lived that dangerous life as it is shown in the film. Liotta gives an terrific performance here, which it is one of his best roles. Scorsese's scores a terrific supporting cast like DeNiro, Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino and more. Pesci won an Oscar for his brilliant violent comedic supporting role. Bracco also received an Oscar nomination for her strong supporting performance as well. It also received nomination for Best Picture, Best Editing, Best Director and Best Adapated Screenplay. This is one these pictures that becomes an Instant Classic like most of Scorsese's interesting movies and it also an rich soundtrack. Plenty of familiar faces appears in bit parts and cameos, especially the director's mother. ""Goodfellas"" is a extremely well directed movie that gets better and better with each viewing. Don't miss it. Based on a novel by Nicolas Pileggi (Casino). Screenplay by Pileggi and Scorsese. (**** ½/*****)."
24801,False,"i think this is the best gangsters movie ever. the actors are hand picked from the best, and if it warren for Robert De Niro the film wouldn't be the same, Robert De Niro is a must have in a gangsters movie. the language isn't censored in any way fact that added to the film's goodness. good work goodfellas ;) if only they would have made a sequel to it to, that would have been perfect wouldn't it. p.s. if you wanna see another good gangsters movie i recommend you casino ... Robert De Niro is the best!!;) and if you didn't see the film yet you don't know what your missing. Whit all the respect Alex from Romania:D Goodfellas rocks!!!"
24802,False,"The movie is Goodfellas. The geniuses who made it, Martin Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi. The outcome: Successful.Plot: (True story). Henry Hill and his two close mobster friends, Jimmy and Tommy become the huge players in the punk-like tiny Italian-American gangster community in New York at the time.List of main characters Henry Hill: The engine the movie runs on. Hill is Italian-American with Irish blood. Ray Liotta, in my eyes, then a newcomer, sets me at storm. His performance is top-notch and yet he looks like he doesn't care, this 'effortless' quality that Ray possess is great and exciting.Jimmy Conway: De Niro's character is the at times sick, at times bubbly. This is a character with no set behavior pattern. De Niro catches it with great attitude.Tommy DeVito: Joe Pesci's character swears and kills people with his gun as ignorantly as taking a cookie out of jar. He kills people willingly and when they make him mad for the simplest reason. An amazing, entertaining work.Paul Cicero: ""Paulie"" is the one man who gives protection to wiseguys from law enforcement. So in return, he gets a part of the wiseguys' share and their respect as well. On the DVD, Paul Sorvino claims he found the quality that his character needed in his eyes when he went to the mirror to check for spinach in his teeth. (lol..) Karen Hill: The wife of Henry Hill. She's a very naive-like woman but grows depressed and frustrated with Henry towards the end. She is innocent and is unaware of Henry's affairs with Janice Rozzi and Sandy, who participates in Henry's drug business in the movie.Martin Scorsese melds amazing little things together in this movie that form a masterpiece. Frankly, I never thought the piano part of Derek And The Dominos' LAYLA would fit in a mobster movie. Indeed, it was one of the many reasons why only Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is the only movie that is greater than this one. A must-see.8/10: A-"
24803,False,"""Goodfellas"" is Martin Scorsese's movie about Henry Hill, who aspires to be a gangster from an early age and becomes involved with an Italian-American crime family over three decades. The film features interesting and effective cinematography and it was notable how the shots were filmed in the ""drugs"" portion of the film. The soundtrack featured a number of notable songs like the end of ""Layla"" and ""Jump Into the Fire"".The performances in this film are top-notch. Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill effectively as he lives with the perks and dangers of mob life. Robert De Niro delivers an interesting and refined performance as Jimmy Conway. Joe Pesci is memorable as the erratic and disturbing Tommy DeVito. Lorraine Bracco is also commendable as Henry's wife and Paul Sorvino makes a convincing mob boss.This film develops an interesting story with surprising and interesting developments that keep the film well-paced. It explores the tightly contained lives of the members of the mob family. In addition, it has an interesting examination of the privileges afforded to the mob and the consequences of the mob's power. Also explored are the implications of mob life for Henry's relationship with his wife. ""Goodfellas"" is an exceptional entry into the crime film genre."
24804,False,"Goodfellas has to be the greatest mob movie.from it's memorable characters to the excellent plot that is called a classic.he're is why it is called a classic.The movie is focused on Henry Hill(Ray Liotta)who when he was young he wanted to become a gangster and he becomes one from the mob by doing thing like selling cigarettes,Blowing up cars,delivering packages,etc.soon enough he meets Jimmy Conway(Robert De Niro).who becomes friends with Henry helps him when he's on one of his jobs.soon enough Tommy Devito(Joe Pesci)comes into Henry's life and become friend but unlike Henry.Tommy was more violent than Jimmy and Henry put together.Henry even though at first he enjoys the mob life but evenutally Henry's mob life goes upside down and bad things start to happened to him.This movie has a good plot with memorable character at the same time Great performances.Robert De Niro who plays Jimmy ""the Gent"" Conway give a great performance he really watches out for Tommy and Henry and proves he can still be dangerous.Joe Pesci gives the best performance he plays the violent Tommy Devito.who loves hurting people and gets a laugh a hurting other for example the scene where the guys are playing poker Tommy gets into a fight with a bartender and shoots him in the foot.then the next time they play poker again he starts to insult him but the bartender defense himself and Jimmy gives the bartender gives him props from insulting Tommy he asks Tommy what's he's going to do Tommy pulls his gun and shoots and kills the bartender.In some way you got to hate Tommy but at time you got to love him.Ray Liotta who Henry Hill even though he's the main character and gives a solid performance but nothing really memorable maybe it was that at the time Ray Liotta wasn't an experience actor but he does a good job playing Henry Hill.Lorraine Bracco who plays Karen Hill Henry tormented Wife is more memorable than Henry with her paranoia of her husband cheating at her but the best scene where she really shines is when she loads a gun at threatens to Kill Henry but can't because she still loves Henry and she pulls it off well and making her role believable.as for the rest of the characters even though there not defiled like the main characters they still give a good job with what there given.Still if you haven't seen this movie go get it it's a special movie."
24805,False,"""Goodfellas"" is a superb movie presenting an amoral and very real-seeming portrait of the Mafia. Where ""The Godfather"" limits itself to a sepia palette and a somber tone, ""Goodfellas"" is brash, busy, and captures both the humor and the horror of a mobster's life. Nor do the Goodfellas pretend to have noble motivations. Instead, they're a bunch of power-hungry guys who band together for protection but double-cross each other at the first opportunity. Many admit to a compulsive love for crime, including robber Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and, especially, the unhinged, trigger-happy Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci).Tommy and Jimmy are the closest associates of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), the movie's narrator and main character: all are mid-level mob guys who start out around the same time. Henry is half-Irish, so he knows that the Mafia will never fully welcome him. This outsider quality complicates his personality and makes him an ideal narrator.""Goodfellas"" runs on style and atmosphere rather than a linear plot. The first hour culminating in the famous long-take at the Copacabana nightclubshows the glamorous appeal of the mob lifestyle for young Henry. It's the Rat Pack early sixties, and America and the mob are still somehow innocent. As we follow Henry into the late sixties and beyond, the mob becomes more insular and a parody of what it once was. The women have tacky outfits and hard-edged faces; the men's crimes get bigger. Henry gets involved in drug dealing, and his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco) turns from a tough-but-sweet Jewish girl into a full- fledged Mafia wife.The best part of the movie is the virtuoso, suspenseful, darkly funny sequence (it could almost stand on its own as a short film) where Henry's responsibilities as mobster and family man threaten to overwhelm him. In the course of a single day, he must keep his drug smuggling, mafia connections, large extended family, and mistress under control, while trying to evade a helicopter that seems to be following him. The editing and music perfectly recreate Henry's jittery, cocaine-fueled paranoia. Indeed, ""Goodfellas"" has probably the best compilation soundtrack that I've ever heard: each song perfectly fits.There is always so much going on at once in ""Goodfellas""music, narration, dialogue, camera movements and imagesthat boredom is not an option and dazzling moments come frequently. And its ambivalent moral perspective (should we love these men and their lifestyle, or hate them?) gives you something to think about after the pop songs and shootings have ended."
24806,False,"What a wonderful inspiring film-making by the only director who could possible make the film, the undisputed classic. The cast is superb, the pace - incredible; 145 minutes simply flew by. My beloved ""Sopranos"", all six seasons of it could fit perfectly like in a case in these 145 minutes. Ultra-violent, mesmerizing, enthralling, ""GoodFellas"" is an unforgettable wild ride. I have not seen the film for a while and what a great fun it was to re-watch it again and I know it always will be.Favorite scene - after Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) killed Billy Batts, they and Henry Hill stopped at Tommy's mother (Mrs. Scorsese) house. The contrast between earlier horrifying scene at the bar and the nice family dinner is simply breathtaking."
24807,False,"Goodfellas to me is not only the best film of 1990 and a milestone of 90s' cinema, but also a fine learning experience of the ins-and-outs of mob life from it's own words: Henry Hills personification of real life former gangster Henry Hill is every bit as down to the book as Robert Deniros' relentless portrayal of boxer Jake Lamotta in the preceding(by 10 years!)classic Raging Bull. But Hill is not alone on this one along with the returning Scorsese vets Deniro as mobster anarchist Jimmy Conway and Joe Pesci as Jimmy's colorful, psychotic left hand man Tommy Devito-whom of which Pesci deservedly won an Oscar for best supporting actor. Add to that stunning performances by Paul Sorvino and Laurine Bracko(plus a surprising small appearance of Pulp Fiction-star-but-then-new-guy Samual L Jackson)and you have a cast for the ages.Performances aside, this film probably gets closer to the mob world then long winded epics like the Godfather or any other on screen depiction of the sort. It's more like a documentary then an actual movie. And I urge fans and first-time viewers to pick up the special edition DVD which features audio commentary from the real Henry Hill and one of the witness protection officers(whom also makes a cameo in the film), among a hole lot of other extras.What Scorsese has created here is simply put: visual mob literature. A true masterpiece among the Scorsese catalog."
24808,False,"This movie should have been Martin Scorsese's best director Oscar. His directorial skills would never be better. During the scene in the restaurant around the table, Scorsese puts you at that table with all the wise guys. You feel like you are there. An fine example of some of the best directing in film history. Instead they gave the Oscar to first time director Kevin Costner for Dances with Wolves. You tell me which movie will be remembered in another 10 years. Anyway this true story of Henry Hill runs like the cocaine fueled Henry Hill. It accelerates you to the end and then suddenly you are cut off. Amazing. De Niro, Liotta, Pesci, Bracco and Sorvino all give top notch performances. Pesci was never better than this movie. This is a true work of art that will always be considered to be a great movie."
24809,False,"The more time passes, the better ""GoodFellas"" looks.A decades-long examination of the Mafia lifestyle as seen through the eyes of minor Brooklyn hoodlum Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), whose secret to survival involves keeping quiet, ""GoodFellas"" puts you in the back seat watching with Henry as his pals steal, rob, burn, and kill each other off. One thing about living the good life is that it's never good enough. As Henry and wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco) partake more in the money, they also become more exposed to the danger.That's really the core of the story, though it's probable if you haven't seen ""GoodFellas"" you think more of it as the one where Henry's temperamental friend Tommy (Joe Pesci) wants to know why you find him so amusing.""GoodFellas"" is an amusing film, very much so at times, yet like with Tommy there's always a barb that comes with the laughter, and makes for a deeper overall experience. Director Martin Scorsese and co-screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi, who wrote the source book ""Wiseguy,"" capture not only the violence but the lifestyle that undergirds and enables the violence, often in finely detailed and witty ways, like when Karen meets the other Mob wives and discovers their penchant for double-knits and beating their sons with broom handles.Other organized-crime films either excuse the lifestyle in a relativistic way (""Godfather"") or pump up the volume to an absurd degree (1983's ""Scarface"") in order to sensationalize and glamorize the experience. ""GoodFellas,"" despite its bad-boy reputation, is really on the side of the angels, out to expose the vileness of Mafia living, people who kill each other over nothing and betray each other over nickles and dimes. It's hard to see Scorsese's claims of detesting violence in some of his other films, like ""Gangs Of New York"" and ""Casino,"" because he goes to it so often there, but here you meet the people before you see what happens to them, reducing the pleasure of their demise, while the killings are quick and dirty, not exploited for cheap effect.That and it's so damn entertaining. Scorsese puts on a clinic, one that is still ongoing, with his use of music, tracking shots, and slam-the-door editing, like when we still hear Karen crying from one scene while Henry and his pals walk through a door to start the next. Even when you watch this film again (and you sort of have to, there's so much to take in) you aren't bored because there's always some new thing to attract your attention.The character of Jimmy the Gent (Robert De Niro) is a little confusing in the film, especially when he helps crazy Tommy whack a guy he should know better about. The book explains this better, but ""GoodFellas"" is one Scorsese-De Niro collaboration in which De Niro is often not the most important person on screen when he is on screen. He's good, but Liotta is classic in the central role, a performance for the ages in fact, while Pesci made for a deserved Oscar recipient with the way he inhabits Tommy the walking Id and delivers ""GoodFellas"" message of how the good life isn't all that good, that there's always something rotten beneath the surface that will reach up and grab you at the wrong time."
24810,False,"In my mind this is the second best movie ever made after One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. Most people would argue that the Godfather 1 and 2 are the better mob movies. I must admit that the afformentioned movies are also brilliant and deserve to be in the top ten. I think the things that sways me towards Goodfellas are number 1, the dark sense of humour this movie imbues. The tone of the Godfather's can be much too serious at times. Just because it,s a serious drama doesn,t mean thers's no room for a little levity at times. This movie moves along quite nicely,while the Godfather gets a little bogged down at times....especially the wedding scene which in my mind was about ten minutes too long. Both movies had brilliant direction and performances....i guess i'll call that one a draw. If you like this one check out Casino. It's not as good as Goodfellas or the Godfather's but still very deserving of a viewing. Other mob recomendations are Miller,s Crossing, the Untouchables, Once Upon a Time in America, Scar Face and the Godfather Part 3, yes i just said that."
24811,False,"A modern classic by a great director! Ray Liotta's best film by far and an academy award performance by Joe Pesce. DeNiro is awesome. Based on a true story that shows the cut throat seamy side of the underworld. I cannot believe how many young adults have not seen this film. A must see for anyone who loves film. One of the top 10 on my list along with The Seven Samurai, Rashomon, The Godfather 1&2, Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, The Matrix, Raging Bull, Heat and JFK. Goodfellas portrays gangsters and their wives in a realistic, low life, street level manner that is the opposite of The Godfather which romanticizes the genre. Although Goodfellas is a drama of the highest order it has many memorable comedic moments. The characters are richly detailed through the narration of Ray Liotta as Henry Hill and we see the dog eat dog survival lifestyle."
24812,False,"this is one of the best mafia movies ever.....truly !this movie has a great picture ,great music,great actors every thing u can imagine on a gangster movie this movie has it!!!good-fellas is a story about a boy that grown up between a lot of mafia guys and when he was like 25 wears old who becomes a great mafia guy he learns about respect,life and most important of all death he killed a lot of guys to be the most fearless guy known in the history of the united states of America...... i like the drama has a very good drama Robert DE niro is one of the best actors and this role was one of the most important in his life I'm sure about it.this movie is awesome"
24813,False,"This is one of the most impressive movies I've seen at the film-making level. I'm extremely interested in the way directors build films as audiovisual evocative worlds with specific rules, more than I am in the actual stories told, so of course I enjoyed this immensely.I can see the influence this film had on many directors, sadly the style elements that were borrowed from it (mainly the editing/score style) have been very badly executed most of the time. Strangely, I think that only french directors Gaspard Noé (in ""Carne"" and ""Seul contre tous"") and Jean-Pierre Jeunet (in ""Delicatessen"" and ""Amélie"") could pull off effective cinematic works with these editing/score structures. Since then, in mainstream cinema, these elements have mostly degenerated in a derivative mannerism without any power. Sad.Yeah, I definitely enjoyed the ride, and took good note of many fantastic cinematic devices, some great subtext (food as philosophy, almost as a character)... but still I have complaints.The first one is De Niro. Sorry but when I see him here, I still see an actor, not a character. I can take this when the movie takes a strong self-referential stance, deliberately using actors as actors, like in ""Jackie Brown"" or ""Brazil"" where De Niro fits perfectly. But here it doesn't work for me, I found it distracting (""hey, look, it's De Niro!"").The second one is the root substance. These mob operas generally are entertaining, but have a very shallow philosophy, follow very strict narrative conventions and don't have much to offer as culture. I even find them rather questionable as role models for adolescents.So what we have here is brilliant thanks to the director, and the director only. Even at the acting level: yes they're good, but their acting alone wouldn't have such power showed if Scorcese had not used them as a Chess Master, moving pieces on the board.Shallow substance, but very intelligent movie-making with power, wit and imagination. Enthralling. So much so that it's only when the movie is over that one (possibly) realizes that something is missing. A tour-de-force."
24814,False,"What this film did was bring into the mainstream a life that was always rumoured about. The Godfather probably accurately depicted ""the old firm"", while Goodfellas showed us the life in a more contemporary light.It is a great film. A life's tale of not only one man, but the Mafia as we may or may not know it today. It was Sopranos before that show ever got conceived. Plus the Sopranos just borrowed all their actors! This film has everything, depicting a time that our grandparents discuss with a tear of happiness. It is a great example of what makes us love the anti-hero, something mafia films always make us do. The characters are funny, ruthless, intimidating and I feel non-stereotypical..."
24815,False,"And yet the ending felt like a copout, an anticlimactic way for the filmmakers to get out of coming up with something better. This movie deserved a great ending, and it got a quick job instead. But maybe that's as it should be. Maybe there was no better way to end this incredible movie. It's a true story, so obviously the movie had to end a certain way. However, considering the talent involved, you'd expect something more.But however much I didn't like the ending was a quarter of how much I liked the rest of the movie. Maybe this isn't how the mob actually works, but the way Martin Scorcese films it seems about as realistic as a movie could get. The narrator takes us into the inner workings of the mob, explaining how everything is done and what everyone's job is. Of course, that would mean nothing without good characters, and the main character, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), is a great one. Not a great person, mind you; he's wanted to be in the mob all his life and the movie chronicles all sorts of nasty things he and his colleagues do to other people. But the character is great, partially because Liotta is so magnetizing. One of my friends thinks Liotta is the worst in the movie, but I don't think so. We see everything from his perspective, so we actually don't see a whole lot of him. But when we do, the movie is on.Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro give good performances as Hill's best friends, and Pesci deserved his Oscar for being a hothead that causes the mob a lot of trouble. But I really think Liotta takes the best performance in the movie and his was definitely an underrated one. Lorraine Bracco is also effective and versatile as Hill's wife. The two of them are more than convincing from beginning to end and the movie would not be the same without them.Martin Scorcese has made a brilliant movie, never boring, always alive. He's obviously a master director, but that darn endingmaybe the next time I see the movie the ending won't bug me so much. Maybe I'm overreacting. I certainly wouldn't want my qualms about the resolution to keep anyone from seeing such an incredible film."
24816,False,"An incredible movie by none other than Martin Scorsese is, as you would have to have guessed, this one. Though, not as good as the first two parts of the Godfather, still in that are. With amazing cast, story (based on true events), and direction makes a wonderful viewing experience.Though I do have a little bit of a thing for the string violence and intense situations, that doesn't necessarily mean this isn't enjoyable for everyone else. By the contrary! No, this can be enjoyed by anyone who doesn't mind:A). Violence (against wife, and others, resulting half the time in death). B). Drugs (in the last hour, but still...). C). language (and LOTS of it; the Trivia says the 'F' word is used 246 times).Other than THAT, it's not too bad. One of the best movies I've ever seen.Rating: **** (of 4)Entertainment: ***** (of 5)"
24817,False,"The best movie ever made. MARTIN SCORCE will never top this movie.IT Doesn't Get Any Better Then This. It Is a movie You Will Never stop Thinking About. The background music has a lot of meaning.It really makes you experience whats going on.When you finally get to see the real Henry Hill in real life its kind of disappointing. He really looks like and acts like Maury the wig man on the show.You have to give him credit ,only someone who lived through could come up with a story like this. this is a movie for young adults all the way to old people. This is the best movie ever,I only had to buy it at least 8 times-this time I wrote my name on it!"
24818,False,"A lot of people think that scarface and the Godfather are the best mafia-movies ever, but to me the best mob-movie would definitely be Goodfellas...by far! Just as in the earlier ""Once upon a time in America"" and the later ""Casino"", Joe Pesci and Robert deNiro play splendidly. Although it is a very long movie it never seems to bore and the director took enough time to describe the characters. Great acting, great story line, great characters, a lot of action, based on a true story...these are just some of the ingredients that make Goodfellas the best mafia movie ever in my opinion. It shows some similarities to ""Once upon a time in America"" (not only because of Pesci & deNiro), but where ""once upon a time in America"" was rather slow Goodfellas is filled with more action and there are more characters that are interconnected. People who love ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Godfather"" will definitely love this movie! It describes the rituals and macho culture of the mob superbly"
24819,False,"This is a really, really good Mafia movie. This movie ranks right up there close with the Godfather movies. I think this movie actually seemed a little more realistic than the Godfather. But don't get me wrong, it's still no Godfather. De Niro, Pesci, and Liotta were all great. Every time I see Pesci I think Mafia stooge; that's just the way he comes off in all his movies. He plays his role to perfection. He definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. De Niro was fantastic too, although this wasn't the normal role he plays. He was still a tough guy in this movie, but he was really paranoid throughout the whole thing. Every time I saw him on screen I could tell how badly he wanted in ""the family"", so he played that part perfectly. If the Godfather movies had never been made, then this would be the top Mafia movie out there."
24820,False,"I would have to say this is the greatest gangster film of all time. I love the godfather 1 and 2 and most other top mafia films such as casino, scarface, once upon. just my opinion but this has got to be up there with most film fans favourites. To have three stars like Liotta, Pesci and de niro produce their best work, (first two mainly} just shows the caliber of the film. If you look at the other contenders, Brando was the star in a great film, Pacino was, also as montana, but they carried those two films in my opinion. I may be biased as i think de niro is the greatest actor of all time but there you go. Let me know what you think and any other films that i may not have seen."
24821,False,"I feel about this movie the way I feel about all Scorcese films; my one controversial contention is that they lack heart. They are so well executed, virtuosic, precise, controlled, and at the same time, a little exuberant. Still, they lack heart. Have you ever seen deep parts of yourself in his characters or in his worlds, have you ever recognized, as one might, in the look of a Wes Anderson film, or even in the playful inventiveness of Back to the Future, a world that feels new and familiar at the same time, particular and general, some world or situation or feeling that you feel has been in you forever though you're only recognizing it now. Do you feel deeply about any of them? Simply put, do they move you? Perhaps an answer of 'No' to these questions does not indicate a deficiency. But out of the best works of art I want that phenomenon of meeting myself in something separate from me, a new and yet familiar part of myself, that sense of expansion, that presentiment of a mysterious and universal beauty. Given that, though, I do not hesitate to say that Scorcese's films are compelling, and furthermore, that Goodfellas ranks high among them. I am involved in its story easily and always when I run across it on TV. Just remembering the cocaine helicopter pasta sauce sequence makes me think well of the movie."
24822,False,"I absolutely love this film. I saw it a few years back for the first time and remember loving it immediately but it has taken several recent viewings for me to truly realise how much class the film actually contains. Be it Scorcesses stunning direction that really places the audience into this audacious lifestyle or the casts consistently note perfect performances. Although both Deniro and Liotta are brilliant it is Pesci that is the real don in this mafioso pic. It is a true testament to his abilities that you begin to laugh with this brutal murderer, a man who in one of the films most powerful moments murders an innocent man for the fear of losing some of the macho image that a lot of this lifestyle is built on. A hilarious, powerful and ultimately fascinating modern classic."
24823,False,"I have never been a die-hard fan of Martin Scorsese, but ""Goodfellas"" astounded me. It avoids the generic form of a gangster film by diving into areas where previous mafia films haven't. From drug dealing and the Witness Protection Program, ""Goodfellas"" separates itself from the generic template of a gangster film.GoodFellas starts off with a flashback by giving the background of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and how he became associated with the mafia as a teenager. In this flashback, we become learned of his connections and ties all over the place that will eventually help later on in the movie. While many flashbacks in different films are unneeded, this one isn't vital to the story, it connects things together, but it's also fun to watch.When we reach the 1960's, we meet Karen (Lorraine Bracco), the future wife of Hill it becomes an even better ride. Karen isn't seen much in the first thirty five minutes of the film, but once the camera pans on her, it's a pity when it isn't. Bracco's Karen is the strongest performance in the film which could have easily won her an Oscar. Without Karen, there would be no ""Goodfellas."" She is the backbone of this movie, and without a doubt, makes this movie what it is today.As established in the flashback, we see how Henry becomes associated with Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and their ring of crime. While there are not enough words to even begin to describe the accomplishments of the trio, from Henry's drug business to Tommy and Jimmy's heist and hits, these scenes are a joy to watch with no place to become boards.With excellent direction by Martin Scorcese, we see the director's nostalgic side of film-making as ""Goodfellas"" is basically a two and half hour long homage to the 1950's and 1960's music and culture. We see the characters become engrossed in the pop culture of the era up until the eighties when Jimmy is incarcerated after Henry becomes a rat for the police to avoid jail time.There is no boring scene in this masterpiece. Everything is crystal clear and the script is quick, witty, and profane. This movie is highly recomendable and is a movie for those who love gangster films and for those who love cinema in general."
24824,False,"Goodfellas is without a doubt the best mob movie ever, far superior to any of the Godfather movies. *gasp* No, the Godfather is not the holy grail of movies that some people seem so intent to think that it is. Goodfellas tells a better story and does so with infinitely more style. Martin Scorsese is the best director in American history and Goodfellas is the greatest of his works. It uses music as well as any other movie. The performances are very solid - Pesci and Liotta are as good as they have ever been and De Niro is unspectacularly perfect, as we all have come to expect. Bracco is good enough and Sorvino is flawless. Goodfellas, likewise, is flawless. It does everything that it does as well as it possibly could. The Godfather is considered a greater work only by stubborn old timers who have been saying ""the greatest movie ever made"" in a Brando accent for 30 years. An average rating of 8.6 just doesn't make sense. If you've seen this movie and didn't give it at least a 9, you're either intentionally messing up the rankings, biased, or maybe incapable of understanding the messages sent by Goodfellas."
24825,False,"I come back to watching this film every few years and each time I watch it, it gets better and better. This was Martin Scorsese at his best. You can debate all you want about his early films, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets... they don't hold up to this one. It's as if Scorsese's got everything rolling on this one - seamless editing transitions, intelligent use of soundtrack, clever camera work, sharp script, nuanced acting ... this film had everything he had to give.In many ways, it makes me kinda sad to see how the quality of so many of Scorsese's films have tanked since. Oh, the critics will love the movie he churns out every now and then but really they usually stink.(I mean, films like Kundun - big yawner, Gangs of New York - a documentary disguised as a fiction film, Age of Innocence - enervating drama of manners) Casino is probably the only exception - it's a decent film. It's frightening how a director can slide downhill so fast.So, enjoy this film if you can. Rent it. Buy it. Watch it. Re-watch it. You'll not see a better Scorsese film."
24826,False,"The remarkable true story of Henry Hill and the crime family to which he associates, paints a true picture of life in the mob. A fantastic transformation of book to screen, directed in excellent fashion by Scorcese; while sticking in great detail to the story of Henry Hill's narratated book Wise Guy.The casting for this film was perfect. Joe Pesci as Tommy put in an amazing performance and won the films only Oscar as Best supporting actor. Robert De Niro put a top performance in as Irish borderline psycho hustler Jimmy Conway and Ray Liotta put a career marking performance as leading character Henry Hill. The supporting cast was excellent also in a film with every day believable characters all the while, despite the world they were in.The film starts off with Henry as a young kid, desperate to be a gangster like the mob guys on his street, in a neighbourhood of 'schmucks' in Long Island. Henry hustles his way into the money, which he passes up to his mob boss protector Paulie. The money he scams gives him respect on the street but he can never be a made guy because of his Irish father. The first hour of the film is a tale of the great life they were living but as is the way in organised crime it can't last and they ultimately lead to their own downfall through excess and greed; something that emphasised the times, from the late 60s and 70s setting.It's a landmark in directing as freeze frames, pauses, a lack of continuity at times, a forward premonition at the start and a great scene where Henry and his then girlfriend Karen enter the Copa through the back door. It's stylish but unlike say with Tarantino in Pulp Fiction it's done in a gritty sense, rather than just for show. The film leads you into thinking that although the gangster life is great while it lasts, it's an empty world where you can be whacked at anytime for anything by your supposed best friend."
24827,False,"this movie as a true gangsta classic it has everything in it the story line is amazing the acting is amazing and the directing is amazing if you like gangsta or mob movies go see this one its has an amazing cast as well and best of all its a true story when i first saw this i was sick and i was bored to so i saw goodfellas laying around so i turned it on a first i thought i would be boring but no way it was awesome the first 10 mins got me so much into the movie i dident even wanna move so i sat there for three hours watching this amazing 148 minute film director Martin Scorsese does an amazing job Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino all do an amazing job as well thats why i gotta say this movie is a true gangsta classic."
24828,False,"Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci--their names say it all. De Niro and Pesci were iconography for 1980s gangster genre.Liotta plays Henry Hill--the main protagonist--who is seduced by life in the mafia; The film traces his humble beginnings as a runner-boy to his eventual rise to power. Guts, glory and power summarize the first half of the film.However, as it the film progress's, it gets bleaker and bleaker for Henry Hill as the price to pay for being in the mafia takes a toll on him.Clearly, Scorsese challenges the ideology that life in the mafia grants one power and glory--it sets up a direct contrast between mafia-power and the price to pay for that power. If the Godfather Trilogy glamorized the mafia, Goodfellas certainly deconstructs that glamor as the film progresses.The iconography is fantastic as it plays upon the usual mafia codes: flashy suits, cigars, nice cars and the actors themselves all serve to enhance the beautiful visual display of the gangster stereotypes used in the film.Brilliant, insightful and factual Goodfellas is a must see for any gangster-genre fan !"
24829,False,"This is one of those movies that you can give as a good example anytime you want to mention movie-making brilliance to anyone.""Goodfellas"" is a true gangster classic; a complete picture of the mafia and its operations. Comparisons to ""The Godfather"" movies are inevitable, but I shall say only this: both are great classics in their respective places and deal with separate stories; ""The Godfather"" movies are a riveting look at the goings-on in the life of the Corleone Crime family, while ""Goodfellas"" is a portrayal of the life of the mobsters who actually do all the jobs that some head of a crime family might want done! Also, ""Goodfellas"" has more of a ""jolly"" mood throughout the movie; you find yourself experiencing a feeling of triumph every time they pull off a job! ""The Godfather"" movies on the other hand have more of a somber atmosphere, enhanced by their sepia overtones, and topped off with a very serious and grave approach to story-telling.""Goodfellas"" is based on the true story of a young man named Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) who grows up to be a gangster in the company of other gangsters he has always admired! These include Jimmy (Robert De Niro), Tommy (Joe Pesci) and Paulie (Paul Sorvino).The movie takes an inside look at the operations carried out by the New York Mob. It also shows how Henry along with his partners Jimmy and Tommy, carries out a number of heists.All throughout the movie, these gangsters seem to be having complete fun, with things going their way all the time! It's only towards the end that things start to fall apart....There are some terrific scenes which have already gone down as classics and only get better with repeated viewings; there's some very witty and fantastic dialog (most of which is hogged by the brilliant Joe Pesci).Acting: Ray Liotta is great in the lead; but the best performances are by Robert De Niro (even though he has less screen presence), Joe Pesci (awesome, the way he mouths off the sharp dialog) and Paul Sorvino. Lorraine Bracco is superb as Henry's wife, Karen.Wonderfully directed, brilliantly acted, this thoroughly entertaining movie is a must-see! One of Martin Scorsese's best, along with ""Raging Bull""."
24830,False,"Good Fellas! Boy was that movie a dramatic movie. It was a great Mafia type movie, and it had an excellent movie plot to it. It was sad, intense but also kick ass! I loved it it was just so real and made you think deep. This movie was about coke dealers, and it really showed and taught the meaning of a coke dealer. It showed what the men had to go throguh, and how they dealth with their personal life. It was serouilsy pretty sweet. If you love the classic, mafia type, with a twist, then you will love Good Fellas. The acting wasn't too bad either. They prtrayed the characters really good and taught me all about the life of a smugler."
24831,False,"IMDb has been around, what, 8-9 years now? I'm sure many people have said better than me what is so great about Goodfellas. Ain't really nuttin' to say other than if I had maybe five pictures to take with me to a deserted island where I (somehow) had a DVD player, I'd definitely take this one. Joe Pesci in a lacerating, blistering performance of psychosis and self-hatred, Robert DeNiro playing a confident, psychotic, but also ambitious and highly- motivated Mafia hit-man. Paul Sorvino, radiating menace, Lorraine Bracco, particularly in her early scenes where she is intrigued and unsure what to make of up-and-coming don Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). One can sense her belief that perhaps she shouldn't be so entranced by him, but as she says after she hides the gun that Henry her, Some girls would be appalled, turned off, by such violence on their behalf but I found it a turn-on. The use of music in the film is wonderful, the cinematography, particularly in the edgy scene in January 1980 when...well, you know. and yeah, absolutely the best use ever (by a long shot) of voice-overs. Liotta's Hill is the apparently normal guy whose sympathetic narration give the film its connection to a supposedly reasonable person. The story is amazing, the acting is amazing, and the depiction of a Mob in which everything is not peachy keen for those making out like bandits (no pun intended) seems fair (not that I'd know....really..). Anyway, this film is right up there with The Godfather. I'd give it 20 out of 10 if I could."
24832,False,"30 yrs in the history of a mafia-career of one man (and his wife).A bunch of stars in one movie about a so called mafia family. Does this work ?Yes it does !It's very intense and shows between the lines the every day life of being in the ""familia"" with all its (dis-)advantages. Especially if things fall apart...The part I liked most is if the movie switches to female as the narrator. The most intensive part is during the seventies when drugs come into play.watch it and be stunned for hours."
24833,False,"# 1 Film of 1990There are numerous amounts of fantastic movies out there, but the special ones are few and far between. One of the most special motion pictures ever created was a film that combined brutal and painfully realistic violence, grittiness, a great composition of the music of 60s, 70s and 80s, a compelling storyline, authentic dialogue, incendiary narrative storytelling and a hell of a lot style. It was known as 'GoodFellas', veteran filmmaker Martin Scorsese's extraordinary mob film, that was a landmark in cinema because it superseded 'The Godfather', in my opinion. Many people agree 'GoodFellas' outranks 'Godfather' but many disagree also. In a nutshell, 'The Godfather' is what started it all, it's a stylish, super-cool Oscar-Winner with fantastic acting but 'GoodFellas' paints a more updated portrait of life in organized crime, and unlike 'Godfather' shows the severe consequences and results that come with being a 'wise guy'. 'GoodFellas' is an amazing movie that will no doubt impress you if you take the time to view it.The film begins with a grown-up Hill riding in a car with two other mob associates, the slick, cool and smooth spoken Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) and the psychopathic and violent mental midget Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci - in his Academy Award- winning role.) It's late at night and both look exhausted and they hear a thumping in the bank of the trunk and wonder what is going on. They pull of to the side of the road, open the trunk to reveal a older gentleman severely beaten up and bloody pleading, 'please, don't. please.' Tommy then takes a butcher knife and continues to aggressively stab him while Jimmy shoots him several times with a revolver. They close the trunk and the camera pans to Hill's face and he narrates, 'As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster.'. After that moment, viewing the rented DVD from Blockbuster, I knew I was in for a powerful, realistic, gritty but astonishing motion picture.The dark and beautifully shot feature 'GoodFellas' follows the true story of mob associate Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his rags-to-riches tale starting as a poor fresh-faced Irish-Italian kid in slums of Brooklyn running numbers for low-level hoods to working along side of major mob players. Hill was a boy obsessed with how the mafia worked and like most kids dreamed of being an astronaut, fireman, or president of the United States, he dreamed of being a wise guy. The movie then follows Hill's live in the mob until the 80s. I can't really tell you too much without giving the film away, but I can tell you he encounters interesting situations and the movie never ceases to be wild and entertaining. It's definitely the best mafia film ever made.There are many things to praise about Scorsese's most talked about motion picture 'GoodFellas'. First of all is the acting. All the performers, every one of them, are at the top of their game. Ray Liotta gives a strong performance as the film's narrator and main character, Henry Hill, while Robert DeNiro gives an absolutely riveting performance out-shining Liotta in almost every scene they share. It's a shame DeNiro wasn't nominated for an Oscar for the wonderful job he did in 'GoodFellas'. Lorraine Bracco impresses as Liotta's sassy but ultimately typical Italian-mob wife, while Joe Pesci is extraordinary and ferocious in his scene-stealing role as the blood-hungry and crazy paisan, Tommy DeVito, whom everyone is afraid of. Paul Sorvino rounds out the leading cast as the tough but quiet mob boss, while the film is packed with small roles played by such actors as Vincent Pastore, Tony Darrow, Mike Starr, Chuck Leow, Tony Sirico, Henny Youngman, Frank Vincent, Frank Sivero and Samuel L. Jackson. Martin Scorsese provides direction so brilliant you really can't put it into words, that should have won him the 'Best Director' Oscar at the 1991 Academy Awards Ceremony. Scorsese and Nicholas Pilleggi (who wrote the novel which 'GoodFellas' is based upon) provide one of the richest and finest screenplays ever created, and Thelma Schoonmaker provides marvelous editing.There are really no dull parts about this tough and brutal but beautiful and brilliant masterpiece from one of our generations best filmmakers, Martin Scorsese. If you haven't already and don't mind a little grit (actually a lot of grit) make it a mission to drive to Blockbuster and rent this movie on DVD. 'GoodFellas' is one of the best and most memorable films ever made. I think you'll enjoy it. Grade: AMADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT # 13"
24834,False,"This movie isn't light hearted its one of the best male movies ever with drugs violence and a glimpse of sex this movie has everything a man needs and don't forget the amazing teaming of De Niro Liotta and Pesci!!! if u liked this u should try movies like casino this also teams up De Niro pesci and director martin Scorseseif u like De niro or hard hitting mafia dramas u should try this one out not for the light heart though !!!!! if u liked the sopranos this is for u two actors from the show appear in this movie Lorraine Bracco and Michael Imperioli!!! this movie proves Pesci is a though guy even though his is tiny but is also funny !!!!!! De Niro is a good as ever and is also aggressive as in his other movies Raging Bull , The Untocuhables and The godfather 2"
24835,False,"If not better! This is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the 90's. I have to admit, I never paid much attention to gangster flicks until I saw this masterpiece. The movie is adapted from the book ""Wiseguy"" by Nicholas Pileggi, and I have to say, Scorsese did an excellent job. The movie tells the true story of Henry Hill(Ray Liotta) and his life in the mob. It tells about how he came into the mob, his troubled love life, and his relationship with his friends: The psycho Tommy DeVito(Joe Pesci) and the respected Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway(Robert DeNiro). The whole cast delivers excellent performances and the use of music in this movie is some of the best I've seen. The real Henry Hill once said that the portrayal of mob life in this movie is 99% accurate. I recommend this to not only mob movie lovers, but movie lovers in general!"
24836,False,"""as far back as i can remember i always wanted to be a gangster"".""The best mob movie ever"" that's what Saskel and Ebert say, and i couldn't be more agree, this is a real masterpiece, and after pulp fiction my favorite film ever.It's better than the Godfather because the Godfather only show us one aspect of the mafia, the power of the boss, Goodfellas in the other hand show us another part of the Mafia, the world in which mafia members live, their friendships, the betrayals, the way they think and act.This is the story of Henry Hill, a young man half Irish and half Italian who always wanted to be a gangster, for him being a gangster is just the life for him, he always act with his friends Jimmy (Robert De Niro), and Tommy De Vito Joe Pesci, but he can't be a higher member of the mafia because he's not completely Italian.This is definitely not only the best Scorsese film, but also a masterpiece of films of all times, Liotta as Henry Hill did it well, and of course De Niro was excellent as Jimmy Conway, but the best performance was Joe Pesci as Tommy De Vito, he definitely deserved the Oscar he won as best supporting actor. 10/10."
24837,False,"First of all Martin Scorsese is my favorite director. Second this is his best film in a big way. How the Academy missed him for Oscar here is a travesty. The film has an almost documentary feel to it early on. Love the intro of Ray Liotta's character and how he was sucked into the life of a gangster. The acting is top notch across the board (even the small roles). The food, the violence, the dark humor - carry the front of the film. Almost intoxicating the viewer to the glee of being a gang member till it is too late. When things go bad you realize there is no escape for Henry Hill from the life he chose. He will be killed or give it all up. From what I've read Henry Hill the man is hardly Henry Hill the character in this film, but that doesn't mean much as few know the real Henry Hill anyways. It isn't as though it was a biography of someone truly famous or important in history. It is the story of a petty criminal, turned drug addict, turned snitch that is done as well as any film ever."
24838,False,"Martin Scorsese has had a delicate career. I'm not saying he has had bad times as a director; I'm talking about his recognition as the pro he is. And I'm talking about the times he was overlooked, even with this movie, which is without doubt the best work he has done (or at least the best I've seen). I don't want to say what everyone says but we've seen Marty lost his Oscars with actors turned directors in those that for most people where his best movies. But many people waste a lot of time talking about those things; and I'm writing about ""Goodfellas"". Yes, that Scorsese movie that is so his as most of his projects are. That movie, one of the few directed by Scorsese that he also wrote, in collaboration with Nicholas Pileggi; who would write with him again for ""Casino"", a movie I haven't seen but I watched some parts and there's a clear parallel. In ""Casino"", it's a guy talking about how the casino works; the movement. The guy works in the casino. In ""Goodfellas"", it's a guy narrating his life as a gangster. He's a gangster, and if you don't realize at the beginning, it'll happen soon when he starts by: ""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster"". ""Goodfellas"" is based on a true story, about characters that really existed and could have had talks with the movie's main actors. There's an unusual magic in cinema when it comes to narration; and this is one of the first movies that dealt with that. Frank Darabont was having doubts as he was writing his first feature, based on a book, as ""Goodfellas"" is. He was writing and discovered he was using a lot of narration, he was afraid it wouldn't work. Only just then he sat and watched ""Goodfellas"" again, and probably again and again""The heck"", he must have said. ""This is pure narration"". Of course that movie is ""The Shawshank Redemption"", today a classic and personally one of my favorite scripts. When you experience main characters narrating the story, it's something unique. I've recently seen ""Paid in full"", where Ace, the main character, is telling a story. He takes us to the past once we saw a glance of the presents, and talks quietly and not so much so we can presence the story. This atmosphere came before with ""Goodfellas"", where Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) talks, after we see a brief glance in a time we'll see after. He introduces us to everyone and to his most united friends; Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). Henry's both friends are not telling the story; he is. So we know that no matter what, Henry won't be dead at the ending. He'll survive because he can't be telling the story from heaven; not when he stops and talks directly to the audience in some shots. In ""Paid in full"", Ace is a good man, and we want the best for him, because we know the persons around him and how they can influence him. He narrates the story; he's our hero. ""Goodfellas"" is another type of enchantment: where no hero exists; where we are just contemplating the story and not taking any sides. Is Henry the hero because he tells the story? No; neither Jimmy or Tommy. This is achieved by a wonderful script; trapping and palpable. As in ""Paid in full"", we get to know everyone: women (lovers or wives), who are always there for men. This is dealt with complexity, because some men have only lovers, but another are married and also need a company. The important wife role was in Lorraine Bracco's hands. Karen was in love of a violent and dangerous guy that was exciting because of what she turned into when being with him; and the future she predicted by his side. This is all correctly managed in Bracco's astonishing performance. We get to know the boss; that type of man knew in movies like ""The Godfather"". The man who doesn't talk to anyone personally, is calmed, and available when needed in extreme situations. He's Paul Cicero, played by Paul Sorvino, in a performance that compares silence with noise...In the business environment, people come and go, with short dialogues; and you understand who does what...It's all too big to be described.Ray Liotta carries with the weight of the movie somehow, in one of his ever best performances, adding original changes because of all the different transformations his character suffers. Joe Pesci, with one Oscar he'll always thank to Scorsese, steals the show with the movie's best lines and scenes in his hands. De Niro was already a pro at that time, butIt is something amazing to see him in any performance. He graces the screen with his way of talking, making each moment memorable; and that's one thing not many actors can't achieve. I didn't use to admire him as an actor; but I'm starting to realize, and Scorsese has a lot to do with that.With that and with everything, Marty is hidden behind every little detail in this film. Again, he puts his own visions into the screen, so you can see he's there. Sometimes his camera knows more than the storyteller; sometimes it knows nothing, and it really doesn't need toIt can be living the moment, or planning that violence Scorsese is always willing to release, just to mix it with the characters' deepest feelings. Scorsese, like Jimmy, Henry, Tommy or any other says; is a ""good fella"". ""He's with us, he's OK, you can hang out with him; he's a good fellaYou know?"". And his ""Goodfellas"" is another underrated cinematographic brilliance; as one of those all-time movie classics."
24839,False,"Goodfellas is one of the best mafia movies ever made! Ray Liotta deserved an Oscar for his performance of Henry Hill! Every scene that he's in is completely believable! Ray is an amazing actor and a great narrator too! The other cast members are great too! Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Paul Sorvino and Lorraine Bracco are great too! I also liked the music in this movie too! I would definitely recommend this movie to my friends and family! It is an exciting and entertaining movie! On a scale of one to ten with ten being excellent I'd give it a ten! Lorraine Bracco gives a very sassy and gutsy performance in her portrayal of Karen Hill"
24840,False,"Well I always liked Martin Scorcese movies, and probably during the late 80's and early 90's he made few of his very good movies.This one probably tops the list during that period.Well real life story,Deniro,Pesci, and surprisingly Ray doing very good for their roles really makes the movie one of the master pieces in this genre. Its about Henry and his life in the world of Mobs and Gsngsters and the people who help him to get to the top and eventually bring him down again.Definitive work on a real mob story.Well except for the running time of the movie really no complains on this movie.A definite 9/10....."
24841,False,"Do not miss this movie.Do not miss any Marty's movie.A wonderful saga about a mobster is a classic.Ray Liotta paints Henry Hills portrait and makes his ''lifetime'' role.Bobby De Niro is also great as Jimmy Mcway but the man that carry's the energy of the film is certainly Joe Pesci.His role of Tommy,an aggressive gangster won him a ''oscar'' for the best men supporting role.You almost want to take a picture of every scene and putt it on the wall.If you love Mafia based movies,you will love it.If you love Robert De Niro ,you will love it.Heck,if you love violence you will enjoy.Just watch and enjoy.A beautiful movie,that only Marty can make."
24842,False,"There is a fascination with the underworld that exists in everyone. We find ourselves drawn to the headlines of gang wars and those caught in the middle. After all, Al Copone was a crook, but also a celebrity. It is this fascination that has captivated audiences with gangster pictures from the 1930s with James Cagney in ""The Public Enemy"" to the more recent ""Goodfellas"" from director Martin Scorsese. The latter picture, with its sense of realism, like ""The Public Enemy"" stands the test of time. Its characters are every bit as terrifying, especially Tommy De Vito played by Joe Pesci as was Cagney's portrayal of Tom Powers. And of course with Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta, one can only expect explosive portrayals. ""Goodfellas"" tells the story of Henry Hill (Liotta), who from childhood had aspirations of being a gangster. He starts out small, parking Cadillacs for wise guys and eventually works his way up to top of the food chain. By the time he is 21, he has more money than anyone else does his age, a sexy girlfriend, and the respect of the mob. Henry soon teams up with Tommy De Vito (Pesci) and the two work the streets with Jimmy Conway (De Niro) for Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino). What begins, as robbery becomes another crime: murder, extortion, booze, etc. But after Henry gets married and finds himself rooted deeper into the mob, he begins to take on more than he can handle. Director Scorsese grew up on the streets of New York and witnessed the rough life that people could have. He incorporates his own history into the characters of the film. This is a common practice in most of his films from ""Raging Bull,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" and ""Mean Streets,"" as he has a fascination and love for the Big Apple. But the most obvious aspect of that life is the violence. It is portrayed in ""Goodfellas"" from a realistic point of view. Scorsese does not hide the blood. He does not hide way people die or where they may end up. He simply shows the gut-wrenching reality of the mob world as is. The most affective example of that realistic violence is Pesci's performance, which garnered him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in 1990. Tommy's character is a homicidal maniac, and a reminder of Cagney's performance in ""White Heat."" Pesci is horrifying to watch in action. From the opening scene where he stabs a body that is not quite dead, to his shooting of a young man named Spider who is slow to serve him a drink, the man is simply on fire. Pesci had a similar affect in ""Raging Bull."" As such, ""Goodfellas"" is Pesci's ""Raging Bull."" A scene in ""Raging Bull"" shows Pesci throwing a drink in a guy's face, then after a merciless beating, drags the guy out onto the street and repeatedly thrashes the man with a car door as the man's body lays half in the car and half outside it. The scene is horrific, but also enthralling. What is even more affective is Scorsese's use of music throughout the film. The time frame ranges from the 1960s to the late 1980s and the film's soundtrack plays like a time warp. The best use of music is Eric Clapton's ""Layla,"" in which Scorsese plays the song's last four minutesa piano and guitar duo that masterfully captures the feeling for the events in the film. Ultimately, ""Goodfellas"" is the equivalent of a mob-epic. Like the gangster pictures of the 1930s, there is also social commentaryit is the government that tries to crack down on these criminals, however, it is the police and other public sectors that are hand-in-hand with the moband little is ever done to change the situation. ****"
24843,False,"'Goodfellas', alongside 'Pulp Fiction' stands as my all time favorite film. Based on Nicolas Pillegi's outstanding novel the screenplay is intelligent and thrilling and gives credence to each performer. In crime movies the female leads (if any) are whiny and one dimensional but Lorraine Bracco's Oscar nominated perfromance is brilliant and her character is as dimensional as Henry (a slightly disappointing Ray Liotta, he rushes the voice-over and much of his dialogue). Jimmy (forget Raging Bull, this is DeNiro's greatest performance)Conway is pure genius and Pesci is great as the plain insane Tommy DeVito.Scorcese directs with a fast moving and in your face visual style and punctuates the soundtrack with some of the best rock/pop songs of the sixties and seventies, ending with Sid Viscous's 'My Way' was a stroke of genius and putting 'Down Below the Ocean' over the Batt's murder was insane but it worked because it goes against the grain.People say the Godfather is the greatest crime movie ever and perhaps they are right. But I have to disagree, 'Goodfellas' is more energetic more exciting and most importantly more FUN than the dreary, boring Godfather's.A flat out, awe inspiring, no-one will ever make a film as good as this again MASTERPIECE.10/10"
24844,False,"If it were not for The Godfather, this would be the best mob movie ever made. Ray Liotta as Henry Hill was fantastic. Joe Pesci plays the sickest SOB on the planet. I sometimes wonder if maybe he IS the sickest SOB on the planet. And DeNiro? He plays DeNiro. And NOBODY can play DeNiro the way he does. Paul Sorvino is the classic mob boss. And I know. I've represented these guys. And if you ever had second thoughts about Lorraine Bracco being a very hot looking woman and a great actress, look no further than this movie.If you haven't seen this film, make it a point to see it soon. If you have seen it, make it a point to see it again."
24845,False,"This is truly one of those movies that pull you into it and have you engrossed in it from beginning to end. The acting is superior and each the casting choices could not have been better made.This movie combines dark humor along with the cruel reality of what it is really like living in the world of the Mafia. What makes this movie even more riveting, is that fact that it is completely true. In fact, some of the actors in the movie play themselves such as some of the law enforcement people.If you want to know what being in the Mafia is REALLY like, then this is the movie you should watch. Joe Pesci plays one of the lead characters, who is outrageously funny and entertaining, and just when you start to think you might like and understand him, he pulls you back to the reality that he is a cold hearted murderer who can Kiss his mother on the way to savagely kill someone.Do not miss this movie, which is guaranteed to leave you being grateful about having such a simple life."
24846,False,"To me, this is the best film ever made. A bold statement you may think, but I the minute I saw Henry Hill utter the famous line of: ""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster"", followed by the kick of Tony Bennet's Rags to Riches, I knew I was in for something special.In the hands of any other director, this could have been a straightforward adaptation of Pileggi's ""Wise Guy"". Yet with Scorsese, the film is injected with an important dose of life - something I thought was slightly missing from The Godfather series. The relationships are so close and warm between these goodfellas, something that was absent from the cold relationships in Casino(1995).The actors react well to each other - the main actors being superb. Liotta has never been better as he was as Henry Hill, the man seduced by the mob life. Pesci never reached the great heights he did in this film, as the only 5ft5 man I know who can scare me. De Niro is doing what he does best, and that is playing the gangster, but in an understated fashion, never going into parody. Yet like most good films, it is the small things that make a difference - and there is no exception here. Even the minor roles are fully fleshed out, as if there is a life behind the story of Hnery Hill. Like Mickey Eyes...or Anthony...Jimmy Two Times (on the account that he says everything twice). The sheer density of the characters is to be commended.Scorsese has the knack of timing his music to the action that occurs on screen. But this isn't just a song played in its entirety (something Tarantino would do) - instead Scorsese chops and changes his songs, halfway through a scene. Take for example the ""1980's"" scenes, where Hill is in a fit of paranoia whilst delivering the guns to Jimmy and picking up drugs for himself. From the start of this powerful section of the film, we get Nilsson's ""jump into the fire"", followed by some Muddy Waters, mixed in with the Stones - to a dizzying effect, until we end this section with ""Jump into the fire"" again. Pure genius.This is also seen in the ""Layla"" montage - the piano exit of Eric Clapton's Layla introducing us to the fall of the gangsters who knew too much about the heist. From the pink cadilac, to the meat locker with Frankie Carbone in it - it is a beautiful scene, with so many great techniques on offer. I could go on forever with the amount of great scenes in this movie that work with the music (Billy Batts murder with Donovan's Atlantis...Tracking shot of Jimmy with Cream's Sunshine of my love...) - but that is for you to watch and experience.Goodfellas is a film lovers film. It has a great story (great narration too), superb acting from all, beautiful cinematography (Copacobana scene comes to mind, also with the visceral tracking shots) and the all seeing eye - Scorsese. Goodfellas is a film that is as violent as it is funny, a sense of humour in Scorsese's work also seen in King of Comedy and After Hours. This is Scorsese's (and in my humble opinion any director's) work. That is something considering how fantastic Raging Bull and Taxi Driver are.Visceral, violent and film lover's dream."
24847,False,"This is one of THE definitive ""mobster"" films of all time. It's one of Scorsese's best works, yet he ALWAYS ends up losing to someone less deserving I mean Dances with Wolves was OK, i'm not going to say it sucked at all, but come ON... I mean, ""Taxi Driver"" losing to ""Rocky"" is by FAR, one of the greatest upsets of all time I mean does the Academy have a grudge against Scorsese? They never give him a directing award or film...yet they'll give it to a movie about a boxer making his way to the top living out the old ""American dream"" fantasy tale instead of a dark look at the decay of human compassion, the deeper and darker films And telling him to come to the 2003 Oscars just to watch all of his 12 nominations win nothing, it's like an on going joke they are playing on Scorsese Will somebody give this man an Oscar!!!"
24848,False,"yes its true the godfather is #1, but I feel that goodfellas is completely over looked in this aspect. I mean if you actually sit down and watch this film; shot by shot, frame by frame, you can clearly see that goodfellas is the perfect rival for the #1 spot. From the beginning of the film you see henry hill trying to get in, and at the same time you as the viewer want in as well to this comfy, looked after environment, where you know you are loved and welcomed always. . . as long as you bust your butt. The film keeps you there for so long, until a certain point where you see the drugs and random hits take over the mafia world, bosses taking on bosses, wars. As the film comes to its close, like henry is trying to get out you want out of this world as well, because it is'nt what it once was. You see the godfather never made you feel like you wanted out, the family unit aspect was so tight, Mario puza could'nt have written that story any better, and coppola just knew what to do. The question is in goodfellas was the highest high worth the lowest low, and did it make you feel more comfortable than the family environment in the godfather, well thats up to you as the viewer to decide. I still think that goodfellas is the definitive rival for the #1 contenders spot."
24849,False,"""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a Gangster"". This classic line by Ray Liotta's character Henry Hill has been heard numerous times, and it starts of Martin Scorsese's unforgettable Gangster-movie ""GoodFellas""...This film portrays the life of the mob in a way that (at the time) had never been seen before. We follow Henry Hill who as a young kid watches the way the gangsters in his neighborhood takes over the whole city and rises to great power. He starts working for them, doing minor jobs. But later he would become one of the most important persons in the whole dynasty.What really has to be said about this film is that it's TOP entertainment. I've watched ""GoodFellas"" about 5-6 times since I bought it some years ago, and it's just as entertaining every time. The film is so masterful at every point, that it's just a joy to watch. But what's making Gangster-films like this so enjoying? If you think about it...everybody wants to be a gangster. We all want the money, the glamour and the power. Which guy wouldn't want to walk around, wearing those shiny suits, getting all those women and doing WHATEVER he wants? ***Spoiler Following*** But then again...many of the well-known Gangster-movies also shows the down-side of the gangster-life, and doesn't exactly have an happy ending. This film is one of them. ***End Of Spoiler***.When this film came, back in 1990, I'm sure it was breaking grounds. Being a gangster has never looked better. Unlike the ""dead-serious"" films people had seen earlier, this film had lots of charm and funny gangster-humor. That's why it makes the gangster-life look so lovely. Scorsese also shows us some of the coolest and most stylish gangster-characters ever seen on film. And these characters are being brought to us by actors like Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Paul Sorvino, who is all giving some terrific and unforgettable performances. Pesci who won the Oscar Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, steals the show in about every scene where his character Tommy DeVito is involved. A funny, short guy, with an even shorter temper, that you'll never forget. De Niro is just as good as we know he can be, in his role as the mob-veteran Jimmy Conway, and Paul Sorvino plays Paul Cicero, the boss of the dynasty, in an absolutely convincing way. The main-character Henry Hill is played by an impressive Ray Liotta, which I have never seen better.""GoodFellas"" is full of classic scenes and moments that you'll want to watch over and over again. ***Spoilers Following*** The restaurant-scene that introduces us to the grown-up Tommy for the first time...""How am I funny to you? Do I make you laugh, like a clown? Do I amuse you?"". Tommy's revenge when he gets embarrassed by Billy Batts, and the scenes where he's picking on Spider...""It was a good shot!"". ***End Of Spoilers*** These are only a few of them. If I'm going to complain about something in this film, then it's Lorraine Bracco in her role as Henry's wife Karen. Don't get me wrong, she's doing a good performance, but she doesn't convince me in EVERY scene she appears in. And when actors like Liotta, Pesci and De Niro gleams in their roles, she falls a little short in comparison.The directing is one of the best things in this film. Martin Scorsese is an artist behind the camera, and he directs this film in a perfect way. It's so exciting to watch this film, and I really like the scenes where the camera smoothly flies through the restaurants, bars and so on. And with Henry and Karen's voice-overs on top of it, it's all perfection. And I'm not going to forget to mention the soundtrack. Numerous great songs from the 60's and the 70's plays in the background during the major part of the movie, and gives us the right feeling for the setting of the film.I haven't seen ""Mean Streets"" (1973) yet, but if I'm going to pick out the best film by Martin Scorsese, then it would stand between this one and ""Taxi Driver"" (1976). It's hard to choose since it's two very different films. But both of them are classics, and films to be watched over and over again. ""GoodFellas"" is a masterpiece, and in the Gangster-genre it's only being topped by Italian director Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon A Time In America"" (1984), in my opinion. If you haven't seen it, then you sure is missing out one of the best Gangster-flicks that you'll ever see. And if you've already seen it, see it one more time and you'll probably consider it just as good and entertaining as the last time you saw it!10 out of 10"
24850,False,"I purchased what I consider to be my first choice as THE best film of all time on DVD recently and it got me thinking about a thought I had years ago. This is the most technically perfect film you will see.Okay, the editing has no consistency in parts,but that highlights the almost documentary feel to it. It is perfectly cast, brilliantly scripted, sublimly edited(by the genius Thelma Schoonmaker)and has a soundtrack most people can only dream of thinking of.I seriously think, and have done for years before seeing the extras on the new DVD, that if your a new filmmaker, or at least want to make a film, there is a blueprint here to follow.Close ups,freeze frame, LONG tracking shots,spitfire editing,all in all, complete. Hell Frank Darabont says he watched this film every Sunday he made ""The Shawshank Redemption"". And that's from the director of one of the most well thought of movies on this database.This one day will be recognised as THE definitive gangster movie,it is certainly the equal of The Godfather,perhaps not as sumptuos,but none the less it's equal and peer.It set a benchmark, but Marty improved it.Holy s*** did he.Be nice to yourself,perhaps one day you'll want to grow up to be a gangster.........."
24851,False,"There are so many things that I can write about that you haven't already heard. Such things like the best gangster film in the last decade or Scorcese does it again with true story status. So many things can be said about this film that if I said, the next guy adding a comment will only repeat what the others have said. But I will say one thing though, Scorcese has done it. He will keep on doing it. And nothing will stop him. Unless there's a ""Goodfellas 2"" which I doubt. Well hope not. And the one thing that I will always remember about Scorcese is the usage of his mom. Especially in the borrowing of the knife scene, which was great. Nice old lady, wonder what got her into the Mafia????---Cruizer07"
24852,False,"From the very first scene I was hooked. From start to finish this movie is a masterpiece.It is the quintessential ""modern"" gangster movie, but it's much more than a gangster movie and to call it such doesn't quite do it justice. It's a movie about friendship and loyalty and how outside elements and excess can ruin both. It also gives an insight on the life of and inner workings of the wiseguy network.Lorraine Bracco, Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, and Oscar winner Joe Pesci all turn in masterful performances and Martin Scorsese is at his best directing.There isn't a bad performance in the entire movie as a matter of fact. Each character is developed well and the dialogue is entertaining, yet authentic.In short this is a movie that lives up to the hype. It is essential for film buffs, pop culture gurus, and casual movie watchers.10/10"
24853,False,"GOODFELLAS (5 outta 5 stars)I remember thinking, when this movie came out ""Oh, here goes Scorsese again... another Italian gangster movie... ho hum... small role for DeNiro... big deal.""  Was I ever wrong!  My low expectations were completely turned upside down by this epic, sprawling masterpiece.  What it has taken ""The Sopranos"" 4 seasons and umpteen hours to portray... ""Goodfellas"" gets it all done in just over 2 and 1/2.  Ray Liotta portrays Henry Hill, a punk kid from a good family who gets in tight with the local mob, rising up in their ranks by robbing, killing and dealing drugs... until his inevitable fall.  Terrific cast of memorable characters (a lot of whom may not have been famous at the time but are certainly more well-known now)!  Rivetting storyline... practically every scene is a classic.  Very funny scenes interspersed with shockingly violent brutality.  Director Martin Scorsese was firing on all cylinders this time out... not a dull moment or a slack scene to be found.  Robert DeNiro has probably the least interesting character to play in this movie... and look what he does with it!  Amazing! Bonus points to Paul Sorvino who has his best screen role ever.  Don't miss this one!"
24854,False,"Every time I watch Goodfellas I have this undeniable urge to drink, smoke, and swear like a sailer on leave. Or in this case like the characters in Goodfellas. The movie tells the story of Henry Hill's rise through the organized crime racket through the 1950s-1980s. While it may be stylized and written for Hollywood the story it is based on is true. Any guy that has not yet seen this movie can not call himself a man. It is the quintessential guys movie, and Marty (as I like to call him) has done a wonderful and subtle job of directing the characters so they are outrageous without being over the top. This is a movie that has great character development and a fantastic cast as well as some of the best dialogue in film history."
24855,False,"I don't care what movie Ray Liotta ever acts in again. To me, he will ALWAYS be Henry Hill (or as the character Tommy DeVito says in the movie ""Hendry"").I can never get past his performance in this movie, his best in my opinion. I love his narration over much of the movie. The screenplay is amazing. Also enjoyed the wonderful acting by De Niro, who is amazing as Jimmy Conway (who ""roots for the bad guys in movies"") and Pesci, the loose cannon Tommy DeVito, among many others. The dialogue is awesome, with so many great lines that I know by heart, especially by the somewhat domesticated, somewhat wild Karen Hill, played by Lorraine Bracco (""You got some nerve standing me up. Who do you think you are, Frankie Valli or some kind of big shot?""). I loved her approach to convince her husband she needs more money to go shopping. Loved, loved, loved the soundtrack, too. You can feel the different decades covered in this movie, between the clothes, the music, the hair. Obviously wonderful direction under Scorsese, Goodfellas is one of the greatest movies ever made!"
24856,False,"Telling a great story means telling it vividly but without excess.  In a film this means the development of characters appropriate to importance, including the important details and not omitting the important details.  It means vibrant energy, without distraction caused by egotistical digression of writer, director or actor.Goodfellas doesn't tell a story of epic merit, but it does tell a damned good story - and it tells it so appropriately well, that the audience is absorbed into a world that is surreal but engrossing and credible.This film is a classic because it is doesn't fail any of the rules of fine movie construction - it exceeds them all.  The viewer is carried, even swept away with the poignant but tranquil first-person narration (similar to ""The Drug Store Cowboy"") in the sea of action, great moments, and big characters.Certainly this is a a must-see for serious film lovers."
24857,False,"Goodfellas is absolutely one of the best Gansgter movies ever! The original bad boys De niro and Pecci are now joined by Ray Liotta who transforms and already magnificent duo into a Tantalising Trio. The only thing missing in this film??? The one and only Al Pacino! If Al were to have starred in this movie it would still be the most popular movie ever. I only recently have witnessed the greatness of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro and wish that i had started witnessing (as it were) their great work a long time ago. Goodfellas is a great trial and error film, with plenty of risks and blood spillages (Joe Pecci getting shot in the head) (Joe Pecci shooting and stabbing a ""Made"" man in the back of his car) i would give this film ten out of ten, but.... i don't feel it deserves this rating. 8 out of 10 will do. This is a must have for any movie collection (even if you don't like it) Buy it now........A modern remake would also be great to see. As Joe and Robert are getting older we need new ""Orginial"" second hand bad boys. lets see...... Vanilla Ice??? No. I think not!"
24858,False,"One of my favorite movies, ever.  The plot is fascinating, each of the scenes is extremely powerful, Scorsese did a phemonenal job directing, and the acting is amazing.  Joe Pesci's character is one of the scariest characters I've ever seen on film or TV. Robert DeNiro is, as usual, terrific, and Ray Liotta plays his part perfectly.  The movie is over 2 hours long, but it goes by so quickly that you want to watch it all over again after it's over.The most chilling scene in the movie is the ""Layla"" scene...I've never felt that way about a scene in a movie before."
24859,False,"I had to see this movie ever since I first heard about it. I never used to watch gangster films but this one is certainly the greatest as far as i'm concerned along with Godfather I and II and Scarface following very closely behind. The performances, writing, directing are all outstnading. No actor is slightly better or worse and they are all matched by each other. Liotta, De Niro and Pesci are a fantastic team and they really do make you feel what its like in the world of the mafia. Nicholas Pileggi and Martin Scorese's script is outstanding is certainly Oscar worthy. But the acadamey disagreed. At least they didn't look down on Pesci's brilliant supporting performance. De Niro could also have won it and should have been nominated. But in my opinion Liotta desreved Best Actor. He is basically taking us on a guide of his 30 years of his life in the mafia and you just cannot take your eyes or ears for that matter of it for one second. The narration is done so brilliantly that you'd think Liotta was actually a member of the mafia! Anyway this a fantastic film about the ups and down these three guys (goodfellas) have throughout their time in the mafia and it has to be seen by everyone at some point in there life!A certain 10/10"
24860,False,"If you love gangster flick you will love this amazing film about a half Irish, half Italian mobster, and his life in the mafia. Scorsese's story telling is beautiful, and poetic, as towering performances from Robert Deniro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Loitta take center stage. Critics, and movie goers alike rave Goodfellas as one of the best ever made. Scorsese never lets you down, and every movie he makes will change your look on movies, and life. When Scorsese makes a new film, you tend to look forward to it, and Goodfellas is no exception. You will set down, and enjoy it's great acting, and juicy storyline to the very end. What an unforgettable work of art this is!"
24861,False,"As I sit and watch 'goodfellas' I realize that this film embodies the hopes and aspirations of a generation who had nowhere else to turn. As Henry describes his upbringing, you can't help but feel for the plight of his neighbourhood...(as he says he makes more than most of the adults as a teenager). This film doesn't glorify the mob, but it does identify the characters as human beings, especially Henry Hill. Plus it has the added benefits of many actors that have since made great cast members of sopranos Lorraine Bracco, Tony Sirico, Frank Vincent, but to name a few(another classic mob drama, roll on season 6!!) I'm not going to make a lengthy summary of this particular Scorsese classic,but I will say this, if ever there was a film to be seen based purely on recommendations, Goodfellas would be it. Plain and simple."
24862,False,"I just cant praise this movie enough! I love the Story, characters, acting, directing and editing from start to finish! I love the dialogue and almost documentary type of feeling you get from it. Who better than Marty tro direct the movie especially when based on a real story. This movie is much closer to the real story than Casion is(still a great Movie)Also the soundtrack is great! I would suggest to get look for the songs that do not appear on the soundtrack and also to read the book by Nicholas Pileggi. There are some interesting thing that did'nt make it into the movie! I'll rate this movie 10 out of 10!"
24863,False,"Brutal, bombastic, balletic, brilliant. Lots of things beginning with B. More fun than Raging Bull, funnier than Taxi Driver and more stylish than Mean Streets. Music, acting, cinematography, script - all present and top notch. Liotta is a revelation, Joe Pesci never better and De Niro is... well, he's De Niro. Scorsese's account of the life of mobster turned informant Henry Hill (Liotta) has class seeping from every frame. In a world populated by beautiful observed minor characters, with a pace that rarely slows and never stops and set piece after glorious set piece, not a moment of the camera's attention is wasted. Words cannot sum up it's greatness. Scorsese's legacy will be this film. Pure genius!"
24864,False,"I hate it when people ask me what my favorite movie of all time is.  That is like asking an art lover what their favorite painting is.  Break it down to favorite abstract painter, favorite contemporary artist, and you might get a more definitive answer.  So asking a movie buff what their favorite film is not entirely fair.  I have a favorite comedy, a favorite drama, horror, foreign film etc., but to pick one from the bunch is more question than I can handle.Given my above conundrum, if I was ever to amass a list of best-evers, 1990's Goodfellas would surely be near the top of the list.  Directed by Martin Scorsese and featuring an all-star cast including Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta, Goodfellas was nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture.  Although at the end of the March ceremony, only one award was engraved with a participant's name - Pesci for Supporting Actor - Goodfellas remains as maybe the best film of the 1990's.
Based on the novel 'Wiseguy', by Nicholas Pileggi, the movie follows the true story of Henry Hill (Liotta), as he rises through the ranks of the mob. From child to young adult, we watch Henry as he gains acceptance, gets married, and goes to jail, starts dealing drugs, all leading to his capture by authorities.Along for the wild ride of mob hits, heists and murders are Jimmy and Tommy (DeNiro and Pesci, respectively), two lifetime mobsters that take Henry under their wings and teach him the ropes.  Jimmy is the elder statesman who handles things professionally and is respected for his calm demeanor. Tommy is the hot-head stereotype who resorts to violence whenever threatened. Together, they provide the perfect balance for Henry as he tries to cope with life in the underworld while maintaining a normal life presence.Goodfellas is a near perfect film.  Scorsese has cast each part with actors born to play their role.  From Paul Sorvino as the mob figurehead to Lorraine Bracco in a breakthrough performance as Henry's love interest, the cast fits together like a leather glove.  And they each have cool names to boot.  There is Spider, Fat Andy, Pete the Killer and Jimmy Two Times just to ramble off a few.  Whether you were a bit player or someone with a bigger trailer, Scorsese handles everyone with crafted dialogue and incredible attention to authenticity.What also makes Goodfellas so good, are the costumes and set design that bring us right back to the 70's and 80's tacky kitchens and pastel living room furniture.  Scorsese does well in bringing us through multiple decades and showing the natural progression of the actors and their belongings as time marches forward.Even the voice over works.  Not a fan of this cheap tactic to move a story forward, Henry Hill bursts narration throughout the film with quotes like, `Jimmy was the kinda guy that rooted for bad guys in the movies' and `Whenever we needed money, we'd rob the airport. To us, it was better than Citibank.'  Each narration brings either humor or does well in helping us grow with the characters and eventually cheering for violence bearing mafia.But if I could pick one thing to give the director his chops, it would have to be in his depiction of Henry Hill.  By taking his time with the story (the movie does run 145 minutes), we can follow Henry through the many stages of his involvement.  When Henry is involved with his first encounter with violence, it is a believable occurrence based on the progression. And when Henry begins selling drugs, we may not agree, but we can definitely understand what brought him and his family to that stage of their lives.The DVD comes without many special features, and that is too bad.  It would be interesting to hear Scorsese talk about how some cast members (Michael Imperioli and Tony Sirico) went on to become famous with the Soprano's, or how he was able to nab Samuel L. Jackson and Vincent Gallo for parts all but forgotten by the audience before the end credits.Five stars are not to be taken or given lightly.  Goodfellas deserves every one of them."
24865,False,"If there's one thing Goodfellas it criticsed for, its the lack of definite storyline, since it follows more of a documentary style of gangster life than it does a plot. Yet each scene is so engaging, so beautifully acted and includes such top-knotch script writing that you will forget that aspect and become drawn into individually sections. Because, after all, this film aimed to depict the mafia lifestyle, it was never an action or thriller-based story. The random violence that occurs and brilliant narration throughout only serve to further enhance the entire image the film gets across. The character relationships are also cleverly forged together, and the unpredictable nature of the film allows you to hinge nicely throughout and keeps you in suspense. Perhaps this film is not for everyone, if you like a proper storyline you may be disappointed, but this film is pure genius since it followed- and achieved what it set out to do- shock and exploit the very innards of gangster life. Now become the don and watch it :D"
24866,False,"I first watched this movie a few years ago and it blew me away. The way the characters change and develop over the years and eventually turn on each other is a wonderful piece of storytelling. Made so much better because it's based on a true story. It captures the atmosphere, fashions and music of the era perfectly. It could be accused of glamourising organized crime, but the brutal killings put an end to this. If you have not seen this movie, I strongly recomend it! 10/10"
24867,False,"GoodFellas is the best movie of the nineties, the best gangster movie off all time, and my favorite move.  All the actors are so great like Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci.  It's full of great scenes and is so entertaining.  I can watch it over and over again.  It's definitely Scorsese's best, with Taxi Driver and Raging Bull really close behind."
24868,False,"Nothing compares to the perplexing feelings you get as you find yourself feeling ""good"" as this group of narcissistic scummy psychotic social deviates rampage across the screen committing every vile act imaginable.But still, it's a good feeling, good flowing, goodfella movie!I watch this frequently because I never tire of the phenomenal acting, the wonderful narration, and the fantastic music!"
24869,False,"I absolutely can't remember how many times I have seen this movie but every time I discover new things I saw not before and I am sure it's one of those rare movies that are made to watch over and over just because it might perhaps be the best movie ever made, and if not it certainly is in the Top 10 of it somewhere. There are so many stars in here... Martin Scorsese who just is the ideal proof that a director can be a personality himself, someone who you can recognize from style (I am sure that you only will can come up with 20 directors of so whose style can be recognized), Robert De Niro who is just the best actor of all time, full stop, Ray Liotta who perhaps could have join De Niro if only he had some better roles to play as in here he is superb, Joe Pesci who plays the ideal gangster who is nuts, Lorraine Bracco who plays the perfect role of the woman that will always stay loyal to her gangsterhusband, the soundtrack (just remember how Sid Vicious' ""My way"" or Derek and The Dominos' ""Layla"" has been used). I am sure I will rewatch this movie soon, for the 20th or 30th time perhaps...and indeed better than all gangstermovies ever made."
24870,False,"This movie is truly class.Right from the start you are introduced to the violence of the film, and like all good gangster movies, the violence continues right the way through.The 3 main characters play excellent roles, Pesci being a particularly vicious one. Some of his actions are downright scary, from winding Ray Liotta up early on in the film, to some of his actions later on. He really is disturbed.The plot takes us through the life of Henry Hill (Liotta) from how he got involved as a youngster, to how he ends up later on in life.Some of the dialog is fantastic, Pesci joking with Liotta in the restaurant is memorable, and I find myself using lines from the film in daily life. Picture the scene in a pub, someone bumps my friends drink over and nothing is said... Until I ask him ""Are you gonna let him away with that...?""I love true stories and violent gangster movies and this film has it all. Easily my favourite film, I have watched it over and over several times, and its still brilliant.10 out of 10"
24871,False,"For some The Godfather was the greatest gangster movie ever made. For me it is hands down, Goodfellows. Why? Because not only do we see what the world of a made man is really like, we get to experience it too. Simply brillant."
24872,False,"Goodfellas blows The Godfather away. You read that right. The Godfather is a bloated, wheezing blob compared to this tight masterpiece. The real jewel of this film is the incredible cast, everyone turning in Oscar caliber performances. Goodfellas is one of those movies that you can watch hundreds of times and never get sick of it. Ray Liotta's narration gives you the lay of the land on the story and never grates on your nerves. Martin Scorcese's direction is a thing of beauty and Joe Pesci's performance is the best of his career, even considering he played basically the same character in Casino. A great soundtrack and dazzling cinematography make this film a national treasure. Bottom Line: The power of this film cannot be underestimated and I wouldn't be out of line by saying this is Scorcese's best film. Truly a masterpiece."
24873,False,"Brilliant gangster movie that shows the rise (and subsequent fall)of young lads (Liotta, DeNiro and Pesci)up the crime ladder. The scenes with Liotta are particularly effective as is the general narrative. I liked the portrayal of Liotta's move into drug dealing and his and his wife's later descent into cocaine addiction. The frenzied moments when the police helicopter is tailing Liotta accompanied by the background playing of Harry Nilsson's ""Into The Fire"" captures the scene perfectly. An excellent gangster movie that has it all - on a par with the Godfather."
24874,False,"Goodfellas is a masterpiece of the life of a gangster. Through 4o years, Henry Hill develops as a gangster and as does Ray Liotta's character. The credulous plot and acting given by Robert De Niro and Joe Pasci, who won an Oscar for his part in the film, makes this film a must see for any gangster flick loving person. If you liked this movie, you should check out King of New York, The Godfather, Once Upon a Time in America, and Empire."
24875,False,"I don't know where the f*ck have i been all my life??? I saw the film 13 years after it came out....but still i LOVED it, especially the cast. I was sure, even before i saw the movie, that DeNiro is going to be great (he always is), and i'm a big fan of Liotta too. Who struck me the most was Pesci. He played out his role f*cking perfectly...by far his best work. And also Bracco - just SUPER!!!so anyone who has not seen it yet......u don't know what you're missing"
24876,False,"Martin Scorsese is America's greatest director and this is his greatest movie. It's detractors claim that it glamourises violence, it's cold hearted, and that it's cartoonish, all of which are baseless. The ending is far from a glamorous outcome for Ray Liotta's Henry Hill, while there is real warmth in many scenes, particularly the one in which Joe Pesci visits his mother (played by Catherine Scorsese, Marty's mother). And if it is cartoonish, at least it's more enjoyable than the comparitively sombre Casino. Liotta is the centre of this movie and his performance is justly towering. Joe Pesci is also memorable as Tommy, the most psychotic gangster ever. De Niro isn't as good here as in his other Scorsese collaborations but he's still silently menacing. Technically, tracking shots, cutting, freeze frames and a rock/pop score are brilliantly used to create a vibrant depiction of the gangster lifestyle. Goodfellas never looses it's grip, not even on repeat viewings. Deserves to be made compulsory viewing."
24877,False,"This movie is based on the book Wiseguy. The book was based on a true story, so ofcourse the movie is too. The film is about three friends who become criminals. Robert DeNiro is one hell of an actor. He plays the friendly, but tough criminal: Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway. This role was probably pretty damn tough. Then there's Ray Liotta who plays Henry Hill. Henry Hill is a cocaine sniffing young criminal. Joe Pesci is funny (as he showed in My Cousin Vinny). He still has a little bit of comedy in this movie. He plays the maniac, Tommy DeVito. That role earned him an Academy Award. Lorraine Bracco plays Karen Hill (Henry's wife). Bracco has a tough role playing Hill's wife. Then last, but not least. There's Paul Sorvino. He plays the mob boss: Paul Cicero. Or in the movie: Paulie. All these great actors, but what about the director? Well the director is Martin Soresce. We know Soresce directing films like: Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Gangs of New York. Overall, this movie is absolutley brilliant! Watch it people! A 10 out of 10!"
24878,False,"""As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster.""I remember reading Roger Ebert's review of ""Gangs of New York"" and though his review of the film was biased, he mentions how GoodFellas was a classic in point of direction and of characters. As I recall, people have mention that ""The Godfather"" is the best crime film ever made, but I disagree; ""The Godfather"" was a film that showed the consequences of people in organize crime or in a organization, but not GoodFellas. GoodFellas shows the exciting sides of people in the mafia, where they would go to bars, dinners, and laugh at America and those who were inferior to them.GoodFellas is a story about a young Irishman name Henry Hill (played by Ray Liotta as the older version) who every night sees the mobsters hanging on the other side of the street where he sees them park their cars in the middle of the streets, play cards and play their music all night without anybody complaining. The leader of the mafia is Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino) who is reclusive towards the neighborhood, sure people have heard of him, but he doesn't like people watching him and yet Henry himself lies to his parents when he decides to work for Paul and his mafia and is finally notice in the neighborhood, though his father doesn't approve, his dad beats Henry a couple of times. But does that stop him? No.Years later, Henry grows up (Ray Liotta now) and is enjoying what he is actually doing. He steals and kills like the rest of the gangsters in order to make ends meat instead of working nine-to-five jobs for stupid paychecks.During the film we encounter a group of characters in the film that not only work for Henry, but also change the face in cinema history. Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway (Robert De Niro) is the rebel that cheers for the bad guys in the movie and has been in jail when he was twelve for stealing. In the film, Henry narrates that Jimmy ""enjoys"" stealing and throughout the film, De Niro does make his presence where if you see his face, show him some respect. Another character in the film is Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) whose reputation is more than being in the mafia, but actually has a wild temper when somebody makes him mad. In one scene at a party, Tommy is embarrassed by the fact that the owner of the restaurant wants him to pay the tab of $7,000, and yet beats the hell out of the waiter proving that you can't mess with a crew of the mafia, no matter what the rank is.There's another character in the story that is also a narrator, and the character is Karen (Lorraine Bracco), who was pressure to go out with Henry on a double date so that way Tommy can bang the girl of his dreams. In one scene she is stood up by Henry and tells Tommy to go after her and after embarrassing Henry in front of the mafia on the streets, Karen goes out with Henry on a single date where she doesn't what he does. Later during the film, she finds out that he's in the mob and fears that she will lose him.A lot of things happen during the film; a made man is killed, Henry cheats on his wife and goes to jail, a money heist takes place, half of Jimmy's mafia gets whacked and a supporting character gets killed.With a great soundtrack and a great storyline, GoodFellas proves that cheering for the bad guys is a good thing after all."
24879,False,"This is truly on of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  It shows in beautiful detail how the criminal underground works.  The story being true only helped its accuracy.  The lead performances where perfect, especially Liota's, he really made the movie what it is.  The transformation he goes through is really amazing.The perfect balance of violence, crime, and comedy make this movie what it is.  There are enough jokes to balance off the dead bodies and the drug content.  And the cinematography is mind boggling.  The story is flawless and the ending made the whole thing worth it.  It scary to think Conway will be out of prison next year (2004)... I wonder if there will be a sequel in like 50 years about what Conway did after he got out.All and all a brilliant movie that comes so close to perfection it's scary. It's a shame it didn't win best movie, it really was worthy in ever light.9/10, easily."
24880,False,"There is no doubt that Goodfellas is a true gangster classic which represents high points in the careers of those involved in it. Scorsese tells the true story of Henry Hill and his cohorts superbly, starting as he means to go on - with a violent, profanity ladened fast paced tale of Hill's rise to prominence in New York's organised crime underworld during the sixties and seventies and his subsequent rapid demise as he goes from airport heists to drug dealing and finally ends up in the witness protection scheme where he remains to this day.As Scorsese takes us on this twenty five year journey we are introduced to and get to know the various wiseguys that Hill associates with, from those at the very top like Paulie Cicero to people like Morrie (Chuck Low) and brief introductions to Jimmy ""Two Times"" and Fat Andy etc. And then there is Tommy De Vito. Let's make no mistake about it, this is Pesci's finest performance which rightly won him the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Unlike Casino in which he basically plays the same character but with a different name, in Goodfellas Pesci is far more believable as a guy who will kill people without thinking twice but despite this, he doesn't make the audience dislike him, he is a far more rounded character and despite all his violence, and after all the fast talking and wisecracks you can't help but like him and find him amusing.Pesci is the one with most of the best lines in the film, the most famous of which is the Funny How? scene which legend has it was written and directed by Pesci at the request of Scorsese. It is a scene that demonstrates both sides of Tommy's character perfectly and which couldn't have been bettered in any way. It's definitely one of my favourite movie moments.Pesci's undoubtably steals the show in Goodfellas but every single character in the film is played to perfection. Liotta, despite not going on to bigger and better things after Goodfellas, is convincing as Henry and De Niro despite not having as much screen time as one might expect in such a film plays the charismatic but also ""violent when necessary"" Jimmy Conway, who holds a lot of sway within the organisation and is the orchestrator of most of the heists. Others of note include : Lorraine Bracco, Frank Vincent, Paul Sorvino and Catherine Scorsese who plays Tommy's mother, all of whom fit their respective roles in the film perfectly.**** out of 4"
24881,False,"Martin Scorsese is the greatest living American director, and Goodfellas is clearly his masterpiece.  The reason why is because it is essentially a culmination of all the themes and filmic styles he was working with prior to Goodfellas.  What makes Goodfellas stands out is the passion which Scorsese displays in every scene.  Unlike Casino and Gangs of New York, which were also great movies, Goodfellas has a sense of enjoyment and liveliness amidst all the carnage.After Goodfellas, Scorsese made plenty of great movies, but nothing he has done since, and prior to Goodfellas, reaches the pinnacle of this miraculous piece of filmmaking.Long live Scorsese!"
24882,False,"Without a doubt, Goodfellas is Martin Scorsese's chef d'oeuvre.  This adaptation of Pileggi's book is a masterpiece of cinematography.  Rather than have you read through a superlative-packed review, I urge you to just watch it if you haven't already. And look out for the special edition DVD that I hope Warner will release promptly. 10/10"
24883,False,this is my 3rd favorite film of all time is is brilliant and well actored joe pesci is great well deserved his oscar this should have also got the best film oscar in 1990 it was better then dances with wolves but i still like dances with wolves 10/10
24884,False,"I'm not a big fan of picking out ""best"" films, but I've got to say that this is possibly my best film of all time.There are superb performances from Pesci, De Niro, and Liotta, and it's one of the few films I can watch again and again, as there's always something new.I strongly recommend watching this."
24885,False,"How this movie lost the 1990 Best Picture Award to ""Dances with Wolves"" is one of Hollywood's great injustices. To put it another way, if you had three hours to burn right now and had to pick between ""Goodfellas"" and ""DWW"", which movie would you rather watch?The story is awesome, the acting superb, the laughs and shocks come at you throughout, the body count is high, and the it never drags once in the almost 2 and 1/2 hour running time. Look for at least five future Sopranos stars (you know the actors'names, so I'll give you their HBO alter egos---Dr. Melfi, Christopher, Big Pussy, Paulie Walnuts, & Phil Leotardo) It's an all time TOP 10 treat."
24886,False,"Goodfellas is a must see for any gangster movie lover.  It is an excellent movie, well done in every aspect.  Martin Scorsese does a great job in directing this movie.  Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta deliver grade A performances in this masterpiece of a film."
24887,False,"Goodfellas shows that you can put great actors and a great director together and make it work,even more so:Make a Masterpiece!My favorite director Martin Scorsese is teamed up with two of my favorite actors:Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. Add to that a great script,great dialogues and beautiful music and you get an all-time classic.The first scene of the movie shows that it won't be always easy to watch,but the violence is never over the top in this movie,although it is often gruesome.But then,Goodfellas isn't a movie about a tea party! The way that Scorsese mixes the scenes with period music is absolutely brilliant.He did it in Mean Streets and would do it again in his other Gangster Classic:Casino. Just look and listen when the scene comes up in which De Niro and Pesci brutally kick and punch a Maffia hood almost to his death.The song Atlantis by Donovan makes the scene even better and gives it an extra dimension.The story is well-known so I won't tell that,although it is very well put together and has no loose ends. Joe Pesci plays like never before,he only reached this same divine level in Casino and De Niro is brilliant as always.Ray Liotta is also very good here and it is a shame that he never surpassed or even reached the same level ever again.Although I think that the follow up,Casino,is an even better picture Goodfellas remains an all-time classic and it is a shame that it never won the Oscar(Best Picture or Best Director!!). But then,most classics don't! 10/10"
24888,False,"Undoubtedly, Goodfella's is an exceptional film that portrays life in a notorious gang, with no holds barred.  The cast is simply electric, as Ray Liotta delivers a wonderfully colourful and emotional performance as the boy striving to be a someone in a land of 'losers'.  The film focuses on Liotta's ambition to be part of something extraordinary, something that will give him an identity above anyone else.  Robert de Niro eventually becomes an overseer of Liotta's and together with Joe Pesci, who's depiction of Tommy Devito - a brutal gang member who always acts before he thinks - become embroiled in heists of an undercover nature.  The pace of the movie is exquisite, as issues of ambition and loyalty ensure Liotta's (Henry Hill) excitement of the way the other half live is kept to optimum.  Love is also on the horizon, but a Mobsters world is never a straight die as drugs cloud judgement and errors test friendships.  Simply fantastic."
24889,False,"goodfellas, classic. one word genius. I first got the privalage of seeing this film a couple of years ago, i was absolutely gobsmaecked to say the very least. Ok, martin is a  great director, hes had  some poor films , like any before him , but you just forget those specific faliures when u witness this film and a couple similiar films by martin such has casino, taxi driver and most recently the gangs of new york. Ray liotta is a great actor and he deserves a  notice for this one. his ability to play himself occasional may shadow out,but who else could have pulled this role off , very few , maybe de niro but then who whould have played de niro????? Watch this one , even if to prove people and 80% of actors , audiences and the entity of the world, that this isnt a  good movie ,."
24890,False,"after only being made in 1990, it's amazing how much of a 'classic' it is known as already. But it deserves every bit of applause that it gets, as it truly is a legendary film. Right from the start, you are pulled head first into this world of petty crooks, and murderous gangsters, and the pace just never slows down. You have pesci, and liotta all putting in their best work. De niro is great but not new. And with scorsese behind the camera, the audience are treated to some brilliantly executed scenes. Be it the 'classic' ""you think i'm funny?"" scene, or the handgun to the nose beating scene, which is done so realistically, you can feel the cracks as his nose spurts blood. And the use of music in the film fits like a glove, really setting a tone, and enhancing the mood. I don't think it could have been put together more perfectly. It's a long film, but it's one you never actually want to end."
24891,False,"Goodfellas was a fast moving, good mobster movie. Scorsese's best movie, it shows behind the lives of mobsters. Joe Pesci had some good lines. Probably his best movie. I think this was by far Ray Liotta's best movie. Robert De Niro did a great job, but I don't think it was his best. The movie was graphic at times. This movie is excellent. **** out of **** stars."
24892,False,"Goodfellas is without a doubt one of the best movies of the 90s. In fact, I rank it up with the Godfather. It is one of the best crime movies ever. Martin Scorcese has shown some excellent direction in this movie.Ray Liotta was excellent, Robert DeNiro was excellent, Joe Pesci was excellent. This movie has some of the best casting I've ever seen.The story was great, and the execution of the story added to it. Goodfellas is a great movie. IMDb thinks so, AFI thinks so, I think so too. 10/10."
24893,False,"What can i say? The best movie that I have ever seen. I have seen this movie dozens of time and it gets better all the time. Great, great movie, with great, great cast. Come on, what would u expect? Scorsese, De Niro, liotta etc... It's hard to comment why this movie is so great... Please if you haven't seen this movie, go check it out, then you know!"
24894,False,"Without going into too much detail here, I'd just like to say that this movie is as much about the life in the mafia as our own lives.  This movie goes into great detail to exemplify just how little and irrelevant most of us are in this corrupt world.Overall a great movie that goes through a lot of stages, packed with action, suspense, emotions as well as some good old laughs.  Lots of very solid characters in there, all of them played very well, by the very best and directed by the best, could you ask for anything more?This movie is so good, it demands the viewer to watch it in a suit. Highly recommended, 10 out of 10 ."
24895,False,"I overreacted in saying that Casino was better than Goodfellas, that is not true. I just said that cause I heard people writing bad stuff about Casino and I didnt like that. They are both equally excellent. now I know why people say they are similar because they are both adapted screenplays from books with the same author. But it is two completely different places that they take place in.Goodfellas has a bunch of excellent performances. Joe Pesci is fantastic as a bad ass. Robert De Niro was also great, Liotta wasnt bad but he was overshadowed by the other two. Lorraine Braccos performance I think is overrated. This movie has a very well written script and deserved to win. Scorseses Direction is very well down in this movie.Now I think Scorsese should have won Best Director for this but the academy thought different. Now hes gonna win for Gangs of New York which is crap compared to Goodfellas. He will win for GONY cause they passed up the oppurtunity on Goodfellas and Raging Bull. Scorsese should have also at least be nominated for Best Director for Casino. Now he will win for a movie that doesnt deserve it."
24896,False,"This film blows The Godfather saga out of the water! This is an excellent film! The characters are way more interesting than The Godfather, in my opinion. The story is about a young unmade associate to the New York Italian Mafia, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) who tells his story from when he was twelve to when he was about thirty something. His friends, and buddies are a much older man Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) and a about-the-same-age violent mental midget Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). He tells the story about the big boss Paulie (Paul Sorvino) and his goomars and his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco - The Sopranos). The film is the second best Scorcese movie ever made. The reason I loved it so much is it has great writing, directing and acting. Other big stars are in it such as Sopranos stars Michael Imperioli, Tony Sirico, Vincent Pastore, Tony Darrow and Pulp Fiction star Samuel L. Jackson has a little but memorable part. Rent this movie, today! Grade: A"
24897,False,"This movie is the kind you can watch again and again.  The true story of Henry Hill Italian/Irish gangster.  This movie shows the rise of Henry Hill in the mob.  From young errand boy to an associate.  The acting is superb, with the likes of Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci playing the main three characters.  This movie had a lot of promise and lives up to the hype. From the very first live in the movie to the last.  This story grabs you and doesn't let go. This movie has it all from comedy, Joe Pesci's ""whadda ya mean I'm funny"" is classic, to drama.  Watch this movie and there is no reason it won't be in your top 10."
24898,False,"Easily one of the best mafia movies ever!!! Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci STILL rule and are STILL some of the best actors out there. I also highly recommend Casino if you like this film. Why can't they make another movie like this?!?!?!?
PS Did I mention I love this movie?"
24899,False,"Goodfellas was really good film, with excellent acting by Ray Loita and Joe pesci.  With DeNiro pitching around the corners.  Joe pesci was espically cool with his ""anger problems"" and mentally disturbed state of mind.  The movie has some dark comical moments, very funny. A must see.."
24900,False,"Even though I've seen it a couple dozen times, I always get depressed when it's over because I wish we could spend a few more hours w/these amazing characters. As awesome a job as Costner did w/""Dance With Wolves,"" it's too bad Scorcese got no Oscars for this fine piece of work.No mob movie (or any movie) comes close to matching this masterpiece - not even ""The Godfather."" It's an absolute joke that Ray Liotta didn't get a nomination for this. The then little-known actor commands your attention for 2 1/2 hours, even opposite legendary film heavyweights like De Niro and Pesci.In a word - CLASSIC."
24901,False,"I was extrememly satisfied with this movie. I liked the whole feel of the movie and the way Ray Liotta told the story, it made me really see the world of gangsters. The little clever things that he would do throughout the movie was really appealing, but then slowly everything begins to deteroirate towards the end. De Niro and Pesci both give good performances too. I liked the part when Joe Pesci was messing with Ray Liotta about when he said he was a funny guy, me and my friends act out that part occasionally, its a bit silly. This is one of those movies that you enjoy watching, and it takes a while to get tired of watching it."
24902,False,"Personally, my favorite gangster movie of all time.  Bobby D (Robert DeNiro) is amazing.  The movie is about wise guys from the early 50's up until the late 70's.  A must have, collection wise, for the mob-scene lovers!"
24903,False,"The life story of gangster from childhood to present day.The reason classic movies are so few and far between is that there is too much to go wrong. It is, after all, the most combined of the arts. But boy when the script, acting, music and direction come right you have the greatest art form in the world. I have sat and thought how I cannot give this movie 10 out of 10 - but I cannot find one, so 10 it is.(I had to break a my vow never to give a 10 to do this. After all how many things are perfect?  But it is a step better than my 9 movies, so what can I do?)It is ironic that Liotta - the central figure (Henry Hill) - in this drama is the least impressive and a class below both Pesci (he will never get a role as good as this) and De Niro (under acting here for once). Whether this is deliberate (so as to make it look less sexy?) I don't know. The Liotta movies that have followed have done nothing to to change my mind - although the role suits him right down to the ground so he is not doing any damage.(Can the guy play people of authority? Teachers, lawyers, government officials? In other words, people WITHOUT a screw loose?)De Niro doesn't have to do much in gangster roles. He is introduced - in voice over - as 28 and despite the fact that he is clearly in his 40's we don't care. His Jimmy ""the Gent"" Conway is a slimeball crime figure, not that bright, but brighter than those around. What do they say: In the world of the blind the one-eyed man is king?Conway has worked out that it is easier to kill people than pay them the money he owes. He cannot knock the writer (Nicholas Pileggi) for this because it happens to be true. I could live without this fact being set to pop music though.Pesci won an Oscar for his Tommy Devito. This is the most amazing performance in the history of cinema: Deadly and funny at the same time. A complete acting master class and we are going to be seeing versions of this in movies forever. This role is to him what  the Zorba The Greek was to Anthony Quinn: To good to be played only once!The hyprocracy, stupidity, the viciousness, the black humour are all well done. Who else but director Scorsese would dare start with a scene that involves such callous violence? People that don't like this scene should stick to Disney movies, this is violence that is real and is based on a real incident. If some viewers prefer plastic violence, so what?
This might be the best piece of work that Martin Scorsese ever brings to the screen. Some comedians call it ""Martin Scorsese's Greatest Hits"". I call it Martin Scorsese's most perfectly realised picture.Oh there is one thing I don't like about it - the trailer is terrible and sells the picture as being pro violence."
24904,False,"I have one annual event each year to pass the date of my birth.  That is to wake up and watch GOODFELLAS!  I am here to tell you that for the past 10 years, there is no better way to start off my birthday morning.  DeNiro's character Jimmy Conway is my favorite without a doubt, especially when he starts offing his own crew.  The soundtrack works so well with the action on screen, and really helps the mood sway.  A masterpiece!"
24905,False,Mafia Movies are my thing so I know and seen them all. I have to say that Goodfellas was great! Beautifully written. It gave a great detail on the famous turncoat( Doublecrosser) Henry Hill. Joe Pesci was GREAT! Robert DeNiro was also great and so was Ray! I give this movie a 10! I love it! Def one of my favorites!
24906,False,"Liotta rules this movie. Big acts by Deniro, Pesci, Bracco... but Ray Liotta it's the essence of this movie. I just can't understand how can people say this is a great movie, and, at the same time, saying that Liotta is lousy, must see this movie sober (or drunk!).One of the movies of my life!"
24907,False,"I think this is a great movie.  Based on a true story, it shows how friends go from pulling petty crimes to committing bloody murders.  Rat Liotta is wonderful as Henry Hill, the small time gangster who eventually gets caught up in the serious and deadly mob life.  Robert De Niro is brilliant, as always, as Jimmy Conway.  And Joe Pesci is great (even if he's a little vulgar) as Tommy De Vito, his Oscar winning role.  The saddest part is when Tommy is really excited about getting in to the exclusive, 100% Italian mafia, and then ends up getting killed.  I really feel Jimmy's pain when he mourns the loss of his friend.  Even though they're really bad people, they still have feelings for their friends. Martin Scorsese does a great job directing this mafia masterpiece.  I definitely think that ""GoodFellas"" is a movie that everyone should see, because in the end, Henry does what's right.  So I give ""GoodFellas"" a 9 out of 10!"
24908,False,"My Age: 13Based on the book by Nicholas Pileggi (Wiseguy), GoodFellas follows Henry Hills' life in the Mafia throughout three decades.  It begins when he is just a kid associating with mobsters.  He meets James Conway, played by Robert de Niro, and Tommy de Vito, played by Joe Pesci.  When he is older, Henry, played by Ray Liotta, gets a wife, Karen, played by Lorraine Bracco. His new life involves various crimes including killing other gangsters and beating up people for money.GoodFellas, directed by Martin Scorsese, is a very interesting and intelligent look at life within the Mafia.  It has a few camera shots that last a few minutes without cutting, which are very good to look at.  I would warn the faint-hearted to avoid this, because there is a fair amount of violence and gore.  The story of Henry Hill's life is told very well, and the character is portrayed well by Ray Liotta.  Robert de Niro, Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco are also very good in their roles.  In the end, GoodFellas is a very good film, one that I would recommend.Australian Classification: R 18+: Occasional Graphic Violence and Very Frequent Coarse LanguageRating: 82 out of 100"
24909,False,"I loved this movie! It was a so real depiction of mob life on the small time going up to the big time. Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino were great. Joe Pesci did a great job too but I'll admit that before the movie was over I wanted to ""whack"" his character because he grated on my nerves so much, Pesci pulled it off completely. The is a well scripted, superbly executed movie. Liotta was devine. Lorraine Bracco makes you realize how a woman can fall in love with a mobster. This is a rare must see movie. Ray Liotta's best. The dialouge was quick and memorable. Everything was memorable. One caution- the F word gets big time play so if it affends you be warned."
24910,False,"...you should be shot!  This is the ultimate mob movie, and it really lives up to its tagline of ""three decades of life in the Mafia"".  Instead of being a standard, point-A to point-B kinda movie, Goodfellas really gives you the sense that you're watching someone's life unfold.  Just like in real life, characters move in and out of Henry's life, appearing and disappearing from view at random points in time.  We are treated to some ""precious moments"" that might not help advance the very loose plot, but give us glimpses in Henry's life.  For example, the long steadicam shot as Henry walks his future wife Karen into the Copacabana, the famous ""funny"" sequence, and the scene where Tommy's mother cooks the guy's dinner while they have a body in the trunk really give you a sense that these are REAL people, not the stereotypes in fedoras and slick suits that you often see in gangster pictures.  I could write for hours about this film, but I don't know if you'd want to read all that."
24911,False,"Tough and uncompromising with its rather hilarious moments, ""Goodfellas"" is one of the best Mafia movies ever.  It's the story of Henry Hill, from the day he decided he wanted to be a gangster until the day he joined the Witness Protection Program.   All along the movie, he sticks with crazy Tommy De Vito (Pesci) and living-mob-legend, Jimmy Conway (De Niro) as they work for Paulie (Paul Sorvino).  All goes well for Henry until he starts cheating on his wife and then gets sent to jail.  The scenes in the jail where you see where wiseguys live apart from the rest of the prisoners are excellent (especially when Henry describes diner in jail).  As good as Liotta, Bracco , De Niro, and Sorvino are though, it's Joe Pesci who rules this movie.  His incarnation of the crazy, cowboy-like, short-tempered Tommy De Vito, he is excellent and it's understandable that he won the Oscar for best supporting-actor (he also supplies a lot of the laughs).  Don't miss this one.  It's definitely one of Scorsese's best."
24912,False,"This is possibly the best Mafia movie you could ever see. Ray Liotta, in one of his best roles, narrates throughout the movie, and it works wonderfully. This movie tries to show the true feeling of being a gangster; you never know who your friends are, and never trust anyone. De Niro is good, Pesci is good, and the direction by Scorcese is good. This movie is hard, cold and cruel. It's highly recommended."
24913,False,"I recommend everybody seeing this outstanding movie.You will find the scope to grasp such  powerful actors Robert De Niro  and Joe Pesci are.Especially Pesci's performance is worth seeing.I can say that everything is perfect in the movie except Ray Liotta.He is virtually lost besides other big players. I couldn't find the opportunity to see ""Goodfellas"" in 1990 but I added it to my top ten last night."
24914,False,"Scorcese presents his talent again with Robert De Niro in this gangster masterpiece.  Watching this movie puts all other true gangster movies to shame.  Even a contest for the Godfather series, Goodfellas is truly great."
24915,False,"It happened again.  Just as America's greatest living (greatest ever?) director created the best film of the decade in 1980 -- ""Raging Bull"" -- and lost the Oscar to Robert Redford's ""Ordinary People"" (an outrage by all accounts), yet another thespian's pretentious film -- Kevin Costner's ""Dances With Wolves"" -- beats out one of the best acted, best directed, most kinetically charged and most entertaining/horrifying films ever created... ""GoodFellas""This is one hell of a ride.  Everything in the film is perfect.  The soundtrack perfectly mirrors the time period (musically and lyrically, from ""Rags to Riches"" to ""My Way"").  Joe Pesci is a revelation.  Of course he could be a thug, but they way his Tommy DeVito enters every shot as an unknown factor -- ""Is he going to snap?"" is the only thing we can think of -- gives the film an edge that would not have been the same with another actor.  Robert DeNiro is, of course, terrific, and Ray Liotta inhabits the character unlike he's done since.But the real star is Martin Scorsese.  Just when it seems that ""Raging Bull"" would be his apex, I think ""GoodFellas"" may top it, on the basis of scope and technique.  It's not just a man as in ""Raging Bull"" and ""Taxi Driver,"" his other legendary works.  It's a whole lifestyle, a way of being.  And it follows three decades of a ""family's"" rise and fall.  And there is never a slow or tedious moment.  The movie is raw action.  Whether it's the hellish tracking shots or the point of view shots or the way the trunk lets off an evil red glow, everything is for a reason.  And the double voice-over technique is brilliant, because it gives two different perspectives of mafia life.""GoodFellas"" does not try to glorify the mob life... it just presents it as it is, blood and all.  And 20 years from now tell me if ""Ordinary People"" and ""Dances With Wolves"" are that great..."
24916,False,"If there was a film that could come close to being better than my favourite film of all time, it would be GoodFellas. This film is so well done, it left me thinking about it for days. Martin Scorsese took a credible true story (based on the book ""Wiseguy""), a superb cast (Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta, Joe Peschi, Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino) and did his usual magic creating interesting shots and a film that flows very smoothly.Some might say that GoodFellas has nothing on either of the first two Godfather films, however, I have to disagree. The Godfather films were based on a family and the happenings throughout the years, while GoodFellas takes a much simpler story about a local group of Mafioso and the problems they have with themselves. Where the Godfather films trace the wars between the mafioso, GoodFellas traces the wars within a single group of mafioso.I don't think there has ever been a more abrupt and to the point opening sequence than the one in this film. It prepares you for the violence and vulgarity to come, although there was less of it than I thought there would be. Contrary to what others say about this being a showcase for the ugly side of the mob, there are more great dramatic scenes than violent ones.Perhaps this was the best film of the 90's, but who really cares. GoodFellas will remain in my mind as one of the greatest of all time, and as such I fully recommend this film to all. Watch for Samuel L. Jackson in a small bit role (I believe he even says a word or two).9/10 stars."
24917,False,"Goodfellas has everything a film watcher could want- Comedy, Drama, Violence, Sex, ETC.  The only difference is that this film also is based on a true story and that adds to the greatness of Scorcese's picture making. Not only that, the performances are totally top notch (only De Niro gets to much acclaim for what is really a co-starring role) including Liotta, Bracco, and Pesci.  If there is a movie for thrill seekers and film buffs, this one IS for you."
24918,False,"What can't be said about this film?  It is the single best motion picture made this decade.  It shows every aspect of why Martin Scorsese is the greatest living American director.  It would have been simple enough to make a small budget gangster film from Pillegi's book, but Scorsese wanted to give us more than that.  Reading the book makes me want to see the film again and vice versa.  If anyone ever wants to know what Judas felt like just like at Ray Liotta's eyes at the conclusion of the film.  He's right, he's just an average schnook who's sold his whole life out for nothing. What more can be said?"
24919,False,"This is one of my favourite films, I've seen it dozens of times but I still find it hard to watch.  It's so unpleasant, the heroes are ruthless murderers, Joe Pesci is particularly horrible as the psychopathic Tommy. Everything about this film is impeccably made, the cinematography is perfect, the soundtrack is brilliant, the acting superb but I still find myself hiding during some of the more gruesome moments.  A classic film, but not a pleasant one."
24920,False,"Goodfellas is without a doubt my favorite American film in the last 20 years......hell I'm pushed to think of a better one ever. Scorcese hit all the right notes with this film. The use of music was spot on....the camera work was dazzling....who can forget the tracking shot as they walk into the restaurant via the back door and take their seats front and centre. The performances were uniformly wonderful....yeah, like Scorcese makes films without great central performances...I think not. I pity Ray Liotta....where could he go after the performance he gave in Goodfellas?....Turbulence!! It reminds me of Ken Wahl after his role in The Wanderers. The guy shoulda been a star but it was never to be. Well there's nothing more for me to say that hasn't been said many times before about this amazing film. I just wish films of this quality were the rule and not the exception."
24921,False,"I love this film for a # of reasons. It's script is unbelievable. Scorcese is not afraid to say f!@# all the time. The acting is so believable and superb. This is definitely Joe Pesci's best performance, and DeNiro's second best. (Next to Vito Corleone in Godfather Part 2) Also great performances by Paul Sorvino, Ray Liotta, and Lorraine Bracco. This film stayed with me for days. I couldn't stop thinking about Henry, Tommy, and Jimmy. I started feeling like I could get away with things. I even started thinking cops were the bad guys! This feelings eventually went away, but still this was a very good film, and it was robbed of The Best Picture Academy Award. I guess it is just another example of the Academy screwing Martin Scorcese."
24922,False,"Great movie, what can I say. Got 9/10 from me. Smooth directing and plot. Joe Pesci Is great, somebody could have nightmares from him, he sure can act quite menacing. Liottas best Role (ever ?) De Niro great as usual, other actors way over average. These kind of movies come only 10 in a Century !"
24923,False,"GoodFellas is the greatest gangster movie of all time because it does not pander to the audience like the Godfather's which glamorize the gangsters and the gangster lifestyle without showing a more realistic mob. GoodFellas is based on a true story which makes it more effective.  The acting by Dinero, Pesci, and Liota are extremely realistic and are supported by great supporting actresses and actors like Paul Sorvino and Debbie Mazar.  The soundtrack fits the movie perfectly and helps set the scenes of the greatest gangster movie of all time."
24924,False,"I love the combination of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro, but when you throw Joe Pesci in the mix, you have what I call cinematic magic.  It is one of, if not the best movie of the decade and the performances are simply unforgettable.  Joe Pesci earned the Oscar by playing a role only he could play.  The direction of Martin Scorsese, is simply wonderful making this movie one of my ten best.  Only in ""The Godfather""  made me want to join the mob more.  Its by far a 10 of 10 and a brilliant movie."
24925,False,"GoodFellas, one of my all time favorite movies, is put together in an incredible way.  The cinematography and editing is amazing.  The movie flows better than any movie I've ever seen.  Each shot goes into the next perfectly.  Also the sound and visual images are not cut at the same time in most places, smoothing out the transitions even more.  along with Taxi Driver, it is Scorsese's best picture.  Also, like most Scorsese films, the characters (perhaps with the exception of Tommy) although brutal criminals, are very accesible and understandable.  I can really relate to their feelings.  It is a truly great movie."
24926,False,"This film is truly amazing.  This is what film is all about.  Spectacular direction, excellent acting, and a wonderfully written script.  Every character is engaging and keeps your eyes and ears interested the entire time.  This is my favorite Martin Scorsese film.  He just keeps making great films.  If people say it's overrate it's simply because they don't want to admit just how wonderful this film is.  I've seen it many times and I never lose my interest.  I only wish Ray Liotta had gained more praise for his underrated performance.  He was truly terrific.  I completely believed that he WAS Henry Hill living a life in the mob.  A must to buy!"
24927,False,"Like most of Martin Scorsese's films, ""Goodfellas"" is an example of superior film-making. The fact that this film is on the American Film Institute's top 100 films of all time is no surprise to me. It's low ranking of 94 is a bit disturbing. It sits as close to the bottom as it should to the top of that list. This film gives you a hard, long, candid look of the life of a gangster spanning three decades, without pulling any punches.It is violent to be sure, but not gratuitous, unnecessary violence. How can you tell a convincing tale of life in the mob without getting violent? The narration by Ray Liotta and the style in which the film is presented gives it a very realistic feel that is not easily achieved on the fantastic subject matter. Based on the novel by Nicholas Pileggi, this is a harrowing true story, and despite its incredible turns, we know in our hearts it's all too real. Many scenes from this film are burned into my mind, and that can be attributed partially to the story, but mostly to the convincing performances by all involved.Joe Pesci received an Oscar for best supporting actor, but I feel Martin was overlooked unjustly. I'm sure he doesn't make films for the sake of awards, that appears to be the case anyway, but I'm sure the recognition wouldn't have embarrassed him either, and it's a shame. I respect the man and his work, and I feel that this film is his greatest so far."
24928,False,"What a great movie!  Immediately engaging, this movie grabs you from the throat right from the start and never lets go. Through the eyes of Ray Liotta's character, we are introduced into a dizzying world full of memorable characters.The mafia world is at once glamourized, as the young Liotta grows up to become a prominent figure in the family.  Then his dream starts to fall apart as that world of glamour and easy money collapses on him.  Similar in its theme to Scarface, this movie is a level above Stone's masterpiece, more stylish, very nineties and comes with a killer soundtrack.Although you should watch this movie for many reasons, Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro alone are worth the rental price.  Their characters are simply unforgettable."
479435,True,"GoodFellas: pure greatnessInstead of revealing spoilers for you I'm including my reasons for it being my favorite film of alltime1) Great acting(DeNiro, Liotta, Pesci) 2) Great directing(Scorsese is a god) 3) Great dialogue(how am I funny) 4) Awesome use of the word f*ck and f*cko! 5) Great narration by Liotta(Hill) and Bracco(K.Hill)THERE. If you watch the film you'll see I'm not a person short of words but just a big fan of the movie GOODFELLAS!Da MovieDude"
479436,True,"Martin Scorsese's stunning gangster film Goodfellas is the true story of Henry Hill, a man that wanted to be a gangster for as long as he can remember, and who lived as a gangster for a significant portion of his life. Scorsese seems to suggest that his tendency toward a life of crime comes as a result of an unhappy childhood, particularly the brutal beatings that he received from his father as a kid. Ray Liotta gives an excellent performance as Henry Hill, and Robert DeNiro is just a bad-ass in the film. He makes an awesome gangster, and he just looks intimidating and interesting and impressive. True, the guy is just a phenomenal actor, but he can also play extremely opposite roles, such as the one he played in Scorsese's Mean Streets in 1973, as well as the nutcase Travis Bickle in Scorsese's Taxi Driver. Joe Pesci, also a Scorsese regular, and also a tremendously diverse actor, plays the part of the undeniably likeable but quick-tempered and highly ambitious Tommy, one of the most violent gangsters portrayed in the film (by the way, his similarity to Edward G. Robinson's performance as Rico Bandello in Little Caesar (1930) is extensive and unmistakable). On a trivial note, look for Scorsese's mother playing the part of Tommy's loving mother (almost a staple in Italian cinema) in the film. It's interesting that for a good portion of her screen time, she is telling stories from the past, exactly as she did in Scorsese's rather short film Italianamerican, which starred his mother and father as themselves.Scorsese clearly sees something of himself in the young Henry Hill, given his fairly impoverished and physically unhealthy childhood in New York's Little Italy, where he was always fascinated by organized crime. His unique and expressive direction works perfectly to present the story of the life of Henry Hill, with the overall purpose of showing what life in the Mafia is like. The power, the money, the women, the cars, the color coordinated wardrobe, the special treatment by just about everyone, everything that comes as a benefit of being a gangster. On the other hand, the dark side of organized crime is equally presented. We see the loyalty turned to betrayal, the senseless murders, the self-aggrandizing acts that lead to one's own downfall (especially seen in the way that Tommy kills a `made' man named Bask), the occasional crackdown by the law, etc. But even when in prison, they get extremely favorable treatment, with their quarters, their food, and pretty much everything else about their treatment.(spoilers) Even the extensive length of the film serves to increase the effectiveness of this presentation of gangster life, because it provides time for Scorsese to completely immerse the audience in the world of the Mafia, rather than tell about the life of some gangster with a story that is over in 90 minutes. The movie spans a time period of about three decades, from Henry Hill's first involvement with the Mafia, basically as an errand boy, until his eventual betrayal of his betrayers, leaving him stuck to live the rest of his life `like a schnook.' Earlier in the film, DeNiro's character, James Conway, tells the young Henry Hill that he had learned a valuable lesson from his first run-in with the police - `Never rat on your friends, and ALWAYS keep your mouth shut.' Henry is proud of this, and even at the end of the film, when he opens his mouth and rats on his friends, it is clear that it is not the way that he wanted it all to end. The tragedy here is that he has to spend the rest of his life living in a way that he always despised, as a `normal' person.Even as Henry goes to the police, Scorsese is still illustrating the practices and realities of the Mafia. Henry notes that the cops talked to him, which assured him that they were not associated with the Mafia, because `goodfellas' (this is what the gangsters called each other - `You'll like this guy, he's a goodfella.') would have just killed him. He wouldn't have even heard anything. The Italian influence in the film is obviously unmistakable, both in the stereotypical (and, in reality, generally incorrect) involvement with the Mafia as well as everything from the way that they dress to the strong family bonds and the delicious meals. Goodfellas is an uncompromising and brutally straightforward look at the inner workings of the Mafia that makes no effort to make anything easy to swallow. I've heard people complain about gratuitous violence in the movie, such as when Henry walks up to some guy on his driveway and pistol-whips him for sexually assaulting his sister. This is crap, of course, because the guy got exactly what he deserved. I think they should implement pistol-whipping in the US court system as a common punishment for sexual assault. The violence is not put into a movie like this to impress the younger male audience that looks for that, it's put here because that's the way the Mafia works. This is realism, not audience manipulation, and the spectacularly effective result is a tremendous accomplishment."
479437,True,"WARNING, WARNING THIS IS A SPOILER This is a classic tale of 3 decades in the mafia, it follows the life  of small time hustler Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), who befriends the ""legendary"" Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) & ""crazy"" Tommy D (Joe Pesci). Hill's dream was always to become a gangsta& this comes true in the 1950's, when he joins the local mob run by the local don Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino). It goes from there into the 60's, 70's & finally the 80's. Some time in the film they pull off the greatest robbery in American history, they steal a COOL $6 million. It all comes to an end when Hill starts with drugs & Paulie turns his back on him, Hill fearing for his life ""rats"" on Conway & Cicero, they go to prison & Hill spends the rest of his life under police protection! It is based on a true story & his 1 of my favourite movies off all time. For any more info pleaze feel free to e-mail me"
479438,True,"The Film tells the story of a boy who grows up in a poor family and his greatest wish is to be a gangster and later his career in the clan The Actors are really good, particularly Joe Pesci made a fantastic Job. But apart from some very few scenes is there no tension, I felt like I knew every time what happens next. At the end i felt like ""uhhh finally"". 139 Minutes are too long for this film. The camera and the screenplay is really good, the sound is bad. There aren't much emotions, there is nothing to remember. I think Goodfellas is only worth to view cause of the really good actors, but there is nothing to remember, the story is kind of flat and there are nearly no emotions during the film."
479439,True,"The first time I saw ""Goodfellas"", I didn't realize it was based on the Nichlas Pileggi book 'Wiseguy'. A lot of stuff seemed so familiar, and of course, the name Henry Hill was the tip-off, a non-Italian in the world of Mafioso high rollers and hit men. I read the book shortly after it came out, and the movie seemed to come out very quickly after. I don't remember a whole lot about the book now, but some of the things that stand out are the Air France job, the Lufthansa heist, and that bit about feeding a guy to a lion. Oh yeah, and the burial, exhumation and reburial of Billy Batts. You have to admit, ""Goodfellas"" has the best ba-da-bing opening of all time when Tommy (Joe Pesci) goes berserk on Batts in the car trunk and just keeps wailing.I've read a few of the other comments in the reviews section for this picture, and can only chuckle at a few of the naive posters who think that what happens on screen here is forced and not very believable. I can only surmise that they didn't grow up in New York or it's suburb environs, because mob rub-outs were a staple on the front pages of the New York Daily News and The Post throughout the Sixties. Usually they more closely resembled Michael Corleone's first hit in the Italian restaurant in ""The Godfather"", but nevertheless, this kind of brutality did occur. Although I have to say, the way Tommy whacked Michael Imperioli was a little over the top.I guess the most memorable scene in the movie for me was Pesci giving Ray Liotta the business in that 'who's funny' routine. For first time viewers, you're not really sure where Tommy's going to take things because he's such a loose cannon. Then suddenly, Pesci calls himself on it, and you know full well he was playing around with the new kid. The character Pesci was portraying, real life mobster Tommy DeSimone, was in fact a young aspiring gangster with psychopathic tendencies specializing in truck hijacking and stolen goods.So for those who think ""Goodfellas"" is the best gangster flick ever, fair enough, but putting it up against the first two 'Godfathers' is a little bit of a stretch for my money. I also prefer the Coen Brothers' take on crime in ""Miller's Crossing"". But this one's based on a true story, and you can't get more real than some of the outrageous things that happened in the life of wise guy Henry Hill. For an outsider, he could be a real goombah."
479440,True,"""Goodfellas"" is so realistic you feel like watching a documentary about the mob: the narration is straight-forward, it doesn't try to use big words, or a rich vocabulary, gangsters proudly talk like the lucky scumbags they are. As for the others, the honest guys, like you and me, they are simply labeled as losers, how could someone like a script where he's almost insulted? Well, just think about this, insulted by whom? by a wannabe big shot who thinks he's the king of the world simply because he doesn't need to stand in a queue, or can get the best table to his girlfriend in the restaurant? the genius of the script is that you're almost envying the protagonists in the beginning, the whole first act has a sort of joyful atmosphere where everything is fun, even when it's not. It almost makes you drool about this life where everything is easy: money, girls, sex, fun, power, respect, when you, poor schmuck, has to struggle to live a crappier life ...But they ARE criminals, no doubt about that, they're cheaters, they're robbers, murderers, they cheat their wives, they stab in the back, and the only honor they have is not to ""rat on your friends"", as if there were friends in this business anyway ... even the rules are corrupted from the beginning, why shouldn't you rat? if you're put in a position where you might do it, you're already a target ... it's a nasty, stinking, horrific world, we're proud not to belong to at the end of the film, and that's the power of the script. You follow these characters who seem cool, nice, funny (like a clown, or just like that) and you end up feeling guilty for that. The movie makes you question this weird appeal you feel to gangsters, even one of the first lines of the movie is quite significant : ""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster"" ... we're like, wow! This movie goes ahead, it shouts loudly what ""The Godfather"" was trying to whisper ... from the first words of the 'Wags to Riches' song, we're literally plunged into a world, where we share the dreams of a character who wants to be a gangster, as if it was the most honorable profession. The movie doesn't even question that, it's almost normal to want to be a gangster. Scorsese has a twisted provocative approach in the beginning of the movie and it works perfectly, because it makes the ending all the more bittersweet, or all the more ironic.Which takes me to the last lines, compare them with the first. The character's story arc concludes with these powerful lines : ""I'm an average nobody... get to live the rest of my life like a schnook"", this line is like a last slap in the face to the other schmucks who didn't realize during the movie that these guys were ALL already average nobodies, and probably worse than that, even when everything was fine ... the last grin on Hill's face after he did it 'his way' (a reference to the ending credits song) is to highlight the ridiculousness of the situation where he's trying to persuade himself he ever was someone before, but he was nothing ... he didn't exist in the papers, he didn't exist in society, he did nothing, and the only wise decision he took was to save his skin by 'ratting' on his 'friends'. This is a movie about ultimate losers, about a cruel, violent and nasty world where sooner or later, you LOSE. But you don't lose because crime does not pay, let's not be that naive. You lose because this so-called fellowship is based on a fallacious etiquette that makes friendship and loyalty totally inconceivable, at least in the long term. Consequently, when you watch the movie a second time, you realize that everything is fake from the beginning, the ending makes the irony even more palpable ... hell, the irony is even in the title, 'Goodfellas' ...Just like its glorious predecessor, ""The Godfather"", the script is one of the most remarkable elements of the films, especially when combined with an incredible editing : you jump from a memorable scene to another, you're like watching a time capsule of the criminal world, it's an entertaining journey into crime that doesn't show how crime is fun or entertaining, but just to highlight in a more powerful way the cruelty of this world that looked so joyful, so cool in the beginning (and I don't even mention the acting)... In other words, the script is provocative, ironic and entertaining, what do you want more? better written dialogs? that's not the point. ""City Lights"" didn't need dialogs to be considered a masterpiece, nor does ""Goodfellas"" where the vocabulary is so particular, it's like another character from the film.""Goodfellas"", Marty's masterpiece is the quintessential Gangster film, not because it makes you want to be a gangster, but because it gives you two feelings in common with gangsters, envy and fear ... and a third one at the end, which is guilt."
479441,True,"Possible SPOILERS!i saw this before i'd seen Godfather 2+3, and is more of a personal favourite largely because of Pesci's performance. he manages to be both scary and funny, but what is special is that we feel both relief and sadness when he is killed. Brasco also gives a dual performance, changing from feisty single girl to terrified, paranoid housewife with great ease. as always De Niro is on top form, and Liotta manages to give 3 distinct personalities-his own, Conway's and Tommy's.Each of the characters falls from grace effectively, with Henry becoming what he always dreaded at the end, a suburban nobody. the violence is tense and bloody, the plot gripping, if not complex, making it easily one of the best films of the nineties. filled with memorable images and dialogue. 9 out of 10"
479442,True,"This is easily my all time favorite movie. The pacing is electric and the acting is fantastic. The mix of dark dark humor, drama and action is fantastic. Everyone always talks about Pesci's great performance and rightfully so, but DeNiro gives the second best performance of his career (after Raging Bull) in this movie. Understated but fantastic. Ray Liotta is also excellent, although somewhat overshadowed by Pesci and DeNiro. The last 25 minutes of the movie where Liotta's character is trying to unload guns on his ""Pittsburgh connection"" and get a cocaine shipment out the door all while preparing a large Italian meal for his whole family is amazing. Many people tell me that I am nuts for liking this movie because it glorifies the mafia life, but I think it does just the opposite. If you have not seen this movie, rent it immediately."
479443,True,"How good a movie was this. Jeez! It is just one of the greatest films ever.It is filled with actors in their prime. In their very prime. De Niro! Liotta! Pesci! Bracco! Sorvino etc. and those bit players - jeez this film has the best bit players ever.And a new direction for Scorsese visually and in terms of editing. This was probably the film that commenced the sensory overload thing. He continued this with Cape Fear, took it to another level with Casino and then went crazy with it in Wolf Of Wall Street.The ""funny how"" scene was brilliant. Yes. It was so perfectly rendered. Not just Pesci and Liotta. But the people sitting next to them - it is amazing how their reactions change from drunken glee to utter discomfort.It does glorify gangster life to a certain extent, for a good part of the film. Of course the ending and Henry Hill's family life are like warnings. I guess the film is so damn entertaining and stylish, you tend to overlook the fact that it also a cautionary tale.After multiple viewings, I think the first half of the film is exaggerated but well made and entertaining nonetheless. But it is the second half when Hill and Karen's marriage begin to unravel that I really liked. Lorraine Bracco is on another level. What an actress.And after watching Goodfellas and Casino, how can a person take Di Caprio, Ryan Gosling, Tom Hardy etc seriously as gangsters or even leading men? Its just been made and edited with so much love. They must worked their asses off in the editing room.I watched this on Blu-ray. The film looks great on Blu-ray.(10/10)"
479444,True,"This movie has insatiable action, from the get-go, and puts the viewer in the front seat with the characters. The movie is well narrated by the main character, as it's his actual experiences within La Cosa Nostra. Even though the Italian mafia at the time was feared and immensely powerful, this film shows the psychology of the characters, and it displays all facets of their lives. We usually only receive one perspective; however this film shows off the relationships of Henry Hill from all aspects. It starts when he was a young boy, and with a surname like Hill, one wonders how he could be part of an underground Italian organization? These are the details the movie focuses on, the finer specifics, it's not all gun blazing and assassinations. I'd advise this flick, because it exhibits the interactions, relationships, hardships, choices, struggles of an individual rising through the ranks of a crime family."
479445,True,"Let me start off by saying: I love Martin Scorsese's work, as far as I saw 3 movies from him: Shutter Island, Wolf of Wall Street and The Departed. All were awesomely directed, as well as acted. I decided to watch Goodfellas, since I want to see all the classics, like I did with the great Pulp Fiction and I could go on...Hands down, one of the best acting and storytelling I have ever seen. It's full of tasty dialogues, quotes, from awesome characters, fantastic costumes and all with great music. The ""Intro Scene"" is from the middle of the movie, where a man is getting killed in a car by Henry and his two mob friends, does it's justice: it pulls you in on this fantastic journey with so many great scenes, and the shocking ones (like Tommy's head shot scene) too. 9/10-very very close to the perfect 10"
479446,True,"""Good fellas"" is a true story about Robert De Niro who plays ""Henry Hill,"" a small time gangster in New York City who works his way to higher power of the mob. The movie takes places around the time frame of 1955 to 1980 in New York City. The film is based on the book, ""Wise Guy"" published in 1986 by Nicholas Pileggi. Produced by, Warner Bros, the film won one Oscar award for Best actor in supporting role by actor Joe Pecsi. It was also followed by winning 41 awards along with 23 nominations. The movie grossed at $46.8 million with a budget of $25 Mil. Henry Hill takes action in a robbery, where his two associates Jimmy Conway and Tommy De Vito begin to kill everyone who took part in the robbery. Henry hill is affected very negatively by the actions of his fellow mobsters and will do everything in his power to bring them down. My Favorite part of the movie is when Robert De Niro begins the movie with the words said by Henry Hill himself, ""For as long as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster. To me that was better than being president of the United States. To be a gangster was to own the world."" The movie condones a lot of violence, drugs, and sex but never one time does the main character turn his back on his dream of becoming a gangster."
479447,True,"Goodfellas. We may think of them as our neighbors who wave to us while they mow their lawn or maybe the nice couple that plays golf down the road. But in this case the Goodfellas, the Wiseguys are trigger happy Tommy DeVito(Joe Pesci), straight talker Jimmy Conway(Robert DeNiro)and cocaine snorting Henry Hill(Ray Liotta). This film is one of Scorsese's masterpieces. It has the originality of ""White Heat"" and realism in a category all its own. Its writing by the books original author Nick Peleggi and by director Martin Scorsese is wonderful. Its cinematography is right on par. And its acting is superb. This movie is one of the best films about the mob life and arguably one of the best films ever made. It has a blend of comedy, darkness and everyday situations which is one of my favorite parts of the film."
479448,True,"I am addicted to gang movies and this movie is top 2 after Godfather for me. Especially, Ray Liotta is ""Born"" for this role i guess. Describing a child who really loves doing gang stuff is really very utopic inside a gang family. Very special thanks to Nicholas Pileggi and Martin Scorsese for this movie. This movie is a masterpiece for me and every crime & gang style movie lover has to watch this. Best section of the film i love is when Joe Pesci makes a very good joke to Ray Liotta and second moment is when Joe Pesci shoots a guy for a very soft argument just because to claim that he is the boss. I started to think that Joe Pesci is also born to be a ""gang"" after i watched this movie. Watch, you will definitely love it!"
479449,True,Goodfellas remains a mystery to me. Why do people think this movie is good. All it is is Ray Liotta's bad life in the mafia. There was no reason to make a movie about this guys life. He basically becomes a drug addict and cheats on his wife for 2 and a half hours. Goodfellas was very boring there was very little excitement or much of anything really. Joe Pesci was the only good part of the movie and he gets killed so there's not much to like about this movie. I'd just stay away from it altogether don't waste your time. Having this movie ranked so high on the top 250 is unbelievable. I hope I'm not alone saying this but I think Goodfellas was just awful. The story was horrible the actors had nothing to work with maybe next they should pick a more interesting mafia guy to do a movie about. Actually one thing I did enjoy was them playing Eric Clapton through out that's the only good thing I have to say about this movie. Hopefully the mafia won't come after me after writing this review.
479450,True,"Let me start off by saying that the movie was terribly downgraded by the use of narrative throughout. Scorcese did the narrative technique five years later with Casino and it ruined the film. Imagine hat a mess The Godfather or Scarface would have been with wall-to-wall narrative. So unnecessary and it takes away the feel of the movie. It's actually a crutch.That said, Liotta turned in a Best Actor Oscar worthy performance.I don't think he was even nominated. Peschi deserved his Oscar for Best Suppoting actor. Both guys were intense and turned in flawless performances. DeNiro, oddly enough, turned in a sub par performance. His character was very understated and showed noting of the deranged killer he was to have portrayed. Lots of great scenes and period pieces. The rock n' roll soundtrack worked well. Lots of tunes from the Rolling Stones' 1972 album, ""Exile on Main Street"", as well as other Stones songs. But oh, what could have been. Take away the narrative and allow the characters to develop within the context of the film and it's a classic."
479451,True,"Brilliance. This film reeks of brilliance. From the direction, to the screenplay, to the cast. Everything in this film is flawless. But, I shall go into more detail to explain this film's brilliance.Mobster films are one of my favorite film genres, and I am sure many people share that same liking. They always produce a weird sense of suspense, intrigue, and mystification. The Godfather emblazoned the mobster genre, marking a true cinematic farce and a very good milestone in film making. After the Godfather, many people tried out their hands on mobster films, but none equaled the impact and quality of the Godfather until Scorsese made Goodfellas. Goodfellas biggest quality is that it is based on a true story. This makes the film even more interesting and likable, seeing as most of the events portrayed really happened. The story of Henry Hill was a perfect foreground.On the acting side of things, there is nothing to really to complain about. The actors gave powerhouse performances, particularly Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta. Joe Pesci really gives a genuinely terrifying yet hilarious character performance. He is truly believable and ultimately ruthless. Liotta is spectacular. No more to add to that. he really showed the world that he could truly act when he did this movie. As for Robert DeNiro, he shines in every scene he is in, but my only quibble is the fact we didn't get to see more of his character. He seemed interesting, but we didn't really get any insight. Lorraine Bracco has an annoying voice, but she does give a great, passionate and sympathetic performance as Liotta's wife.The direction by Scorsese is flawless. his choices were brilliant. he really gives a documentary style of direction, as if we are there observing the everyday life of the mafia. His fade outs are poignant, and his choices for the background music are a plus.As a whole, Goodfellas gives a great insight into the mafia. It throws away the stereotypes we usually associate with those who are in the mafia, and it really has an impact. With terrific actors,top notch direction, an excellent, precise screenplay, and a great story, what is there not to like about this film? I highly recommend this film to everyone, and it should become a part of your movie library IMMEDIATELY."
479452,True,"Goodfellas is my second favourite all time film. Just after Scarface. This film is just absolutely brilliant. I originally watched Goodfellas back in the late 90s when my dad had an old VHS of it. I fell in love with the film right there and then. I didn't get the DVD until by birthday in 2010. Unfortunately, it was the annoying double sided disc. You get the first 70 minutes of the film on one side, and the last 70 minutes on the other. This means you have to flip the disc over half way through which is really irritating. You half to take the disc out, turn it around and then put it back in just after the sequence where Tommy kills Spider. I haven't got the 2 disc edition yet, but I really want it. The film was inspired by true story and is also based on the book Wiseguys by Nicholas Pileggi. He co wrote the script with the director of this masterpiece Martin Scorsese.Ray Liotta gives his greatest performance in this film as the lead character Henry Hill. He is just absolutely brilliant. The sequence where he has to break the wall at the end of the film and talk to the camera was just brilliant. Robert De Niro gives one amazing performance as well as the infamous gangster Jimmy Conway. However, it is Joe Pesci who steals this movie. He is just absolutely terrifying as Tommy DeVito. Definitely someone you don't want to mess with. The way he just shoots Spider in the foot and later on kills him was scary. This is because he just acts like there is nothing wrong with his actions. Joe Pesci won a rightly deserved academy award for this film. I think he does just as good, if not even better as Nicky Santoro in another Martin Scorsese masterpiece Casino.Lorraine Bracco gives a great performance in this film as well as Karen Hill. She scares the hell out of me every time she shouts. Another amazing actor in this film is Paul Sorvino who plays Paul Cicero (Paulie). There are several scenes of brutal violence in this film but don't worry its nothing to disturbing. The sequence where Henry bashes the face in of a man who tried to rape his wife is sick. Another shocking sequence is when Tommy and Jimmy beat the living hell out of Billy Batts who is played very well by Frank Vincent.Goodfellas stands the test of time as being one of the greatest films ever made. If you are going to purchase the DVD then get the full 2 disc edition. I heard you get two audio commentaries and several documentaries. The choices of the music in this film is absolutely brilliant. It truly is the second greatest film ever made. (P.S. the film also contains around 300 F words).BBFC consumer advice: Rated 18 for strong language, bloody violence and hard drug use."
479453,True,"MArtin Scorsese. My favorite Director... He has put all his work in to this movie. It was brilliant and breath taking. This movie is one of the best movies i've seen in years. The Scenes were perfect and Robert Deniro did a very good job. You are going to be thrilled and amazed when you see this. AFter Seeing this movie i want to be a director just like Martin Scorsese. This movie is like a piece of art. If you didn't see this movie, your missing out all the fun. The story was great. It is about a little boy who wants to be a Gangster.. and now he's all grown up and his wish has come true. He hangs out with Joe Pesci (He was the best in this film) and Robert DeNiro. He robs places and he gets a girl and marries. I'll rate this film a... Story: 10/10 Character: 10/10 Scenes: 10/10 10/10. I'll rate it 11 if i have to..."
479454,True,"Director Martin Scorsese has a specialty when it comes to doing movies. His true specialty is mob movies. Goodfella, though most people call it his best, isn't my favorite of his. But it is a great film, filled with great performances, and many memorable things about it. Goodfellas is the true story of Henry Hill(played by Ray Liotta)and how he brings himself up to the higher mob levels. Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro plays some wise guys too. The film also shows his marriage and how it falls down.Scorsese is a master with mob movies. I mean this is the man who did Casino, The Departed, Gangs of New York, and I think there are others. Maybe i'm wrong. Casino was my favorite of his films. But Goodfellas is a great film too.Goodfellas was nominated for Best picture. It probably should've won. Though I can't remember what else came out that year. The performance by Joe Pesci and whoever plays Liotta's wife are terrific. Goodfellas is very interesting, and real. My family is Italian, so I also find this movie to be believable. Trust me, we're not in the mob. Though everyone thinks my dad is. Goodfellas is almost the greatest mob movie ever made. But barely doesn't make it. Still a great film though.Goodfellas: A+"
479455,True,"Godfellas is an incredible, relentless experience about the single-minded pursuit of crime. A Brooklyn boy (Ray Liotta) works his way up the mafia hierarchy, until every thing goes sour.The film is a scorching saga of criminality run amok, dictating every handshake and tainting every relationship. Cinematically it is lethal and seductive, drawing us into the evily glamorous embrace of the mob lifestyle  but, like Faust, these characters have hell to pay. More than a decade later, no less than 22 members of the cast would be featured in the acclaimed mob-themed TV series The Sopranos. The word ""f**k"" is used in the film approximately 300 times, ninth most in film."
479456,True,"Haven't we seen it all many times before? A boy wants to be a gangster, he becomes a gangster, he rises in ranks, gets very influential, very much money, girls, wives, drugs, killings, robberies and it all becomes to much for him. He can't cope and in the end he is redempted. To me it was just another gangster-movie.Anyway, I found it enjoyable; the first half was good entertainment, and I found myself very interested in continuing watching. The story of Henry Hill was somewhat fascinating although it felt like I had seen it before. But then again, after some 100 minutes I'd had enough. The killings, drugs, money and ""gangster-stuff"" had done it's time and I just wanted to see how it ended and be over with it.It must be said that I'm not a big fan of gangster-movies or Scorsese in general, but I can see that this is a good movie, although weaker than ""The Departed"", a very good, more original and Scorseses best, movie.In conclusion ""Goodfellas"" is fairly entertaining, a movie I will watch again if it happens to be on TV on a boring day, but I won't buy it on DVD. Goodfellas is good, it's not great, and therefore overrated. 7/10"
479457,True,"One of the most famous lines in Goodfellas is ""Ever since I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster."" It turns out that Goodfellas shows that what one may ultimately want may not be the best for them. As a young boy Henry Hill looked up to the ""gangster"" life. There were many aspects of the ""gangster"" lifestyle that attracted Henry. A gangster does what he wants with no regard to anyone else. Gangsters often operate in groups or ""families."" It was when Henry takes his first job working at the local pizza shop that he was first introduced to the gangster life. Henry witnessed interaction between different gangsters and started to yearn for the lifestyle of a gangster. Henry's yearning became more evident when he began taking on small ""odds and end"" jobs for the owner of the pizza shop. As a man in his early twenties, Henry continues on his quest for what he thought would make the ""perfect"" life as a gangster. The fame associated with the gangsters he witnessed as a young boy is what initially attracted him and now he started to experience the gangster life. Henry continued his experience by continuing to work jobs for mob bosses, such as Frankie Carbone. Henry continued working these ""gangster"" jobs, even after he was disowned by his mother and father. As Henry continued through his twenties, he continued obtaining everything that he wanted, including a gorgeous wife, cars, money, and respect. The wife, the cars and the money are all things that gangsters work hard to obtain and now Henry had obtained them. Henry continued to work hard and to build his wealth, as shown in the scene where Henry and all of his friends are gathered around a table and they dumb a huge bag of money on the table. This was after he and his friends pull off one of the biggest heists in history. With this wealth, Henry began to start new business ventures that would ultimately prove to be bad decisions. Like previously stated, gangsters do whatever they want to do. This sometimes even occurs against the ""boss'"" orders. One of the pivotal parts of the movie is when the boss, Frankie, finds out the Henry went against his wishes and was now in trouble. Frankie helps Henry one last time, and then tells him that he is turning his back on him. This isn't the first time Henry is smacked in the face. Frankie turning his back on Henry begins to show that Henry could potentially be on the down fall. It was after this point that Henry begins to watch his back wherever he goes. This even occurs around his friends, Jimmy and Tommy. This type of behavior might be seen as unordinary, especially around people that are friends. Another pivotal part of the film is towards the end. It is after Henry and his family go into the witness protection program. Henry and his family enter the program because Henry ""folds"" on Frankie and Jimmy. You can see the tension through a high angle shot that is focusing on Frankie and Jimmy in the courtroom. This truly shows that Henry holds the power. Henry and his family enter the program and are immediately moved away from New York. The viewer is able to see that Henry has lost everything. As Henry is on the porch, the camera begins to zoom in and Henry says that he is now a ""nobody."" This shows that he has come so far, and at the end he is not what he wanted to be. Henry looks as though he has lost everything and like he has hit rock bottom. Goodfellas shows that you may want something, but it may not always be the best choice for you. Much like the film Scarface, it turns out that the money, the fame, and the gangster life it not a good decision. ""Ever since I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster"" was not a good choice for Henry. He lost everything and now feels that he is a ""nobody."" It turned out that all of Henry's hard work and dedication to be a gangster did not get him what he wanted. Ultimately, it made him a ""nobody."""
479458,True,"A long film about ""Italian"" crime in New York in the 1950-1980 period, and a good one at that. It shows the brutality and the extreme male chauvinism of these gangsters who are ready to sell anything, steal anything, kill anyone in order to make money, and as for killing, to satisfy their insatiable thirst for blood, to satisfy their unquenchable hunger for violence. It also shows, rather on the side because it is not the main object, how justice and before it the police are managing their gang-spirit, splitting their unity and getting the weaker ones to become protected witnesses, and it works: these criminals prefer being hidden away by the Justice Department for decades rather than going away in prison for even longer periods of time. The film is well done: Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci are quite acceptable. Ray Liotta on the other hand appears slightly weak when confronted to the other two, and he has to be since he is the side-kick, and an essential one at that, of both of them. One shortcoming though: even if the police managed to more or less bring the Italians back in line, the film is absolutely silent about the fact that the various traffics and particularly drugs were then abandoned to another mafia, probably even more dangerous, i.e. the Blacks and the Porto Ricans and other Latinos.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"
479459,True,"This is my favorite Scorsese film.Every time I watch it I'm transported away into a world of fun,crime and tragedy.This is due to the excellent direction and the terrific cast.Great acting we have here.Robert De Niro,Rey Liotta and Joe Pesci are simply outstanding in their roles.You have the feeling you're watching real gangsters do what they do best-have fun.Their whole life as Scorsese sees it is non stop fun with the only difference that their concept of fun is a little different than the one of average people.They steal,drink,curse and kill all for the fun of it.It's their way of life.As Henry says they think of ordinary people as a low life scum.It is they who are smart and score the big cash with no difficulty at all.A simply unique portrayal of organized crime which looks absolutely accurate.My favorite character is Tommy De Vito for whom Joe Pesci should have won an Oscar.Simply outstanding work and one of the best movie characters for me ever.Goodfellas is truly a work of art and it is always a pleasure to view this modern masterpiece in which bad people are the law."
479460,True,"With Martin Scorsese getting a lot of acclaim this past year due to the amazing film ""The Departed"" its a good time to go back 16 years earlier and revisit his epic masterpiece Goodfellas. This film, which was robbed of the Oscar for Best picture in favor of Dances With Wolves, stands out as a movie that people will be talking about for decades to come. Its not just that the script and every performance by the actors was Oscar worthy, its also the directing by Scorsese that puts this film over the top. Any film school worth its weight will spend many hours taking this film apart frame by frame. The Camera work, the editing, the placement of music- this film stands out as one of the greatest films of all time. Can anybody forget the scene where Hill's character is ushered through the nightclub with his date? Can anybody who hears the chorus from Layla by Eric Clapton ever not think about the amazing scene that accompanies it? The performance by Joe Pesci is one of the greatest of all time. The character is revolting and yet compelling at the same time. Its very hard to get an audience to feel both emotions and when it works, its brilliant.Now add to this the fact that this story is based on the true life of a real person named Henry Hill and it makes this movie even more interesting to watch. If you have not yet seen this movie, do your self a favor and go rent it. You won't regret it."
479461,True,"The themes of this extraordinary film are in fact quite ordinary when you think about it. The wish that Henry Hill has to be respected and to have all of his desires fulfilled are wishes that we all can relate to. The fact that he has to lie, cheat and steal and in some cases kill to get it, will probably not relate to many but in Henry's world it is just as ordinary as brushing your teeth. Martin Scorsese paints a portrait of a man who wants it all but is somehow unwilling to pay the price.The character Henry Hill, based on a real person, is weak in spirit. He doesn't seem to be ruthless enough to be a gangster and it will eventually spell his doom. Ray Liotta gives an excellent performance that really shows range. He has played bad guys before but also basically decent men like his role in ""Dominick and Eugene"" and ""Corrina, Corrina"". Here he covers both sides. He is immensely nasty to everybody who tries to steal from him but is also quite sympathetic when it comes to looking out for his family. His wife, played by Lorraine Bracco, is not really a criminal but she is turned on by crime and the fact that Henry kills for a living is not something that bothers her in the beginning.There are several good supporting performances in this movie but to name just the really important: 1) Robert De Niro as Jimmy Conway (even though he has top billing). This is not one of his best roles but he is an important figure in the last part of the movie and the way he reacts to the death of somebody really close to him is quite frightening but then again that's no big surprise. 2) Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito. What can you say except: Bravo! Nobody could have played this totally evil character better. And finally Paul Sorvino as Paul. His may not be the most flamboyant role but he does have some eccentricacies that are quite amusing and unlike Marlon Brando in The Godfather, he has a more relaxed performing style and he is therefore more credible as a real person.The superb editing of Thelma Schoonmaker must also be credited for making this film such an exhilarating experience. Three hours seem like a half in this film and it's nice that she just won her second Oscar for the Aviator.The truth is that even though Scorsese has made bad movies his track record is the absolute best for any filmmaker. So let's hope that he does something outstanding very soon as he has been in kind of a slump lately."
479462,True,"Spoilers((( Martin Scorsese created this brilliant masterwork in 1990 and made a new important chapter in gangster movie history. Starring the top-notch actors Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci this movie is based on the true story of Henry Hill and his gangster career that stands as one of history's most magnificent mob stories.Henry Hill is a local boy who's been working for the mob since early days, now being an adult he still serves for them. His since-school-days (although they never went to school) friend Tommy DeVito is a pre Italian maniac. And there's Jimmy Conway, the man who puts these two fellas up together, and is doing some of the worst crimes New York City has ever seen. But soon Henry is put in jail and everything that has always been so bright and okay, suddenly goes upside-down and things starts looking bad for the guy, who's always wanted to be a gangster...GOODFELLAS isn't just one of the definitive movies ever made, it makes its march brutally right on the spot, leaving everything that's been earlier made of mafia movies too old to stand up to it when it was released. It's challenger's are few; but there are two (maybe three if you set up the sequel) heavyweighters doing their thing too; THE GODFATHER and ONCE UPON A TIME IN America (last one also starring De Niro). Martin Scorsese had already showed the world that he was one of the most impressing director's to be in Hollywood at the time, and this settled his march once and for all as one of cinema history's biggest. Soon after this gangster installment Scorsese made another mob-movie with De Niro and Pesci, named CASINO, also a great achievement, but it can't stand against this. GOODFELLAS doesn't just have the perfect timing of drama, suspense, violence and pure Italian anger, the soundtrack playing fabulously along with great tracks as ""Gimme Shelter"", ""Stardust"", ""Bells Of St.Marys"" and ""Memo From Turner"". The actors are all amazing, and if I had to pick a favourite among the trio I had to say Liotta, although he didn't achieve an Oscar for his performance (Pesci did) his character simply fixes everything, going threw pissed-wife-happenings, drug-related-cases, killings and emotionally disturbance. The violence of the movie just let us see the real brutality inside mob business, Pesci striking a knife, De Niro kicking face, Liotta punching guy's face apart with a gun, Pesci sticking a knife into a guy's backhead...I mean, it's a pretty messed up brutal movie, and that simply sets the mood right. You know this is brutal business, it's illegal with capitol I, people get killed and business that's so freaking wrong for the law are done - and it's pure mafia. Seeing Ray Liotta stepping out of the car after he gets to know that the friendly-neighbourhood-(Spider is the bartender)man has been touching and offending his wife, is a sight simply making the hair rise. It reminds a bit off Caan in THE GODFATHER when he heads to kick his sister's husband's ass, well, I gotta say; Liotta isn't just three steps more violent, he is also three steps more calm and cool. GOODFELLAS is an amazing movie, and it really gives Coppola's 1972 mafia movie a real breather in the neck. STARS: 5/5"
479463,False,"This movie has everything.It has crime,a love story,drama,comedy everyone can enjoy it in a way or another.I love when a movie starts directly with the main character's backstory,this thing makes me to ""fell"" the movie better because I can empathize in a way with the character(Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job here).The movie action is pretty slow in comparison with the events(in my opinion) but this makes the movie even better because this ""slow action"" shows the way that gangsters are,they do crazy things but they are very calm when they do this.
The characters are memorable.
Acting is just too good.
Camera job even better.
Is a great movie.
Watch it."
479464,False,"Goodfellas (1990) is a major work of high cinema art. The best of the best in all ways! When the history of Western Art is written in the future, cinema will be included as a true and important art form along with painting and sculpture. Martin Scorcese will be ranked with his fellow artists of Italian descent, Michaelangelo and Leonardo DiVinci as one of the great artists of Western art history. Scorcese is a hero and a superstar in the world and history of art. No doubt about it.The Goodfellas (1990) movie is ranked as the #2 best gangster theme of all time by the American Film Institute (AFI), as one of the top 100 best films of all time by the same organization, and included on the USA Federal Government's Library Of Congress National Film Registry List of best USA movies every produced.The movie is about a 25 year span in the life of New York City born Henry Hill (Irish father, Italian mother, raised in 1940's and 1950's Queens, New York City) starting with his teen aged years in 1955 when he first joined an Italian organized crime group as a beginner errand boy for the mob, and continuing to 1980 when Henry Hill's 25 year history as a member of the Luchessi (NYC NY USA) crime family ended after Henry Hill agreed to become and FBI/ USA Federal Government prosecution witness against his fellow Luchessi crime family members (50 of whom were convicted and imprisoned as a result of Hienry Hill's 1980 turncoat testimony................Hill was then put into a Federal Government ""witness protection program"" from which he was evicted after the Goodfellas 1990 movie was released, and Hill got involved in mass media publicity activity connected with the movie which was based on his Wiseguy book (written by author Nicholas Pillagi) chraracter).The beautifully filmed and written movie appears to be a near documentary describing the crime world in New York City Henry Hill lived in and participated in until he was arrested for illegal drug activity in 1980, and ""flipped"" ........ he agreed to testify against his long time friends and fellow criminals..........to avoid certain long term incarceration).The statistics about this movie (reported in the WWW.IMDb.Com ""Trivia"" section of the IMDb.Com page devoted to Goodfellas 1990) are daunting.The ""F"" word was used during the film many hundreds of times, and held the record for the use of that famous but historically avoided word (in the movies) at the time the movie was released (the record was later broken, we are informed!).42 different songs were used to support the sound track of the movie.The Sopranos (1999 - 2006) series TV gangster theme program (voted the best written dramatic TV series in TV history by the Writers Guild Of America) is largely based on story telling and structural approach used in Goodfellas (1990). Goodfellas (1990) lead actress Lorainne Bracco also appeared in the Sopranos (1999 - 2006) TV series as Tony Soprano's lady psychiatrist.One of the minor actors in Goodfellas (1990) was a former New York City police officer whose father and other relatives had actually been in the Mafia. Eppolito wrote a best selling book about his life titled Mafia Cop, and was later convicted and jailed for murder and other crimes several years after the filming of Goodfellas (1990).The Goodfellas (1990) movie was based on a 1980's book titled Wiseguy written by Nicholas Pillagi (author of Serpico, also about New York City Italians involved in crime............husband of famous book and movie writer Nora Ephron). The book was based on extensive interviews with Henry Hill, and some editions of the Wiseguy (1986) book credited Henry Hill as the book author.A documentary titled The Real Goodfella (2006 UK) was produced about Henry Hill, and Hill himself appeared in the documentary which included his account of his part in the production of Goodfellas (1990).Hill died in 2012. He served time in prison during his 1955 - 1980 time as a Mafie associate criminal, and also again after he entered the Federal Government Witness Protection Program after he was arrested and convicted for drug crimes. He served a total of 14 years in prison. He was kicked out of the Witness Protection Program in 1991 as a result of his participation in Goodfellas (1990) movie publicity and his efforts to make himself a public celebrity made famous by that movie and the book Wiseguy. He survived another 21 years after leaving Federal Government protection until his 2012 death. He was paid more than half a million dollars for his part and contribution to the making of the Goodfellas (1990) movie. He lived and died in open prosperity and was never attacked or harmed by presumably vengeful former associates from the Mafia.Henry Hill's life after 1980 in the US Federal Government Witness Protection Program was presented and treated in comic form in a second movie about him titled My Blue Heaven (1991) written by Wisseguy author's book author and movie script writer wife of fame, Nora Ephron. Ephron wass famous for her comedy book writing (she wrote best seller Crazy Salad in the early 1970's) and comedy movie script writing (she wrote When Harry Met Sally 1988 starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan).The Goodfellas (1990) movie describes the famous Lufthansa Aircraft Heist of 1978, one of the largest robberies in USA history. That robbery was the subject of a movie titled The 10 Million Dollar Getaway, and included several cast members who acted in Goodfellas (1990).Goodfellas (1990) is by any measure an astonishing and worthy movie.It is a portrait of urban America in the mid-20th Century.Used copies of the movie can be purchased from Amazon.Com for tiny money (less than $5 as of 2017). This movie is worth study and re-screening often. It is a highwater mark of USA cinema.

479465,False,"GoodFellas is so good for so many reasons. The acting, directing and writing is flawless, not to mention the classic Scorsese soundtrack which only adds to the the picture's greatness. I've seen the film countless times and after every viewing I appreciate it that much more. It should go down as one of the best films ever made.  Scorsese has done it again!"
479466,False,"This movie is undoubtably one of my three favorite movies of all time. It is the best crime story to ever hit the silver screen. Maybe it's just an Italian thing DeNiro, Liotta, Pesci, Sorvino, and Bracco, perfect casting but no ones ever seemed to grasp the truth of the mafia like Scorsese. A must see for anyone! Simply a TEN."
479467,False,"Simply the best gangster movie ever made.Great story, great directing, great actors (especially Joe Pesci).Ray Liotta was outstanding and should have won an Oscar for his brilliant performance.De Niro is at his best also. If you liked The Godfather trilogy then you´ll love this one!!!"
479468,False,"As always Scorcese manages to make a very ""artistic"" movie unlike all other directors. Like in the later movie ""Casino"" he let the leading actors tell the story while the pictures roll on and it is first in the later part of the movie he revolves and take up the ""normal"" movie-style with dialogue. I think that this is a perfect way of making a movie interesting but perhaps it is getting a little too used by Scorcece, because all of the movies I have seen of him, not so many, is made this way. De Niro and Pesci shows how perfect they are at acting together in a ""Mafia-movie"" and this is one of the better they made together - Casino is still my favorite. I especially like the way Pesci is acting, he is just perfect at being a crazy killer that don't take no for an answer. So I hope to see more Scorcece movies starring De Niro and Pesci, but lets make it in an other - but still unusual way Scorcese."
479469,False,"Goodfellas is the best Mafia/gangster movie of all time, and one of the greatest movies ever. One of the greatest things about Goodfellas is the very wide range of emotions, moods, expressions, and atmosphere along with the very quick change between them. In a way the ending leaves you with a sort strange feeling, wondering 'should I be happy or sad?' In one way you even want to be a gangster because you see them laughing, happy, having fun and such a good time, but then suddenly it shows them killing or robbing the innocent, and then you don't really want to live like that. Sometimes even a mixture of the two settings to make you feel especially strange. It shows them both so well and at the same time that every person who sees the movie interprets it in a different way. Sometimes the mood they feel depends on the mood before the movie starts. I've heard many different ways people interpreted the movie's expressions and moods, but I always here one thing that's always the same; Goodfellas is one of the greatest movie's of all time."
479470,False,"All gangster movies will inevitably be compared to ""The Godfather"" series, but this one shines because it takes a daring, and hugely successful risk in not playing it for serious drama the whole way. It actually almost succeeds in making you ""like"" Henry Hill and his crew of Wiseguys. With the witty narration and comedic style, it's almost a fun comedy...and then, suddenly, savagely, it wrenches you back to reality as the plot takes a sinister, nasty turn.The classic scene in this picture has to be how Tommy (Joe Pesci) establishes the true maniacal menace of his character, without any *doubt*, and without any bloodshed. A lesser film would have shown you a few bloody examples of what Tommy is capable of as a sensational copout. The brinksmanship of the ""You think I'm funny?"" scene sells his character well before the trouble starts."
479471,False,"Excellent film. As compelling as the Godfather trilogy but Joe Pesci makes it a classic with his dark humour. The ""Funny"" sequence is one that can be watched again and again."
479472,False,"One of the best films I've ever seen. Outstanding performances by DeNiro, Pesci, and Liotta. Follows the book almost word for word. The best glimpse inside the mob that hollywood has ever offered us. It's a great movie, highly recommended"
479473,False,This movie works so well as an intriguing look into the world of the mob and is filled with many great performances and dialogue.  I think it's also worth pointing out that Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci worked so very well together here and they seemed to have a lot of fun making this movie. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to see a good gangster movie.
479474,False,"A movie must include everything to be an exelent movie, love, suspense, hate, sadness, friendship, laughs and much much more, what can i say.....this movie is so good that you´ll be shock, and you want to see it over and over again, you can´t belive ít´s true...it´s just too much ít´s a life work presented in 2,5 hours........and what a life.... i want to marie goodfellas.......this is the best film ever made"
479475,False,"I have to pick ""Goodfellas"" over ""The Godfather"" as my favorite crime movie of all time.  Tough it is a tough call, there is not a minute of boring or wasted film in ""Goodfellas"", whereas I think ""Godfather"" could make for a snappier movie with 10-15 minutes worth of cuts in various places.  This is a fascinating ride through the criminal life of a boy who started out a dreamer, and who made it to the big time.  Like ""The Decline & Fall of the Roman Empire,"" this masterful piece takes you through the life of a would-be gangster all the way to his disgraceful end as a government turnkey.  Ray Liotta delivers the performance of a lifetime as the main character, matched equally by Lorraine Bracco as his supportive yet fearful wife.  The fact that this movie is based on a true story only serves to pique interest further.  This is a must see for any movie-goer and deserves its place among the top 100 movies of all time."
479476,False,"intense mafia drama. that acts out in the vicious streets of pain.what we all know as modern day metropolis.its all about survival in the undergruond costra nostra structure.the raise and fall of average italian american.the question remains how far from reality is this poorly portraited, ugly acted, filthy dialoqe,outrageus barbaric movie.where are we know...."
479477,False,"What more can you ask for?  DeNiro, Pesci, three onions.  Not only can I watch this movie again and again, but it is also one of the most quotable movies of all time. ""Hoof""!"
479478,False,"This is one of the best mob flicks I've ever seen, Deniro, Pesci, and Liotta are the ultimate mob actors, this film was an excellent view of the true story of Henry Hill, The suspense in this flick was great. You never can trust anyone because ""Your murderers come with smiles."" Even though the ending is kind of known you still don't know whether to fear for this kid's life or what! ""You think this is funny?"""
479479,False,"I have never seen a film better or greater than Goodfellas. The performances are virtuoso, and this is Scorsese at is possible greatest. I own this film because it is absolutely brilliant. It was a close run between it and my number 2 movie, The Godfather. I believe, though, that Goodfellas is arguably the greatest gangster film ever made, and the fact that Dances With Wolves won the Academy Awards for Best Picture is unforgivable. Goodfellas is my number 1 movie."
479480,False,"Now that the '90s have passed it can be said.  This is the best movie of the decade.  Also, now that the 1900's are ""gone"" (and there was nothing we could do about it), it can be said - top 5 of all time! The way the movie captures the lifestyle is perfect. This movie has 2 of the most memorable scenes (Shinebox, Funny How)ever."
479481,False,"Forget anything you 've seen.  Along with the ""Godfather"" part 1, this is the film to watch. I have seen it 100's of times.  De Niro and Pesci give an outstanding performance, along with Paul Sorvino.  It doesn't get much better than that."
479482,False,"I've watched Goodfellas at least 15 times and each time I'm entertained and this is why.  The performances by all actors are superb.  Even if you're not an organized crime genre fanatic, but like stories with struggle, success and corruption, then check it out.The narrative style of story telling gives you the feeling you're a voyeur watching (as all film audiences do) with a sense that you're getting away with something.  The first half is a story of young Henry's development from boy to young man and it's quite a fun trip.  As a young man, he achieves a level of success within the organization he is a `member' of and has a lot o fun in the process.  Then things get out of hand and there is a price for all the wrong doings of the past.The last section's pace of the movie is awesome.  You get the feeling your spinning out of control with Henry and Karen during a Sunday where there is a lot of `errands' to get done while the Feds watch.  Paranoia is validated.Scorsese's films do that to you.  They make you feel what's going on with the characters in the story."
479483,False,"This movie, to me, is what mafia life was all about.  It didn't over-dramatize anything.  The language, the ruthlessness, the lack of trust; this was a great film.  I especially liked the aspect of how that the main character was taken from being a young boy through his life into the present.  I liked the aspect of how that they were close knit.  To me, it was kinda like a little anthropology study of a strange type of community.I would recommend this movie to anyone that is interested in what life in the mafia is truly like.  It may seem graphic, but that is what makes it good.  There is no sugarcoating.  On the other hand, they don't dramatize it to the point of losing its luster either.  It is a 10."
479484,False,"For so long ""The Godfather"" and its superior sequel ""The Godfather: Part II"" were held up as the ultimate gangster movies.  There had been imitators, yet none could match the originality and sheer weight of the Corleone saga.If anyone were to recreate the mafia genre, or at least redefine it, it would have to be someone with the right cultural baggage.  Martin Scorsese had already painted an indelible vision of New York through ""Mean Streets"", ""Taxi Driver"" and to a lesser extent, ""Raging Bull.""  In that sense, he was the perfect choice to direct a modern version of a genre that inspires, fears and captures the imagination of audiences on a similar level to science fiction.Instead of rehashing the past of ""The Godfather"", Scorsese drew from a more recent past: the 1960's and 70's.  In fact Scorsese drew most inspiration from a book by journalist Nicholas Pileggi, entitled 'Wiseguy'.  After both men made contact with one another they set about creating a script for a film based upon the book.The premise for the film is based around the true story of a 1980's court case involving an informant for a New York mafia family.  Henry Hill (Christopher Serrone) is a 13-year old boy growing up in 1950's Brooklyn. Awestruck by his daily mafia surroundings, Henry is drawn to the allure of a gangster's life.  While his father, of Irish stock, works away in a blue-collar life of drudgery, Henry sees the mafia as a way out to a life of glamour, girls, money and ultimately, respect.He begins his journey as an errand boy for local crime boss Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino), collecting debts and doing damage when required.  As Henry says in the narration, ""I was earning more money at 14 than most of the adults in the neighbourhood.""  Absolutely and utterly enamoured with his new life, Henry is proud to be a mobster.At this stage of the film, we feel as if we are in Corleone territory. Everything is nostalgic to the point of rose-tintedness, we as an audience are drawn to what the mafia represents: a tough guy fraternity that deals above the law.  Henry's ascension into the mafia life is something we view with a smile rather than a frown.By the 1960's we catch up with the adult Henry (Ray Liotta).  Now 21 years old, he and his friend and cohort Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci) are foot soldiers for boss Cicero.  Robbing trucks for cigarettes, clothing and alcohol, the two forge a name for themselves as good earners.  Despite their accomplishments, they pale in comparison the 'made' guys, the real Mafioso who run Cicero's shady underworld.Scorsese introduces us to the Cicero family in a superb steadicam sequence early on in the film.  As Henry walks through a nightclub we are shown the caricatures of mafia hitmen.  He narrates over the top and presents us characters with names like Fat Andy, Frankie the Wop, Jimmy No Nose, Pete the Killer and Jimmy Two Times.  If one were to be not paying attention, you could be mistaken that you were watching ""Dick Tracy"".One character not caricatured at all is Jimmy Conway, played by the great Robert De Niro.  Cool, calm, tough and quietly evil, Conway is the ultimate gangster, bristling with venom and style.  Due to his Irish background, Conway will never be made, yet his presence is enough to suggest that his standing on the ladder is a non-issue.  De Niro plays Conway brilliantly, drawing from his portrayl of Jake La Motta in ""Raging Bull"".  Once again, the tag team combination of Scorsese and De Niro just about makes the film, despite the overall excellence of the movie.Henry climbs higher and higher up the ladder of the mafia, marrying a Jewish girl named Karen (Lorraine Bracco) along the way and forging a name for himself as a gangster who's 'got things worked out'.  He's earning big and the Cicero family is doing nicely.  It all goes pear-shaped when Henry's goals change: he acquires a mistress and begins dealing cocaine.  As his lavish tastes and dangerous lifestyle escalate, the workings of the Cicero family also begin to change.  The 1970's introduce new, more violent and extravagant opportunities to make money for Henry, Tommy and Jimmy, all of which start the rot.  It all begins to tumble down and Henry and Karen are forced to make decisions that could cost them dearly in the long run.
""Goodfellas"" is blessed with outstanding performances all round.  Liotta's Henry is understated, yet we travel along his journey of self-destruction easily.  Like Henry himself, we are too caught up in the speed and glamour of the life to take stock of where he ends up.  Pesci is amazing as the volatile yet charismatic Tommy.  He won an Oscar for his role (and repeated this performance in 1995's ""Casino"") and it's obvious why.  The sense of unease mixed with humour around Tommy is a credit to Pesci's ability to invisibly and unassumingly flick the switch between joker and psychopath. Bracco is also strong as Karen.  She has since taken up a more subdued role on the television series ""The Sopranos""; also based on the mafia.  Also of note are Chuck Low as Morrie, Frank Vincent as Billy Bats and the late Catherine Scorsese as Tommy's mother.Scorsese's collaborators Michael Ballhaus (cinematography) and Thelma Schoonmaker (editing) once again deliver.  Ballhaus captures the mood of each decade perfectly: the nostalgia and innocence of the 1950's, the power of the 1960's and the seedy 1970's, they are all captured brilliantly. Also of note is the final few scenes involving a coked-up Henry trying to do a million things at once.  The frenetic pace and quick editing of this section is a credit to both Ballhaus and Schoonmaker.The director is in total control of proceedings, with the film never altering from its course.  The use of music is superlative, the costumes and overall mise en scene of the film is pure genius.  Scorsese hasn't matched ""Goodfellas"" since, and while ""Taxi Driver"" remains his best, ""Goodfellas"" ranks extremely close.By the end of the film the viewer realises that they have witnessed a different kind of gangster movie.  Brutal, fast, exciting and violent, ""Goodfellas"" is the anti-""Godfather"".  It portrays the mafia life as an uncompromising and shady world, yet one that rewards those who play by its rules.  It is a difficult feat for the greatest of directors to create a movie that engrains itself on popular culture, but Scorsese once again delivers.  ""Goodfellas"" is the best modern gangster movie and ranks alongside ""The Godfather"" as the best of the mobster genre."
479485,False,"Great use of voice-over narration from Ray Liotta's character. Fluid scene transitions and fantastic placement of carefully picked songs accent the ""mise en scene"" in each scene. This character driven film is delightful to watch, especially the opening and closing montages. Martin Scorsese is a master of film and everyone should get a glimpse of the amazing chemistry between DiNero and Scorsese."
479486,False,"This one is absolute one of my favourite. The acting performances of De Niro and Pesci are excellent as well as the description of the real mob live during 1950-1980. The murder scenes are put very well together.They are brutal as hell.If you like Scarface, Casino, Godfather or Resevoir Dogs the this one is for you.
Rating: 10/10"
479487,False,"This is the best mob film ever.  Scorsese's directing is on top just as are Deniro's and Liotta's performances.  Joe Pesci plays the perfect psycopath and Deniro as usual gives a great performance as  he does in every other Scorsese film.  New generation, old tradition, that's exactly what this movie is all about. In the old tradition a wise guy would never kill a made guy, in the new tradition, a wise guy does kill a made guy but he can't get away with it.
Does the Godfather deserve to be in the same category as Goodfellas?  ""I say Yes.""  There are three reason's why I think this is true.  1. The directing in both movies captures the reality of mob life and how their lives end.  2. The acting in both movies is superlative 3. The two movies depict the same subject but with  different stories. I have to admit I think Goodfellas is much better than Godfather because the murder scenes in  The Godfather are too stylish and too made up. Goodfellas on the other hand is based on a true story and the violent scenes look real and you get that feel of reality in those scenes because it really did happen.  I'm not about to say Martin Scorsese is a better director than Coppola, but I feel that Scorsese's film Goodfellas has more emotion than Coppola's film Godfather. Remember that scene in Goodfellas when Deniro, Liotta, and Pesci are beating the life out of that made guy in the bar and you hear the music getting louder? That's what Scorsese does with his films. He uses music to enhance emotion in his movie's. Coppola does not do that, no music, no feeling, just a scene and a person.  Some people may not like the ending of Goodfellas. To tell you the truth, I didn't like the ending at first, but I saw it five more times and I like it now. I know the ending doesn't give us a reason not to be a gangster, but Scorsese didn't want this film to have a sad ending like Blow. He wanted to make this film funny and crazy because that's the way Nicholas Pileggi's mob life was, funny and crazy. Scorsese did this film his way, the Martin Scorsese way.  I recommend this movie to anyone who is a Scorsese fan.  I give it a 10 out of 10."
479488,False,"Scorsese is a genius.With Goodfellas, he demonstrates his full command of the medium. He uses every technique at his disposal to tell his story. He uses the camera like an artist uses a paint brush. With the use of voice over narration,freeze frame, long tracking shots,flawless editing and popular music to accentuate the atmosphere of each scene,he creates a masterpiece.He gets great performances from all his actors with an outstanding performance by Joe Pesci. Scorsese does a fabulous job of creating the feel of urgency and paranoia in the final segment. I don't think there is another director on the planet that could have translated the source material onto the screen as effectively as Scorsese has. A superb film in every respect."
479489,False,"If I had my way, this is the film that all gangster & violence films should be measured up against. It sets all the standards which some films have since lived up to but most have failed miserably.Dare I say it, it's better than Godfather 1 & probably even part 2, and that takes some doing.The main reason, is the plot is kept simple, there's just the right amount of characters. Even Godfather 1 -if you can find a fault with it- probably has just one or two extra Italians to confuse you slightly.This is gangster films & even films generally, at it's best.Sure there's some gruesome & heartless scenes, and I felt for the innocent postman, but they fit in perfectly with the context of the film and create exactly the mood.Of course, the main reason is that it's based on true accounts which you can easily believe. If only others in the film industry would try to do likewise.9.5/10 if such a vote existed, it doesn't so 10/10. Alongside only Star Wars, Great Escape, Shawshank Redemption & the Magnificent 7 out of 300 films. That's pretty good company."
479490,False,"The only thing keeping this movie from being known as Scorsese's crowning achievement is that other movie he made known as ""Raging Bull"".I have read many times how ""Raging Bull"" was the greatest movie of the 80's. That's probably true. This is possibly the greatest movie of the 90's (definitely in the top 3).The thing that makes this movie so attractive to me is that Scorsese didn't set out to make another ""Godfather"". This isn't about Mafia Kings, or Crime Lords. This is about the lower level of people who are the ""soldiers"". These are the people who are several levels down from Don Corleone. Hence, the tone of the movie is much more raw, and violent.Scorsese pays attention to every little detail in this movie. He uses so many different aspects of cinema in order to turn what may be a typical scene into something that you always remember. Examples of this include the brilliant camera work through the back entrance of the nightclub ; freeze frames that are accompanied with interesting narrative ; great shifts in scenes that highlight twists in the characters' minds. It is as though Scorsese had a whole bag of tricks that he was picking from to put into this movie - and they all work perfectly. The soundtrack is implemented brilliantly. In some cases it places an exclamation point on a dramatic scene (when the opening chords of Cream's ""Sunshine Of Your Love"" play as the camera centers on James Conway you know something bad is going to be happening soon). In other cases it is used to give the viewer a sense of a time period (50's, 60's, 70's etc). Scorsese even shows the same scene twice from two different angles just to illustrate two different points of view...brilliant !I could go on forever about this movie...but that would be ridiculous. The best way to illustrate just how brilliant Scorsese is, is to point out that this isn't even considered his best movie by many !!!!!"
479491,False,"Martin Scorsese has made some of the most enduring American films of the last 30 years, and Goodfellas still stands one of his very best. Arguably the best film of the 90's,Goodfellas delivers laughs, thrills, shocks, and a great soundtrack of pop music ranging three decades. As with any Scorsese film, the acting is top-notch, especially from Liotta and Academy Award winner Pesci. And as with any Scorsese film, there's brutal violence abound. Goodfellas is definitely one of the best gangster films ever, and it's also a vivid look into an era that once was. On top of all that, it's my all-time favorite film. You can't ask for anything else from a movie than what Scorsese's masterpiece delivers. 10/10"
479492,False,"Although many people will disagree and claim this status for ""The Godfather"", I believe that ""Goodfellas"" is the best gangster movie ever made. Unflinchingly realistic, this film is not content to simply glamorize the criminal lifestyle but also shows what violent sociopaths choose to live it. More important, it shows the downfall and bad end that most such people can expect to eventually come to. If nothing else the sheer number of imitators this movie has spawned should be a testimony to it's brilliance. A must see, no two ways about it."
479493,False,"Before  I had seen this film in 1992 the best film I had ever seen was the Breakfast club which isn't bad but this introduced me to whole new world that I have yet to come out of .From the opening scene to the end credits everything else in my life including my exams were forgotten about, Robert De Niro is outstanding as is Joe Pesci but Ray Liotta gives a performance so immense that it is unlikely he will ever emerge from its shadow .Martin Scorcese gives a directing master class as I would go out on a limb to say visually this is the most stylish film you will ever see I will not continue to go on and there are no more words that I could put down that could possibly do this film the justice it rightly deserves."
479494,False,"The words ""best of all time"" and ""greatest ever"" get lobbied about far too frequently, but in the case of Goodfellas, it is no exaggeration. Goodfellas is the best gangster movie ever, surpassing other gems such as Mean Streets and Casino (mediocre compared to Goodfellas). No need to say anything more, you've all seen it. And if by chance you haven't, what are you waiting for?"
479495,False,This in my opinion is the best film ever made and anyone who has not seen it should drop what they are doing right now and head down to the video store and rent it! IT is an amazing piece of work. Everything from the direction by Scorsese and the acting by the three leads is perfect.
479496,False,Maybe the best. Certainly the most original movie ever released about mafia. Also the soundtrack is wonderful.
479497,False,"Take one of the best directors cinema has ever produced, add arguably the greatest actor, mix in with a carear defining lead performance, season heavily with a comedy/violent mix previously unheralded with a Pesci sauce, garnish with a sexy clump of Bracco.  For full flavour sprinkle in a supporting cast with strong flavour- particularly vital is the Sorvino berry and serve up a mouth watering feast of family, friends, crime, violence, comedy, pathos and a pinch of being pinched.  N.B. Flavour is heightened significantly garnished by a soundtrack which brings out the rich flavour of all the ingredients."
479498,False,"This film is truly superb. Everything from the acting to the direction flows smoothly. Liotta lets us into the world of Henry Hill and we all get a glimpse of the good times and the bad times of being a hood. Each character manages to slot perfectly into the individual roles and the all star cast adds that extra bit of magic to this wonderful Scorsese picture.  Accompanying Liotta's character are De Niro and Pesci and once again they show us, just how well they can act. From start to finish, each scene fits together and captivates the audience. You will either love the characters or hate them, but the film will do nothing but impress.  If you haven't seen this film, you are missing out on a truly classic movie."
479499,False,"This is a flawless movie. Not a damn thing wrong with it. It's awfully hard for me to pick a favorite movie but if I had to, this one would be up there battling for the top spot. Martin Scorsese again proves to all doubters that he is the master. When it comes to making an urban saga, you can't top Scorsese. It's futile to even try. From the first frame of the movie, you're sucked in and vacum sealed until the credits are over. Everything is top notch. Joe Pesci gives one of the most memorable performances in screen history. He takes what could have been a cliched, one dimensional character and gives him life. Underneath all his boasts and jokes you can see a truly insane man waiting for something to set him off. It's scary just to watch him on the screen. You think he's gonna step out and smack you around. It's a damn shame that he hasn't made a movie since Leathal Weapon 4. This movie was so good that Scorsese practically remade it with Casino. To watch a master at work and see the best film of the 90's, watch Goodfellas."
479500,False,"What a movie. I always used to write off gangster movies as being the same as each other and boring. This film is amazing. I couldn't stop thinking about it after...and to think that it was based on a true story...Jimmy, Henry etc.. are still out there somewhere...!"
479501,False,"This three-act morality play that glorifies a refugee who escaped the ""Mob Culture"" is appealing for many reasons and unappealing for many more!  As a star-making vehicle for Ray Liotta, it succeeds on the basis of his and Lorraine Bracco's nuanced portrayals.  GOODFELLAS should really have been named WISE GUYS but ran into name or prior copyright (?) confusion, I believe.         Following along many of the same heavily beaten paths of the two worthy GODFATHER movies of the 1970's, in GOODFELLAS, the Mob ""wise guys"" are amoral, capitalistic hedonists who try to succeed and attain the ""American dream.""  A much better movie made last year (TRAFFIC, directed by Steven Soderbergh) uncovered the sordid venality of drug pushers whose hypocritical ""family values"" are truly a sham.           In the GOODFELLAS storyline, the not-very-creatively scripted characters and their unmemorable dialogue receive highlighting and benefits by the director's quite creative and memorable use of pop music and camera tricks galore.  However, as the typical first-time viewer walks away from the end credits, one asks oneself: ""Did the justice system really win? Do bottom-dwelling psychopaths really get their comeuppance? and Are the plusses of such a frank movie more than the minuses (racial-ethnic stereotyping and epithets overflowing and rampant)?""            I suppose this crowd-pleaser is a landmark ""thrilling"" part of the Best American Movies of the Twentieth Century. Still, I found GOODFELLAS to be as offensive as PULP FICTION when it lowers its sights to scenes of mayhem and violence, gore and bloodsport.  But then again, Academy voters picked GLADIATOR as the Best Picture of 2000, as well."
479502,False,"Quite possibly the best mob movie ever, ""Goodfellas"" delivers to the mind the most permanent and lasting impressions than any movie I've ever seen. Martin Scorsese, unbelieveably, outdoes himself again, with the help of some of the industry's best actors.  Although Ray Liotta is the figure-point of the film, Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro steal the show.  Now, don't get me wrong...Liotta puts out a solid performance.  But the acting of Pesci and De Niro is what keeps this movie in your VCR.  The mix of Scorsese and De Niro once again proves to the people that ""practice makes perfect.""  If you want to know what I'm talking about, check out the scene in the bar where the camera zooms in on De Niro, with ""Sunshine of Your Love"" in the background. Wow."
479503,False,this has got to be one of my favorite movies of all time.  Let's start by saying Martin Scorcese is awesome.  This has got to be one of the most entertaining and interesting movies of all time.  All 3 actors are excellent and it's a shame that Ray Liotta wasn't nominated for an oscar in this movie.  Joe Pesci is perfect as Tommy the crazy ass lunatic mobster and is well deserved of the oscar he was awarded.  Robert De Niro shows us again why he is one of the greatest actors of all time.  Ray Liotta shines in this movie as Henry Hill and I could not have picked another actor to play the part.  The cast and screenplay compliment each other perfectly.  The movie is impeccable and helps to bring to life an already amazing book (Wise Guy by Nicholas Pileggi)
479504,False,"I love this movie. I think this is the ultimate gangster movie. The acting is absolutely fantastic. Pesci, Liotta, and DeNiro all pull in great performances. I think this movie will live to be one of the classic movies of all time. Pesci won Best Supporting Actor for this movie, and it's very well-deserved. He stole the show with his crazy, cowboy-like character, Tommy. His cussing and killing is so convincing, it makes Pesci look like the type of guy that would really blow a guy's head off in real life. Liotta showed that he has the talent to lead a movie, and do it sucessfully. DeNiro shows once again why he is considered to be one of the greatest actors of all time. Lorraine Bracco is very good as Karen Hill. I think the camerawork is spectacular providing great shots from all angles. This movie shows everyone what gangster movies are supposed to be like. I give it an A++++++++++++"
479505,False,"After years of pondering the question, I have concluded that this is my favorite film of all time.  It has an extremely compelling narrative, strong acting performances, and wonderful cinematography.  The film depicts years in the lives of Italian Americans in the mafia, and like a delicious Italian meal, the film is rich with variety and depth of the characters that appear on the screen.  You'll find yourself moved to a wide range of emotions while watching this film.  Ray Liotta is very convincing as Henry Hill.  Pesci's somewhat over-the-top performance brilliantly fits within the story Scorcese is telling."
479506,False,"Good fellas was directed by master director Martin Scorcese and is probabaly his best.  It tells the story of an Irish-Italian protaginist, Henry Hill, who starts out running errands for his friendly mafia neighbours to becoming a made man.  It brings us through the traditional and exciting avenues of an Italian crime syndicate from the the fifties to the eighties. The cast is also exceptional.  Ray Liotta plays the main character and his close friend and mentor is played by Robert DeNiro, the definitive actor to play a gangster.  The rest of the cast is filled with actors who play mafiosos in many other crime movies.  The movie is really a story told in the first person by the main character, Henry Hill, of the perks of being involved in the mafia and the sudden betrayl and the self-centeredness that the mob can entail.    It's truly a great picture that should be seen by everybody whoo has any interest in crime or crime dramas.  Superb!"
479507,False,"What a film!  You have the trinity of Scorsese, DeNiro, and Pesci at top form.  Ray Liotta is a favorite who deserves more of these kinds of roles. Lorraine Bracco is divine--esp. in the ""you stood me up"" scene.  Then, there is Catherine Scorsese, Martin Scorsese's mother, who ad libbed her part. She was a natural--absolute perfection.  I love DeNiro and Paul Sorvino. And I always wonder what is Joe Pesci like in real life!  Note the ""how am I funny scene.""  Funny how to the trinity they are Bobby, Marty, and Joey--something tells me that is not the case with us mere mortals. SUPERB."
479508,False,"I live in Emeryville, California (near SF, CA, which is more well known than Emeryville), and one of my favorite ways to spend a couple of hours is to head over to Everett&Jones for Ribs and watch Goodfellas. From the beginning, it draws you in to the mafia life following Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) rise from childhood dreams of being a gangster along with Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro), and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci in an amazing role). From the beginning, Scorsese captures the romance and logic of being a gangster. Young Henry Hill saw the beauty of it all. ""It was out of respect"" he says, when kids carried his mother's groceries all the way home for her. ""It was better than being president"", he says. And why not? Gangsters seemed immune to police, law, having to pay bills. That's the beauty that draws you in. Pesci plays the role of a hot-tempered gangster which is Robin Hood on-target. You can tell early on that this is a man who probably got stepped on when younger, and craved the respect given to gangsters. That makes him the most volatile of the trio since he constantly wants the respect from everyone, but sometimes doesn't command it. DeNiro is, not surprisingly, great as Jimmy Conway, but between the central role that Liotta has and the character Pesci plays, DeNiro's character doesn't really stand out. That's not to say DeNiro didn't play the character well, just that the nature of his character, IMO, wasn't meant to stick out.The music is a wonderful complement to the story. The fluid camera shots are amazing, especially after multiple viewings. There's one in particular where it follows Henry and Karen on their first real date. It's amazing. There's also another scene where the piano exit of Layla plays in the background. It's one of my favorites in the movie.Geez, what else can be said. Great acting by everyone. The story flows like water. The characters are drawn perfectly and have a depth. You feel the rationale of these gangsters and even find yourself siding with them. No scene is wasted.This is easily a 10/10, and to some extent, makes me rethink some other movies that I've rated a 9 or 10. Taking from Spinal Tap, this movie should be an 11. It is on my top 5 list of favorite movies. I liked it more than The Godfather (it's close, though). I've seen it a dozen times and it loses nothing with each subsequent viewing. If anything, it gains more and more of my admiration."
479509,False,"The acting, the directing and the final piece is film making at its best. The highest accolade i can give this film is that it if The Godfather trilogy was not made this would not only be the best crime  film ever made but also the best film made bar none."
479510,False,"Goodfellas is one of those movies that you can't help to enjoy. From the classic opening sequence in the car to the freeze-frame snapshots, there is something about it that instantly makes you want to root for the bad guys. After reading the book, I knew that I just had to see the film and having watched it many times, can't count the number of wonderful scenes that I now know nearly by heart. Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci play brilliant characters who have just the slightest psychotic tendencies to them, and Robert DeNiro is excellent as the almost fatherly figure for them. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes good movies. Film of the Nineties."
479511,False,"Everything about this film is brilliant. The film moves at a fast pace and as a result remains entertaining and utterly compelling throughout. The rock and pop soundtrack which is evident throughout most of the film keeps the pace up, as does Scorcese's energetic direction. Theperformances (by De niro and Pesci in particular) are stunning, makingeven the most violent characters strangely appealing. If you haven't seen this film then you are missing out the greatest gangster film ever made and one that you will want to see again and again."
479512,False,"Goodfellas is one of those films that gets better every time you watch it. The story has been well documented, but what works for me is the superb soundtrack that accompanies most scenes, the incredible and intense acting, the amazing script, the clothes and the fact that the story is fast moving - there are no long drawn out scenes.  Robert De Niro must go down as one of the all time greats - he can steal a scene without actually saying a word. I could go on for years about this film - as it has been a big part of my life.  For all of you that have yet to watch Goodfellas - go and buy it now."
479513,False,"I'm going to cut to the chase:  If you like movies, if you really like crime movies, and if you want an awesome movie... See this.  I mostly rent, but this is one of the few movies I went out of my way to purchase.  Watching this is amazing.  You root for the bad guys, since the main characters are ""bad guys"".  You see the difficulties they encounter, and the decisions they make.  This is perfect.  Thank you for this movie..."
479514,False,"Nothing is comparable to the epic of Martin Scorcese. This movie was a landmark for true crime flicks. Of course The Godfather is a masterpiece but it's not a mob movie like Goodfellas. The direction, the music, the actors... everything is just perfect. The freeze frame sequence are stunning just like the raw violence and dialogue played by De Niro and Pesci."
479515,False,"I was shocked to see that Goodfellas lost to Dances with the Wolves for best picture. I am not saying that that movie was bad but i am saying Goodfellas is a thousand times better than that movie.  All actors are in top form, Liotta quite possibly gives the best performance of his life, Deniro is just Deniro and Joe Pesci yea well he got an oscar for it so i can't say anything else.  The movie revolves around 3 best friends (Liotta, Deniro and Pesci) who work their way up in the mafia crime organization, thats not just it, it has liotta's (Henry Hill) personal life involved too, we see steady character changes and developments as the movie goes on.  The movie is flawless. I give it 10/10."
479516,False,"Goodfellas may be one of the best films I've had the pleasure to sit and enjoy in a movie theatre.  I've seen a lot of films, whether on home video or in theatre's, but this may be the best.  I remember sitting mesmerized for two hours and twenty minutes in a packed movie theatre in Buffalo, NY, not wanting Scorsese's epic to end.  I truly believe this is the film his early classic's were leading up to.  Goodfellas is a compilation in spirit of Mean Streets, Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, combining elements from all and the truly fascinating story of Henry Hill into Scorsese best film.  It works on every level.  The story, acting, cinematography and editing are equally brilliant. In this busy day and age when its tough to manage the time to watch the newest movie on video or in theatres I can still find time to watch Goodfellas almost anytime."
479517,False,"I caught this terrific movie on TV again last night and, not for the first time, thought how wonderfully riveting this brilliantly directed and sublimely acted film is.  The dialogue never appears to hit a false note; the situations are frequently, sickeningly engrossing and the ensemble playing is as natural as breathing.  Yet it was whilst enjoying this latter part that I realised a potential flaw in this otherwise flawless gem: It dawned on me that - of the evil triumvirate at the heart of this film (Pesci [frighteningly superb]; De Niro and Liotta) - only Henry Hill (Liotta) is given the scope by writer and director to show any humanity throughout several of the story's more callous moments.  Is this because he was the only gangster with any humanity at the time of the Goodfellas?  (Possibly). Or is it perhaps because the film is based directly on his testimony (in which case - he would allow himself be occassionaly human in a world of unfeeling animals: wouldn't he?)?  Call me cynical, but watch for yourself. 
Anyway.  That's the only potential flaw.  That and the fact that, three quarters of the way in - as Liotta focusses on drug running - Scorsese decides to produce twenty minutes of a completely different style of movie! Oh, and Lorraine Bracco's bravura performance being shamefully underrated by far too many reviewers (which is, of course, not a flaw of the film!).  And finally the fact that, even though this film has existed for over a decade (and therefore the evidence that fine writing helps fine direction and fine direction helps fine acting and - NEVER! - these things altogether add up to classic cinema) Hollywood will still, on the whole, prefer to go for chaos over character and Janet and John dialogue over a literate script!  (One for the Brit's there!)"
479518,False,"The best director and the best actor ever in the best movie they have made together.  Great performances all around, especially Pesci and De Niro. Great direction, screenplay, cinematography.  I can find no flaw in this masterpiece."
479519,False,"I can never get tired of watching this film. Robert Dinero, and Joe Pesci are great.  What I do not understand is why Ray Liota's career did not take off better.  He does a great job as Henry Hill, and he has not been in anything exciting in a long time.  The way that this movie shows the mob and how it works is great.  A must see!"
479520,False,"""Goodfellas"" is a perfect film. You have it all. Brilliant, acting, directing & writing. How this film didn't beat out ""Dances With Wolves"" for Best Picture is the 8th mystery of the world. The sudden violence is brutal yet so poetic. But there is one big mistake people make about this film. In the Robert DeNiro video collection, you get ""Mean Streets,"" ""Raging Bull"" & ""Goodfellas."" That's wrong. That's saying ""Goodfellas"" (like many other people say) is DeNiro's movie. But, it's not (""Taxi Driver"" should've been the 3rd flick in the set). ""Goodfellas"" is the director's film (If you don't who it is, you should be ashamed) & Henry Hill's film. Ray L. give his career performance. I must say that after watching this and comparing it to his other works. His career has been a waste. Liotta should have walked away with an Oscar for his performance of Henry Hill. He was beyond perfect. But the greatest thing here is how Scorsese made this oh so violent story into one of, if not the greatest dark comedy, ever. 10 out of 10."
479521,False,"I believe that Goodfellas is Martin Scorsese's greatest film. This movie is a film fan's dream come true. The acting is brillant. Ray Liotta is terrific as Henry Hill and Robert De Niro is great as Jimmy The Saint. Joe Pesci deserved his Oscar for a brillant and terrifying performance. Scorsese is the greatest film-maker of his generation and he has made alot of great films. Goodfellas tops them all. The way the camera moves, the way the narration grabs you and pulls you in and the characters themselves, top notch film-making at it's best. I loved this movie from the first minute to the last. I especially loved the ending where Liotta is running around doing his errands and snorting cocaine the whole time. Scorsese injects into his film style the paranoia that Liotta's character is feeling. In the process making our heart race at the same time. This is a great film and it is highly recommended."
479522,False,"This is one of the greatest gangster movies I have ever seen, and it's right up there next to The Godfather (parts 1 and 2 obviously). Great acting by the whole cast, especially Joe Pesci. Definitely Scorcese's best, although Mean Streets is a close second."
479523,False,"This speed, fluency, and general style of this film make it seem to last one hour rather than three. The one shot scene when Henry enters the club with his date via the kitchen is quite simply breathtaking. Another thing, has anyone noticed the amount of scenes that involve food? It is unwise to watch this film while hungry."
479524,False,"I've just re-watched Goodfellas for about the 100th time and it was as fresh as the first time I saw it. The characters are so well drawn and the actors so well suited that it really feels like you know these people. This is helped by the camera work which is exceptional especially the steadicam shot into the club, which I have not seen surpassed since. Coming from rural England, as I do, I don't know whether this film is a true picture of life in the mob but if it isn't, it should be. 10 out of 10"
479525,False,"Watching this movie for the umpteenth time I realized that Martin Scorsese made a flawless movie.  I could not, and my friends could not find one film flub, one boring scene, one improbable line of dialogue or action.On top of all this, look at the camera work.  Notice the scene in The Copacabana where Henry Hill introduces us to his mob buddies.  Notice how the camera doesn't cut away and how we are able to get a glimpse of each character and have an understanding of who they are and what their importance is.  Also, look at the famous shot in which the camera follows Henry and Karen from their car all the way to their table.  It is almost four minutes long!!!The camera work again comes into play in a more subtle manner in certain scenes of the movie.  Notice how the camera is sped up during the events of May 11, 1980.  Every single scene, including the kitchen scene, are given a sense of urgency due to this camera work.Finally, I am proud to have noticed that Bobby Vinton's ""Roses are Red"" plays four times during Henry and Karen's romancing including one ""live"" performance.This is the perfect movie.  A captivating story, an energetic soundtrack, fancy camera work."
479526,False,"Scorsese is unquestionably our greatest contemporary filmmaker. No one, with the exception perhaps of Kubrick, can match his scope, depth, technical expertise, or sheer consistency. GoodFellas shows Scorsese at his best. The story is riveting, the performances; extraordinary, and the ending, although not a surprise, packs an enormous punch. What distinguishes it from the other great gangster films (Hawks' Scarface [and DePalma's],  Coppola's Godfather I & II ) is not its  themes, but rather their depiction. Never before has a film so thoroughly captured the JOY, danger, and ultimately, the desperation of  ""Family"" life. One of the world's great films."
479527,False,i loved this confrontational movie about gangsters... i'm not a huge fan of mafia films but this is definitely a fantastic example of how a film can totally surprise me...
479528,False,"This movie is the highlight of everyone involved's careers, as far as I'm concerned. Wonderful, masterful work. You don't even notice how long a film it is while watching it, as it's perfectly paced and edited. Ray Liotta is underrated in his role, should've been an Oscar contender. This film is the rightful Best Picture of the Decade."
479529,False,"""GoodFellas"" is one of my favorite films, I have seen this movie countless times and it gets better each time. Martin Scorsese is arguably the best director working in films today and yet he has been ignored by the Oscars countless times. Scorsese was at the top of his craft when he made this film, and it shows. The cast in this movie is amazing. Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco all turn in top notch performances. Movies don't get much better than this. Don't miss it."
479530,False,"This movie is a stunning cinematic achievement. At the core is Ray Liotta, who should have been at least nominated for an Academy Award. You can visibly see his transformation from a young, energetic gangster to an older, paranoid man constantly on the run. Complimenting his performance is the beautiful Lorraine Bracco, one of the most underrated actresses working today, who turns in a stellar (also Oscar-worthy) turn as his mob wife. The rest of the cast is superb, most notably Joe Pesci who shines in his Oscar-winning role. Scorsese picked nothing but the best when it came to casting. The entire movie is backed by classic music which adapts to each decade we're watching, starting in the 30's and 40's and ending up in the 80's. The wedding, family dinners, jail scenes and the infamous nightclub are nothing but genuine. I truly believe this movie should have received more credit, awards and merit. I was also happy to see that Robert DeNiro did not have a huge part in this movie. As I respect him as being one of the greatest actors in recent times, Scorsese was wise in shifting attention of Liotta. It is not to say that DeNiro had a small part, but it seemed that he was in a supporting role, contrary to other gangster movies he has starred in, like ""Casino"" where he is the main character.The best scene? Without a doubt, the 3 minutes when Liotta and Bracco enter the Copacabana Nightclub through a sub-level entrance. As they wander through the halls and corridors of the kitchen and waiting areas, viewers get a first hand look at behind the scenes of a classic nightclub, all set to ""The He Kissed Me"" by The Crystals.This is a fine piece of work Scorsese has created, and I strongly recommend seeing it."
479531,False,"Actor Robert DeNiro and director Martin Scorsese are among the very best in their respective fields. They have been a very successful team on such classic films as Raging Bull, Mean Streets, Casino and Cape Fear. Goodfellas is the very best film they've made together. It is the best mob movie ever made and probably the best of the 1990's. Goodfellas is about as good as a movie can be. The story, the acting, directing, the music used all blend together perfectly. Ray Liotta, a terrific and underappreciated actor, plays Henry Hill, who gets involved as a kid with the local mobsters in his neighborhood. It is based on a true story told in Nick Pilleggi's book ""Wiseguy"". Joe Pesci won an Oscar for his supporting role. The cast also includes such stars as DeNiro, Paul Sorvino and Lorraine Bracco as Henry's wife. There are alot of classic movie moments, including a hilarious scene with Catherine Scorsese as Pesci's mother. Goodfellas is an awesome movie. When it's over, you don't feel like you've sat there for 2 and a half hours. It's the kind of movie you can watch repeatedly and never get bored. This movie easily gets a ""10"" on my scale."
479532,False,"I thought that Goodfellas was one of the  best movies that I've ever seen, and to be more specific, Joe Pesci and Robert DiNero, and seeing how Joe won best supporting actor, it wasnt just me who thought it was good."
479533,False,"If I was asked to pick the all time best gangster movie this would definitely be my answer. Martin Scorsesse is the man. Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Ray Liota do a great job as Italian gangsters. Every moment of this movie is complete unrealness.Drugs, Guns, all the violence you want in a top quality flick, and a whole lot of the F word."
479534,False,"Martin Scorsese pulls you into the world of Henry Hill so effortlessly, you don't even realize that nearly two and a half hours have gone by.  Henry Hill gives us first person narration in his rise through the ranks of the mob.  He goes from being a small time hood, to a major player. Along the way, we meet his partners in crime: Jimmy Conway and Tommy DeVitto.  These two are played with finesse and bombast by Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci.  We get glimpses into the lives of wiseguys.  They have money, power and girls.  But underneath the glossy surface, there's always the treat of violence that could erupt at any time.  An off the cuff remark from Henry sends Tommy into a rant that borderlines a catastrophe.  Scorsese pulls no punches in delivering the violence that fills the lives of these people.  Life in the mob is not a glamorous life, it's filled with threats, violence, and paranoia.  One of the best sequences in the film is toward the end where Henry starts out his day at 6:55 AM and it gets worse from there. Scorsese pulls you into Henry's frantic world by the voiceover, and pretty soon, you're concerned about the dinner that Henry is planning.  Goodfellas is one of the best films ever made about life in the mob.  It shows the highs and the lows, and the danger that lays in each."
479535,False,"Goodfellas		A/B-				3.25.00		2.35:1/5.1 	Previously Viewed	Non Anamorphic WidescreenThis is a great movie, and not just a great mob movie.  The story is quick and smart, and the all star cast does a great job with it.  Scorsese uses a grainy film stock (intentionally I'm sure) bothers me.  Whatever his reasons, for me it distracts from the experience.  Additionally, the video transfer is not anamorphic: a double disappointment.  The DVD includes few real extras."
479536,False,"Goodfellas is an amazing film and should be watched by absolutely anyone. It is the best modern gangster film to date with the director (Martin Scorsese) and a superb cast(Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci.) The story line is incredible and the acting is superb. Only one thing left to say.WATCH IT!!!"
479537,False,"In his usual slick cinematic style, Scorcese brings to the screen this blistering account of the inner workings of the gangster underworld. Featuring memorable performances by de Niro as well as Pesci, the highlight for any movie freak must be the two and a half minutes (+) steadicam shot that will blow your mind away; it is sensationally smooth and a pure joy to watch. Highly Recommended!"
479538,False,"I was all set to write a nice review of this film, but nothing I could say here would do it justice.  It's a great film with an Oscar performance from Joe Pesci.  Ray Liotta is excellent.  Robert DeNiro is excellent.  Lorraine Bracco is excellent.  Just see it and take my word for it.  This gangster film at its best."
479539,False,"I really can't believe people can't like this movie. Because GoodFellas is simply a documentary about criminal life is: no good characters, no happy feelings but just horrible acts: so it's REAL world !!! Yes: if you want to see a fantasy movie, look at Matrix !!! But don't tell me, people, that it's better than GoodFellas."
479540,False,"this is one of the best movies Joe Pesci has ever been in.  It shows that a movie can be funny and disturbing at the same time.  I was ****ed when Henry ratted at the end, though.  A must see for fans of De Niro, Pesci, and Scorsese"
479541,False,"Martin Scorcese has been one of the most important film makers of all time, and while he has made more thoughtful and introspective films than Goodfellas, he has never made a better or more enjoyable one.  Goodfellas is a wonderfully full and well acted film about life in the mob.  Unlike the Godfather, it doesn't romanticize the mob, but gives us insight into the details of its life.  It also shows us one man's decent into drug addiction and violence.  The film is long, but uses every second to give us a fuller picture of Henry Hill's life.  Ray Liotta is wonderful as Henry Hill, a man who only slowly realizes he has gotten way over his head.  Joe Pesci's performance is rightfully considered a classic, and DeNiro gives us what he always gives us-  this time in a supporting role.  Goodfellas knows the rhythm and beat about living in the mob, and while The Godfather gives us the melody, Goodfellas gives us its equally important counterpart."
479542,False,"Henry Hill small town gangsters errand boy who makes it big. Great film plenty of blood and guts and full of great wit, love the bit about the wife who turns a blind eye when things are good then can't understand when things go wrong. The film is frantic and fast moving and you are never board. I suggest you watch and find out for yourself just how good it is. Not just another gangster film."
479543,False,"Ray Liotta makes dominates this film. Another (I'm using this word again) BRILLIANT film about life in the Mafia. This, Casino, and all The Godfathers are essential viewings. Once again, everyone in the cast is perfect, especially Joe Pesci (he is hilarious in his role as Tommy), Liotta and I especially enjoyed Lorraine Bracco's performance as Karen, Henry's long-suffering wife. She puts up with so much from him. Scorsese is also one of my favorite directors, and this is his best film. 4 stars, since I can't give it 5. Pure genius."
479544,False,"Most critics seem to think Scorsese will be remembered for Raging Bull.   I disagree.   THis is pure cinema.  Scorsese works the entire movie like a master, using freeze frames, slow motion, stunning steadicam work, and other techniques in a way that adds meaning to the work.   From start to finish, this film is the opposite side of an equally wonderful film, The Godfather. It shows us the unvarnished reality of the mob, the petty arguments, the likable psychos, and general absurdities of a life of crime.   The movie never stops moving and is one of the few movies I've ever seen that left me in awe at the end.    This one was robbed of an Oscar. Time will show that this is the one people remember from the 1990s.   My 3rd favorite film of all time behind Godfather I & II."
479545,False,"As Howard Stern says, ""There's not a thing wrong with this film."" One scene melts into the next, obscuring its length. It blows by, and before you know it, it's over. The acting, directing and cinematography are all superior. In measure of the acting quality, DeNiro doesn't even give the most memorable performance. The film is wonderfully constructed. I love the middle-is-beginning motif. The movie has some of the funniest, most powerful, most memorable scenes in film history. In short, this film blows you away."
479546,False,"Scorsese is undoubtedly the leader in that select group of American directors, including Kubrick, Welles, Spielberg (and one day Tarantino), that never miss with a movie. While the 70's and 80's saw him construct masterpieces with effortless ease, his passage into the 90's came from 'Goodfellas', a film that can easily match 'Taxi Driver', 'Raging Bull' and 'King Of Comedy' for intensity and technique.The film charts mafia exploits through three generations. Tremendous acting from Scorsese-favourite DeNiro, short-fused Pesci, and Ray Liotta allow some of the most memorable scenes in modern cinema. The steadycam shot following Liotta into the club, and the seamless ""funny like a clown..."" confrontation between Pesci and Liotta are movie classics. Combine a great music score, lashings of atmosphere, unsentimental direction and the most vivid look at mob life to date, and 'Goodfellas' can truly be called the masterpiece of the nineties."
479547,False,"Outstanding script, dialog,  soundtrack,  screenplay,  directing, editing, and of course top caliber outstanding performances by every single person who appeared in this motion picture.  Perhaps the best movie of the 90's Martin Scorsese  pitches a perfect game with this masterpiece."
479548,False,"""Goodfellas"" is a masterpiece of moviemaking, combining a taut script, outstanding direction and a perfect cast to pull the viewer into the life of the mob. Based on the true story of Henry Hill (the excellent Ray Liotta), the movie exudes realism, often unsettling, never boring. Nothing is glossed over. The violence, language, criminal behavior and fear is presented without any protective coating.There are no heroes in this film. We aren't asked to accept the characters, only see them for what they are. Joe Pesci, in a well-deserved Oscar-winning role, is equaled by Robert DeNiro, Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino and Liotta.No doubt one of the best movies ever made."
479549,False,"Machavelli would have been proud of GoodFellas. No characters are glorified or given unreal motives for their actions. This movie is not driven by fantasy or great one-liners, yet it is totally engrossing. The violence is sickening but motivated. These men are ruthless, they are not characters in a movie jockeying for attention. They are pure Machavelli, what is expedient is necessarily right. In this life, if it is more convenient to have you dead... watch your back and never trust your friends especially if they are smiling.This is the real Mafia; life at its most dangerous. A complex game where everything is for sale and anyone is expendable. Whatever works is right. Machavelli himself couldn't have a better movie demonstrating his theories."
479550,False,"I've seen this film many times over and it never fails to amaze me how people can criticize Ray Liotta's performance. Liotta's character is pivotal to the overall plot. Because he does not live up to a stereotype of a gangster, people deem his performance as flat and uninteresting. Remember, Liotta's character says ""I always wanted to be a gangster"" not ""I was born to be a gangster"". Over the course of the film, you can see Liotta's character slowly dislike the life he wanted to be so much apart of. The fact that Liotta's character is only half Italian only highlights this point. Other scenes like when Henry sees Jimmy and Tommy after the death of Stacks and when all three are at Tommy's Mother's House further show Henry's remorse for his life decisions. And at the very end of the film when he's commenting on how he missed the old times, he seems to be happy. As the Sid Vicious music starts and we see Henry going back into his house, he does so with a smile, even when he slams the door and we here the slam of the ""cell doors"". Henry is content with the life he has, even if it means he has to remain anonymous for the rest of his life. Liotta's performance as Henry Hill is one of the most subtle and restrained performances I've seen in recent memory. Its a pity that people have to listen to the comments of critics to form their own opinions. People should see the movie and form their own opinions first before running to the newspaper stand and reading the what the critics say. Let's be a little bit more independent in our thought and less dogmatic."
479551,False,"Unlike other movies Goodfellas is just not a very good movie. The story line didn't make any sense and so did the characters, like really whose called Tommy Devito, Danny Devitos brother? I've honestly watched this movie long and hard and realized that this movie isn't all that funny either. Comedy movies should be funny and this movie just didn't cut it. I highly recommend that if your at the video store anytime soon and your picking a movie do not pick this one because it is fake, unfunny and lame. Joe Pesci was boring and looked old and had absolutely no screen presence. I watch lots of movies and i now know that this is a movie that shouldn't and must not be watched by any living human being who has a brain. Robert De Niro looks fat and uninteresting. Ray Liotta looks like a store robbing punk and Pesci and looks like some fat old guy who bring me my paper in the morning. My favorite part of the movie was when it was over. This has got to be on my top 10 worst movies. That guy from See Spot Run was in the movie but he just played some boring overweight guy who i didn't care for. The guns looked like something you could buy from the $2 shop and the blood looked like tomato sauce. George Lucas should have directed this movie, unlike this movie his Star Wars series especially the last 3 (the most recent) were examples of his directing excellence which made him billions of dollars. All the other people below me are fan boys of De Niro and ignore all the bad things about the movie. thank you for reading, ciao"
479552,False,"IMDb Top 250: 15 Goodfellas is one of the best films ever. It's dramatic, charming, crazy and even a bit funny. Chronicling the rise and fall of wiseguy Henry Hill from the 50's to the 80's, Goodfellas is the best look at mob life... after the Godfather. This is Scorcese's best work that I have seen.The plot can be summarized very easily: Henry Hill wants to be a gangster, and when he becomes one he lives the life, good and bad. A biography like this could be shown in an average way, but it has the Scorcese touch. The presentation of Goodfellas is, in my opinion the most interesting and engaging in film. Period music plays throughout, Hill and Karen narrate with charm, and the pacing is perfect. Goodfellas doesn't have a dull moment.The characters are top-notch cinema, interesting and flawed. Hill, our anti-hero, is a charming Irish-Italian nobody who becomes a somebody. He looks cool, talks cool, and acts cool, until he gets in over his head with products and problems. Jimmy Conwa is the high roller, stuffing everyone's pockets with money, playing it cool until his neck is on the line. And Tommy, dear volatile Tommy, whose voice and actions steal the show, is an Italian fireball who is unpredictable. All expertly acted, these are the guys you wish you could be. Karen is also well-acted, from innocence to involvement. The entire cast of Goodfellas are personalities.This film has its share of incredible cinematic moments. From the pistol-whipping to the montage of deaths, every scene is crafted with care. Two in particular have stood above the rest though: the famous ""How am I funny?"" speech, a highlight of the rapid-fire dialogue, and the long shoot, showing Henry and Karen's date from a single perspective. Genius directing.The mood is wonderful, helped profusely by the music. Starting with oldies to show the golden age of gangsters, the music progresses in the same direction as the plot. It's unbelievable. When you hear songs from the movie, you think of Goodfellas. I hated 'Sunshine of Your Love' until Goodfellas, and when I hear it now I think of Jimmy Conway, smoking his cigarette, thinking, as the camera slowly zooms in.A classic, Goodfellas has inspired countless films even to this day. Every part of this crime masterpiece is top- notch. If you like movies, you have to see this. 9.7/10"
479553,False,"this movie is unbelievable. Scorsese is an unbelievable director he makes every shot is unique and the performances by Joe pesci, ray liotta and Robert De Niro are all amazing. especially Joe pesci. Scorsese is great, i mean it was amazing how in some scenes he can use the music to show what people are thinking. this is the greatest film of all time and i have a hard time finding people who've even heard of it. it's so under-appreciated that i want to just force everyone in the world to watch it. this movie is so over-whelming. the first time i saw it i couldn't take it all in and i didn't think much of it. but the second time i was like holy ****."
479554,False,"Gangster movies are always popular; they combine the quick action of the Wild West with a certain degree of politeness and courtesy that makes the whole world seem intriguingly different to anything else you've seen. And it makes for reasonable cinema; but it's not the film many people make it out to be. It's enjoyable, and it probably will hold your attention. The fact that it's based on a true story, too, adds a little quality to it that makes it intriguing. But the character development is limited; only De Niro's character really seems to move during the film, and in that way, reality loses out to cinema fiction here. As a documentary, I think something like this would have been very fascinating. As a film, though, it seems to be lacking something somewhere down the line.When all's said and done, it's a decent and enjoyable film, but there are plenty of better films out there. It's worth a watch, sure. It has some good performances, from an impressive cast - De Niro's performance is as good as you might hope or expect from him - and the film's ending is certainly memorable. But at the end, it feels a little stretched at 2 1/2 hours, and it falls short of being spectacular."
479555,False,"Goodfellas is an overrated gangster movie, kind of like the Godfather except it's better. The movie might be overrated but I still like it. The story is interesting, especially since it's true although I'm sure it's been quite fictionalized to make a good movie. The acting in the movie is good especially by Joe Pesci. He's a funny guy. So see this movie. bye."
479556,False,"Goodfellas is about a journey of an outsider who makes it good in the world of Italian mafia, and befriends two mobs for the remainder of his career. Much like Forrest Gump, its a story being told largely through one person' point of view. I conclude at the end that although the movie was exteremely enjoyable, its a bit overrated and it did not bear any lasting images in my psyche. There isn't a single aspect that strikes me as memorable or powerful. Thus it irritates me to no end that Goodfellas is constantly being compared to The Godfather, because I couldn't disagree more. What makes The Godfather so good is that its not really about gangsters running a business, but a deep look on family relationships and how their respective roles and personalities contribute to the family's successes and downfall. Goodfellas is only about three men working together, having the time of their lives, and occasionally punching and kicking their way through obstacles before things starts to fall apart at the end - nothing is out of the ordinary. The only message I get from the story is that becoming a gangster gives you power, but you must pay for that power dearly in exchange for absolute loyalty. Problem is, I've heard of this countless of times already.Goodfellas has a great cast (especially Pesci), nicely paced storyline and unfortunately an average soundtrack trying hard to ""capture"" the feel of the period. I like it and its really entertaining, but at the same time its an utterly forgettable gangster movie."
479557,False,"I found this movie quite annoying, mainly due to the Tommy DeVito character acting so stupid. I couldn't believe a criminal organisation wouldn't have been caught before they did, with such a moron in it who would shoot a bar boy in the foot just for not being quick enough with the coffee. If that character hadn't been in it, I'm sure I would have been a lot more believable.I know that there are people like that in the world, but there's no way they would get away with much if people acted that stupid and obvious.It had a good message about how it's better to not get involved with those types and didn't glamorise it as with the Godfather films. Maybe it wasn't such a bad idea to show them as a bunch of clowns, but I still found it a little annoying at times as to how stupid they acted."
479558,False,"""As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster.""Every single time we had to do the pointless and awkward introduction in my undergrad classes, Henry Hill's opening monologue was always my response. This achieved a couple goals for me, I avoided having to actually articulate the fact that I wanted to run for office, and I also got to see if there were any hidden cinephiles scattered around me. It never really worked; occasionally I would find another fan of the film, but never someone with a broad film taste who didn't suggest we watch Scarface as a double feature with Goodfellas. Martin Scorsese, one of the Kings of New York settled on adapting the novel by Nicholas Pileggi following the life of Henry Hill as he rose to prominence in the Brooklyn mafia. Starring Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci, Goodfellas is the work of a true auteur in top form and has remained a mafia classic 27 years after its release. Growing up in a modest home with blue collar parents, Henry Hill saw a way to make everything he had ever wanted his. Henry saw how the ""wiseguys' in his neighborhood lived, and wanted to be like them and have the freedom to go anywhere they wanted while wearing the best clothes and constantly having hundred dollar bills to flash. Henry started small as a child then a teenager, along with his friend Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) advancing in the mafia with each passing year. Learning the ins and outs, the rules and orders, the intricate details of the mafia--like only one could see from the inside, Henry had no problem paying his dues and earning his place. When Henry is really initiated and deemed worthy of meeting the higher ranks, he is introduced to Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro). Conway, Hill, and DeVito become something of a dream team executing some of the biggest robberies and hijackings the country had ever seen. Henry's life comes crashing down when he's ""pinched"" and must take the fall for a crime. While in jail, Hill enters the drug trade making more money at less of a split than he ever had before. After his jail sentence is complete, mob boss Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino) assures Henry that he will be fine in the mafia once again. He understood that Henry had to deal in drugs to keep himself and his family afloat while in prison, but he has to give that up as Paulie isn't involved in the drug trade. Living better than he ever had before, however, meant that Hill had no intentions of leaving the drug trade behind. Staying involved in drugs and becoming an addict himself got Hill into a world of trouble and the only way he can get out is by bringing about the downfall of the two people closest to him, the two he had spent nearly his whole life with, Jimmy and Tommy.In an expert maneuver, Martin Scorsese begins in the middle of the story, then traces to the beginning through the end. The story structure of Goodfellas is one to marvel at, and certainly one that wouldn't have been so flawlessly executed without director Martin Scorsese. Goodfellas is so engaging that I can't tell you how many times I've seen it, and yet, if I walk into a room in which it is playing I will watch until the end. From the perfect execution of the introductory scenes, which are often a rather boring part in other films, to the brilliant in-depth character development, Goodfellas is a film to study for its narrative. An astute viewer is given such a complete glimpse into the men's lives that one can see where the character's failings exist that will eventually bring them down. Some of the best tracking shots in cinema history are contained within Goodfellas. The one fans of the film love to discuss are the scene in which Henry and his eventual wife are shown across the street as their car is getting parked and followed by the camera all the way in through the kitchen then through the front of the restaurant. It's a beautiful shot lasting two full minutes, and that's just one example of directorial prowess concerning tracking shots. My personal favorite occurs during the scene in which the audience is introduced to the mafia members. The camera slides down the length of the bar as we learn the names of those in the Brooklyn mafia as well as certain character traits they possess. One of my favorite parts of the film is the way its narration changes seamlessly between Henry and Karen Hill. We go from hearing Henry's voice then his wife's, then back to Henry's voice again all the while changing the point of view but the audience never misses a step and the narrative is never sloppy. Put simply, Goodfellas is a master class in filmmaking from a director who is no stranger to making classic films. Goodfellas on its own would be enough for any director to hang their hat on, but the fact that the same director was also behind Raging Bull and Taxi Driver speaks to the greatness of Martin Scorsese. I'll never get over what happened to Tommy, though."
479559,False,"GoodFellas deserves its reputation as one of the best gangster films, and also one of the most realistic: some critics have called it a version of The Godfather without the romanticizing of the gangsters. Based on the actual autobiography of a minor player in the gang hierarchy, the film is one of Martin Scorsese's best, with several sequences of what critics have rightly called bravura film making. As expected from Scorsese, lots of language, some sex and drugs, and intense, shocking violence. But if you want a film like this, this is one you will want. In some ways the film is a trial run for the even longer and more ambitious Scorsese film Casino, which makes it interesting to see both films; personally I prefer the grittier Goodfellas. I saw it on the very good Warner Home Video Blu-Ray."
479560,False,"Goodfellas is Crime drama that came out almost 25 years ago and it still stands as by far the best mob movie ever made.The film is about of the true story of former gangster Henry Hill, who worked his up the ranks to become a big time gangster in New York in the 1960's. The film focuses on Hill working his way from a child gangster to becoming a popular gangster in the mob. The story flows very well and without any noticeable bumps in the movie. The story is easy to follow and not very confusing. The film just focuses on the ride of Henry Hill as a New York gangster, however no film is perfect, my only critique or criticism with the film is that at some point for a couple of minutes it seemed like the film dragged on with the plot. However, I barely noticed it, so it isn't that big of a deal. Henry Hill is a bad guy, but at the same time you can't help but just feel for him. In a world where gangsters spend their time murdering and stealing, Hill seems like the one who has a heart, even if it is hard to see.The acting is as good as I thought it would be. Henry Hill is played Ray Liotta, and he does a really good job of portraying the young gangster, but he was overshadowed by supporting cast. Robert De Niro does a amazing job playing the veteran gangster who lives in a world surrounded by guns, money, sex and violence. He made me hate him and feel for him at many different points in the film. He carried the film nicely and kept me interested. Tommy DeVito is played by Joe Pesci and he has never been better. This is one of his best performances as a violent and humorous psycho who will make jokes and then start shooting people around him. He made me think that there is no way that anyone this crazy exists, but at the same time, he was my favorite character throughout the film. Joe Pesci fits the role perfectly. The rest of the cast is also delivers but with De Niro and Pesci performances I didn't care that much about the other performances. Goodfellas had 12 different songs, playing at 12 different points and all of the music flowed together very well. I don't think the score could've been better fit for the tone and atmosphere of the movie. During tense situations or heart pounding moments the music is always there to build the atmosphere, and make the scene in the movie seem meaningful even when it doesn't matter that much. The score just works so well with the movie and makes moments that already stand out even more intense. Few movies have the ability to create a feeling to the viewer and then double that feeling with the music that is playing. The screenplay and the script is also very well done. Martin Scorsese does a great job of showing the life of Henry Hill using convincing dialogue and scenes. I loved the way events played out. It seems like the events were played out in a real life scenario. Also this movie has some of my favorite quotes and scenes I have ever seen in a movie. Nothing in this movie is predictable or cliché at any point of the film. Whenever something important happened it wasn't predictable, and at some points of the film, I was caught off guard completely. The dialogue also made every scene seem meaningful even when it didn't affect the plot of the film or change the characters in a major or dramatic way. When a scene was full of suspense, the dialogue made all of it full of anticipation and gripped me in a very memorizing way. I may be talking about the dialogue a lot, but it did help the film a lot by building the situations and making every scene have deeper meaning. The dialogue was my favorite part of the film.The overall theme is forgiveness and if the main character can live with himself with all of the brutal things he does to other people. I couldn't think of a better way to show this theme by taking the true story of a gangster and bringing back to life. With great acting, a well made script, convincing dialogue, an amazing atmosphere and compelling story make Goodfellas one of the best movies of all time. If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend you do, this is the best mob movie ever made."
479561,False,"There is really nothing bad at all that I can say about this film. The acting is great, the special FX are great, and the story is great. This film was based on Henry Hill, a mobster that lived the life since he was a teenager. He did great, all up until he took a wrong turn and did something that the mob highly frowned upon. The film has wonderful camera shots, great back story, and a film that I study as a student. This is a must watch film, and something that I think you can watch over and over again. You feel for each character in the movie, and can't help but wonder what it was like to live in the glory days of mob life."
479562,False,"Goodfellas is my favorite movie. Out of all movies I've ever seen, I've re-watched this one the most. I just love it. The characters, the acting, the scenes, the lines, the music, the food! Every time I watch this movie it makes me wanna make pasta and red sauce - and grill up some peppers and onions! - I saw this movie long before I knew or cared who Scorsese was. I'm not a huge fan of his films - some I like more than others - but this one, this one really sticks. I can re-watch it and never get bored. So many favorite scenes. So watchable. And the music - some of my favorite scenes are done with such attention to incorporating the music and music queues - it's incredible! - I've since read the book(s) - which I highly recommend. - This is more of a gushing diatribe than a movie review; let me break it down. This movie was made before CGI overtook your screen. It's a very real-feeling true story of a boy who grew up and became heavily involved with the mob. It's the story of Henry Hill. It's well made, it's well told, Ray Liotta is utterly amazing here, and if you have not seen it, I urge you to do so. It's amazing!"
479563,False,"When I was younger I couldn't decide which one of these classics is the best film about gangsters ever made. The Godfather or Goodfellas. As I grow up, though I acknowledge the Godfather to be a masterpiece, Goodfellas is definitely my favorite one. I can't find a flaw in this film no matter how hard I try. The story is powerful, exciting, emotional and thrilling. All that without being complicated and without having to remember 100 character's names and situations. The direction by Scorsese is excellent. I can't say much about it, none other than that it's one his best films. I love the narration, I love the acting, I love the film's music. It's one of those films that I loved every minute watching it, have watched it 10 times but never got bored by it. If you love gangster films you probably have watched too, if not, go watch it now!"
479564,False,"Which makes Martin Scorsese one of the best movie directors in the world. Many may argue which Scorsese movie is the best (for me it will always be TD).I have always loved the crime genre, and the drama, both of does makes excellent crime drama - which is in my opinion the best movie genre ever because I love it so much. This movie takes that genre into a much, much more gritty and dark direction which I haven't quite seen. You talk about Godfather, it may be dark in many aspects, but nowhere is it as close as Goodfellas when it comes to grittiness. This movie tells the biographical life of former mobster Henry Hill during his life from the later 50's into the early 1980's, in such a great fashion from brilliant movie director Martin Scorsese. I feel as if Henry Hill has a radical transformation, and how his life as a mobster changes so fast. Ray Liotta gives a breath taking performance. And what can I say about Bob De Niro that hasn't already been said, he is always great and this movie is one of his later success in his career before he went goodbye as an amazing actor. Joe Pesci? He is such a brilliant actor, and this movie showed his brilliance in acting so much. With this, all I can say about Goodfellas is this - ''As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster.''"
479565,False,"If there is a movie with ""goodfellas"" like De Niro and Pesci directed by Scorsese then you shouldn't miss out. This with the Godfather movie were two best gangster movies of all times and they both are based on Sicilian-Americans. The iconic Italinan-kind-of-narrative-screenplay does the trick for Scorsese again. The characters Jimmy, Henry,Tommy and Paulie are memorable and defined perfectly by the director. Joe Pesci was the best among in this movie as he is funny and short-tempered at the same time and no wonder academy recognized his performance. The script was like a double-edged sword that made this movie so memorable."
479566,False,"The GoodfellasOne of the most amazing criminal movies about gangsters.Criminal life has always been like in this also in other parts of the world . In the 90s in Russia people were killed for saying a bad word.This we can also see in the Goodfellas, when Tommy was insulted by his old friend. Tommy used to work for him as a cleaner.It was so easy to lose your life.Judges, police, politicians, security guards - everyone belonged to a criminal circle. Corruption was everywhere.One could rob and then kill easily.It was easy to lose life. Gangsters didn't care about stupid jobs. They didn't know what it was to pay bills.The Goodfellas shows us the criminal life in those times. It was a great time,people could do anything, but this time changed after drugs were released on the market. In America you could get 20 years in prison for selling drugs. Nobody wanted it.The ending impressed me so much.Robert De Niro and Joe Pesco played their roles so perfect like in Casino movie. One of the best gangster movies I have seen."
479567,False,"I have seen Goodfellas too many times to count. If you have not seen this masterpiece you MUST. 1. Amazing direction. 2. Amazing Camera work and visuals. 3. Amazing performances all around!!!! 4. Great story and well written.As an indie film-maker, I learn something new every time. As a movie lover, the emotional impact brings me into the gangster world every time. The story is strong.I gotta get back to work, so I will tell you this: Whether or not you like gangster films or not, if you do love cinema, you will respect and enjoy this superb film. ~Antonio"
479568,False,"Ever since The Godfather first premiered way back in 1972, I find it quite the challenge to call any subsequent gangster film a great one. Not only do such films need to have a really gripping and remarkable story. these films should be orchestrated by a director who has enough knowledge of this crime sub-genre and is able to deftly juggle all of the filmmaking elements to create a truly fascinating motion picture. Goodfellas is such a film. It is a movie that I have a deep affection for. An affection that only increases after every viewing. Goodfellas is one of the best films you will ever see. It is a rich and expansive motion picture that grabs your attention from the very first scene and never lets go. There have been so many films since The Godfather that have tried, and failed, to give us another gangster movie to remember. A few have succeeded, with Goodfellas being one of them. With the distinguished acting talents of Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci, along with the masterful direction of Martin Scorsese, this is a really unique gangster film. Whenever I am about to watch Goodfellas, I always get the feeling that I am on the verge of experiencing something grand and exquisite, a characteristic of any great film. Simply put, Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is an enduring classic for the ages. I'm gonna give THE GOODFELLAS a 10\10 stars."
479569,False,"There was a time in my youth when I really didn't appreciate gangster movies. Maybe it was because of the way I was raised or the amount of estrogen present in my mothers womb due to birth order but I never saw the intense violence of that lifestyle as anything but a cry for help. It wasn't until watching Martin Scorsese's The Departed (2006) that my notions of true- to-life crime dramas began to change. I then went back to watch Goodfellas (1990), a film I originally saw bits and pieces of when I was twelve.Today Goodfellas remains to me a revelation. An honest portrayal of the Mafioso lifestyle told directly from the horses mouth.The movie itself takes the viewer through three decades of mob life. Our protagonist Henry becomes enamored with the lifestyle in early adolescence and is hooked with its excesses before costars Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci even appear on screen. Once they do, the trio become the focus of the film as they attempt to climb up the Lucchese family hierarchy. Ray Liotta serves as our narrator and double for real-life wiseguy Henry Hill a half Irish-Italian mobster turned informant who spilled the beans on the Lucchese crime family for the FBI and later writer Nicholas Pileggi. Pileggi would later release his book Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family in 1986 which is around the time director Martin Scorsese got wind of the story.The film is told through a series of episodes starting with the three protagonists driving in darkness and killing an unknown man in the trunk of their car. The film then linearly progresses through time, revisiting that gruesome scene halfway through. While the story structure diverges slightly from the traditionally linear, anticipating action, climax, resolution format, the movie keeps interest. This is to the credit of Martin Scorsese's direction as well as his habit of putting bubbly 50's and 60's pop songs over brutal acts of violence. Nicholas Pileggi should also take a bow both for the original book and countless rewrites that made Goodfellas possible. It was his authenticity that brought the characters dimension.but while the writer gives characters motivations and plot, it is the actors that really make them flesh and blood. Robert De Niro's Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway towers in every scene he's in with equal parts suavity and malice. While De Niro provides the group credibility in the yes of the mob and audience, Joe Pesci is pure id. A trigger-happy sociopath with a red hot temper and a gun; not a combination that leads to good things in a movie of this kind. Pesci would end up winning an Oscar for his work on Goodfellas; a role that was originally offered to Al Pacino.One underrated aspect of Goodfellas is the character arch of Lorraine Bracco's role Karen Hill; Henry's wife. There are moments of the film narrated by the tragic heroine that provide the movie with a sense of perspective just as Henry's objectivity has gone off the deep end. She's an outsider who is at first overwhelmed but becomes seduced by the decadence of mob life and breaks bad. I would argue that the river runs deeper with Karen than with the dejected Henry. Henry wants the fancy cars, excessive Staten Island home and the most expensive artificial Christmas tree money can buy. But when Karen is handed a gun and told to hide it, right after a aberrant neighbor gets his faced smashed with the butt-end, she claims arousal. This is not a woman who craves simple security in the arms of the hero, she wants respect. That's why every transgression Henry or anyone makes is met with hostility. What isn't shown in the movie but detailed in the book was Karen's affair with mob capo Paul Vario while Henry was in prison; little more Lady MacBeth than Ophelia if you ask me.Of course, Goodfellas as a whole is studded with set pieces of violence and cruelty that in a lesser movie I wouldn't be impressed with. But as with good food, its not just ingredients that make the meal, its how its presented. The violence of Goodfellas is presented with a matter- of-factness and purpose that isn't gratuitous. Scorsese doesn't want you to bask in the glory of outright gore, he wants you to experience the world as the characters do, a task which he largely succeeds in.I love this movie if for no other reason than it breaks the mold and sets a gold-standard for other genre movies to inspire to. It features topnotch performances from actors and actresses at the top of their game, and it showcases the uncompromising vision and talent of one of the greatest auteurs of the late 20th century.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"
479570,False,"I'm sorry Godfather 1 and 2, but this movie is better, in my opinion.It really is a tough choice to make, since all three movies are perfect in my opinion, but I just like this one the most.If you have never seen this, why not? You're missing out. Robert De Nero and Joe Pesci are at their absolute best in this. When I recommend a movie to someone that has either of those guys, THIS is the movie I always say first.However, it should be noted that a performance in this that people underrate is Ray Liotta's. He's fantastic as Henry Hill and he is way more interesting than the real life Henry Hill (who has been accused to have lied about and embellished his mafia stories).Martin Scorsese has never done a better movie than this.So if you haven't seen this, THEN GO SEE IT!"
479571,False,"Goodfellas was a great movie and one of the most popular gangster movies of all time. Being that its based on a true story, it shows the ups and downs of life in the Italian mafia. The film makes great use of cinematography such as with the camera work. The musical selection also goes well with the corresponding scenes. The director, Martin Scorsese, use great directing techniques to get the best out of his actors and actresses. The character development is is also set up really well taking you through the best of times in the mafia and the worst of times. The script probably stands out the most, being that the movie was based off of a book. So all the stories are true and all his fellow gangsters were actually based off of real life characters. The acting might have been some of the best that I had seen in a gangster film with Ray Liotta playing the main character perfectly but the actor whose role stood out the most was Joe Pesci. He even went on to win an Oscar for best supporting actor for that role. There were few objections to the movie but many people felt that the language used was too vulgar. I think it just better help explain just the type of lifestyle that these guys were living. Some also believed that the movie should have received an NC-17 rating but it was barely able to squeak by with a R rating. Being a huge fan of the film I would definitely have to recommend it to whoever likes gangster genres."
479572,False,"No one actually realizes how immaculately this film has been made. It is a masterclass in time and emotion. A lot, in fact too many, people are complaining about it being very violent, too bad! it is based on the life of a real gangster in the real world what did you expect? As a matter of fact; the real story actually makes this a kid's movie.Ray Liotta: performs with brilliance, definitely an award winning performance.Robert De Niro: another award winning performance, definitely portrays the Jimmy Conway character with passion and most certainly the: ""cautious yet violent gangster""Joe Pesci: another award winning role, he's not on screen as much as Liotta but he makes sure you know him when he is on screen. He is the perfect psychotic gangster actor to ever live, he may be short but never get under his skin, don't even swear at him, or your dead.All in all, this film is a masterpiece, from start to finish, each character is portrayed with passion and with heart. Certainly on the levels of The Godfather and Scarface."
479573,False,"Goodfellas is one of Martin Scorsese's best works. Based on a true story, it is about the rise and fall of Henry Hill( Ray Liotta), Jimmy Conway( Robert Deniro) and Tommy DeVito( Joe Pesci). It is fast paced, stylish and full of memorable scenes.Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Loraine Bracco give excellent performances. Pesci steals the show as the violent gangster. Robert Deniro also plays his part well. Direction is superb and so is the writing.This is definitely the best gangster movie after THe Godfather and The Godfather part 2. Watch it. Strongly recommended (9/10)"
479574,False,"Goodfellas is one of the best gangster movies released in years. The acting was top notch, it is well paced, the cinematography is well done and it has a good story. This films chronicles the life of Henry Hill from when he was a teenager, when he first became a gangster and his life in the mob. Ray Liotta did a great job portraying the main character Henry Hill. Robert De Niro was amazing as Jimmy Conway. Joe Pesci did a fantastic job playing Tommy DeVito. Joe Pesci is one of Hollywood's best actors around. He can play the most violent and foul-mouthed meanies to the guy you would want to be friends with. I thought Casino was slightly better than this film but this is still an awesome movie. This would be my second favourite Scorsese film. If you like Martin Scorsese, I would definitely recommend this movie alongside with Casino. This movie is a true masterpiece. Martin Scorsese's second best film."
479575,False,"Alright this is going to be a long review because i have so much to say about this film. First off this one of the or the best mafia film ever made. It stars a bang up cast of world class actors, ray liotta, joe pesci, robert deniro, paul sorvino and the list goes on and on. It was written and dircted by Martin Scorscese who is considered by many to be the best film maker of all time.This movie follows the true story of Henry Hill (Liotta) a young man who started working for the mob when he was just a teenager. The movie gives a very detailed view of his life and all the trouble he faced through out it.This is easily Ray Liottas finest hour and this movie is the reason he even got into Hollywood. Also it has a bang up performances from Robert deniro and joe pesci. Mob movies would not be the same without those two in them. This movie all comes together perfectly made possible by the fantastic writing of Scorsese and the immaculate acting of all those involved. I highly recommend this to everyone hands down the best mafia film ever made"
479576,False,"Goodfellas is a pretty mesmerizing film. Martin Scorsese at his best is an incredibly dynamic director and Goodfellas is most certainly one of his greatest achievements. For a film that clocks in at two and a half hours it sure moves at a fast pace. This is a movie that never lags. There is no waste. It's a master-class in how to keep an audience glued to a screen.It documents the story of Henry Hill the real life gangster. Like the 30's gangster films it's a rise and fall epic, but unlike these the resolution is a lot more ambiguous and the overall presentation is considerably more complex. I'm not sure how close the film is to actual events, but I do realize that some principal characters have had their names changed for some reason. Ultimately, the level of actual authenticity doesn't matter very much as this is a superlative film either way.Scorsese has never been afraid to go to extremes. This film like many of his others is very raw. Language and violence are strong; the latter, very much so in the murder of the character Billy Batts. The brutality adds an undeniable visceral appeal to the film. Yet it does still seem entirely justifiable within the context of the story. Acting is universally top drawer with everybody giving terrific performances. Although special mention does have to go to Joe Pesci whose character Tommy is seriously unforgettable. Tommy is a pint-sized sociopath with a pretty monumental chip on his shoulder. Most film-makers would never have recognized that an actor as small as Pesci would be ideal for the role of this character. But Pesci's size and high-pitched voice only add to his menace somehow, it's as if these defects of his character make Tommy even more at war with the world and make him an even more bitter and dangerous guy. Scorsese's trademark use of popular music is excellently incorporated into the film. The tunes by turns indicate the time period, parallel the events and add an ironic backdrop to proceedings. It's a textbook example of how to compose a soundtrack with contemporary music but in a way that adds depth and meaning.In a nutshell, Goodfellas is arguably the best gangster film out there. As a piece of cinema, it is thrilling. Recommended unreservedly."
479577,False,"The gangster movie has gone through a lot of changes, especially since being reinvented as high drama with The Godfather pictures in the 1970s. Such classics soon become clichés and in the 80s gangster movies were often spoofs (Prizzi's Honor, Married to the Mob). Goodfellas opened a new chapter of serious yet very stylish crime flicks.Goodfellas was, back then, a comparative rarity in the genre in that it is based on a true story. And storywise it is as a much a documentary as it is a good yarn. Most scenes, when considered individually are simply revelations of gangster life, and the almost constant narration more or less acknowledges this. It's only when viewed as a whole that an entire story arc starts to emerge. But there is also continual structure in the arrangement of each little anecdote. Take for example the pair of scenes in the bar with ""Spider"". These go together, but you need to know that some time has passed in between them. Writers Nicholas Pilleggi and Martin Scorsese throw in a quick in-between-scene of Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco arguing. This demonstrates that other events have gone on in the meantime, but also keeps the tense, gritty atmosphere riding along. The vibrant language and frequent diversions into wisecracking make this a forerunner to the dialogue-for-the-sake-of-dialogue school of screen writing which Quentin Tarantino would soon specialise in.Martin Scorsese's direction closely follows the narration, both in its content and its snappy pace. Like Hitchcock his camera is constantly roving around, leading us by the hand and making us look at things. In effect he's illustrating Henry Hill's words. And often he's showing a little more than that. Sometimes there's a cheeky counterpoint between words and images. There are also some clever pull-back-and-reveal shots. In one early shot we see a close-up of some liquor changing hands. The camera pulls out to show that the booze is being used to bribe a couple of cops. We are continually bombarded with ideas, continually pushed and pulled through the narrative. Of course, a lot of Scorsese's technical business here  the zooms, jump cuts and lengthy tracking shots are just cinematic wheelies, and headache-inducing ones at that. But so long as you can put up with them you have to admire the rhythmic precision with which the whole thing has been put together.There is however another downside to the overtly technical style at work here. We don't really get to see the performances at their best. Poor old Ray Liotta probably did the best work of his life here, but it's all chopped up in little bits, and all we get is occasional looks, flashes, half-gestures. The same goes for Lorraine Bracco. Robert De Niro apparently did extensive research into his character, but there doesn't seem to have been much point since he is more or less the same as all the other Italian American gangsters he has played in his career. The only player who really comes out well here is Joe Pesci. Pesci has such charisma and presence that he commands attention even in small doses. It also helps that his style is very much in tune with the punchy dialogue and staccato rhythm of the whole piece.Coming from the peak in Scorsese's abilities as a director of tight control over every aspect, Goodfellas could easily have fallen into the trap of being nothing but a showy technical exercise. The only thing that saves it is the fact that its subject matter is so interesting. Old and established as the gangster movie is, this one reveals so many sordid truths and fascinating facts about that lifestyle, and does so in such a direct, never-a-dull-moment manner, that it gives the whole genre a jolting jump-start."
479578,False,"This is a perfect movie.It all came together for Scorsese, a true magician of cinema.After brilliant films such as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, the acting performances, soundtrack, suspense, comedy, violence, setting, were all interwoven to a tee.Liotta must deserve credit, carrying the film the whole way. But there were also mentionable acting performances from his wife (Karen), Mori, and Pauli Cicero.De Niro in my opinion is one of the greatest actors in cinematic history, and Joe Pesci you can't go wrong with in any movie centered around violence/the mafia/blood/humour.10/10 A must watch for ANYONE."
479579,False,Not only is this the best mob movie ever made. It is the best movie ever made. Everything about it is perfect from the acting to the fantastic soundtrack and the great directing from the legendary Martin Scorsese. If you have not seen this yet make sure you see it soon you wont be disappointed. Joe Pesci is fantastic in his Oscar winning role as Tommy Devito. But the best acting in the movie was done by then newcomer Ray Liotta. His narration and the way he delivers his lines is great. This movie was nominated for best picture but was beat by Dances with Wolves which was great but did not deserve the Oscar. This movie is a classic and should be a required viewing for any gangster movie fan. Make sure you see this outstanding classic of a mob movie. A masterpiece.
479580,False,"Scorsese brings to us another of his masterpieces.After the score of Raging Bull he brings a gangster flick to us that just tears us apart.Best since the time of the Godfather.Or i can say you can compare it even to the Godfather.This is tied for me as the best film of Gangster era i have seen with the Godfather Part 2.The casting is perfect.Robert De Niro,Joe Pesci & Ray Liotta are all superb.Lorraine Bracco is sensational.Paul Sorvino reminds us of the dons used to be in that of the Godfather.The story never looses tempo.Audience tries to predict the ending but then is just not able to predict the end.The narration of Liotta is fabulous.Gripping narration & perfect crime gangster flick.Scorsese should have got the Oscar for this one.The entry of the drugs & narcotics later on just adds so much more to the film.Based on a true story its a terrific adaptation with pretty cool dialogs like 100% Italian stuff.Henry Hill said as far back as he remembered,he always wanted to be a gangster.But surely for the acting of Joe Pesci,for the presence of De Niro,for the narration of Ray Loitta,for the brilliance of Scorsese,as far as i remember,i ain't gonna forget this one for a long time to come."
479581,False,"In the opening moments of GoodFellas, a movie about the tradecraft and culture of organized crime in New York, our storyteller Henry Hill says that for as long as he can remember, he always wanted to be a gangster, that it was better than being President. That he voice-overs his own life, later joined by his wife, narrating her side, is pivotal to the movie's ingenuity. Though the film refuses to judge its characters, it's not an omniscient portrayal, but a frame of reference rooted in yearning for the life. What's more, alternating dual narration causes us to see scenes in different ways. ""These were blue-collar guys,"" Hill's wife rationalizes. ""The only way they could make real extra money was to go out and cut a few corners."" Their influence was, and is, exhilarating. ""If we wanted something, we just took it,"" Henry says. ""If anyone complained twice they got hit so bad, believe me, they never complained again."" After all of his harrowing experiences, Henry, played by Ray Liotta in the stand-out performance of his career, still carps, still misses all the good times. And after literally having seen this film possibly a hundred or more times, I still watch.The screenplay is both based on Nicholas Pileggi's biography of Hill, and Scorsese's own Little Italy recollections. The early scenes showcase adolescent Henry as an errand boy for the local Brooklyn mob. A shot of him peering out his tenement window reflects Scorsese's own schoolday reminiscences of the neighborhood. So does the reverse-shot which utilizes quiet slow-motion for closeups of mobsters' shiny shoes, slick ties, greased-back hair, ostentatious rings, smoldering cigars. In a movie legendary for violence that happens by surprise, one of the most jolting kicks comes when Henry's beaten by his father for missing school. He had to ""take a few beatings"" at home owing to his teenage professional pursuit, but it was a small price. Violence is like the tempo beneath every scene. The percussion is the fruits of unwarranted benefits. Henry's accomplice Jimmy Conway emerges into his first shot with Robert De Niro's special brand of broadcasted constraint. His mannerisms say, ""Don't worry. You'll all get autographs if you're patient."" Henry's other partner is the unforgettable Tommy DeVito, in an extraordinary performance by Joe Pesci, who oversteps his influence rather than letting it imply itself.Henry's enthusiasm for his developing profession is tangible. In the movie's most talked-about shot, he takes his future wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco gives it her all) to the Copacabana. There's a line in front, but he squires her across the street, downstairs through service hallways, the kitchen area, out into the showroom right as their table's being set right in front of the stage. This uninterrupted three-minute shot is not just a cameraman's feat: It's a bold technique showing how the whole world appears to unravel readily before young Henry Hill. There's another particularly extended shot, as Henry acquaints us with his fellow gangsters. Henry leads the camera through a packed speakeasy, calling out names as the characters nod to the camera, mutter to Henry. The camera appears to track Henry, yet appears to be his POV; sometimes he's talking to them, sometimes to us. We're included in the scene. The cinematographer, Michael Ballhaus, was a central accomplice. Cultivating Scorsese's trademark form, he quite rarely lets his camera be stationary. It's so often in motion, if just slightly, making us not cold bystanders but complicit witnesses.Alongside the violence is an account of capitalistic striving. Henry and Karen come from circumstances that couldn't freely result in Cadillacs, Vegas excursions, fur coats. She rationalizes what he has to do to finance their prestige. The movie centralizes Henry's climb through the mob, then down into prison sentences and full-blown duplicity. Initially the mob looks to be an augmentation of his life, then eventually, after he begins selling drugs, there's a hemmed-in diminishing. The camera style in the earlier scenes ritualizes his network of control with all-encompassing grace. Near the end, in an intoxicatingly berserk segment huddled in one day, the form gets hectic and jerky as he hustles frenziedly around the neighborhood on family and criminal errands while a helicopter constantly feels like it's fluttering above. This is one of the most virtuoso film sequences I have ever seen.What Scorsese does that makes GoodFellas so universally adored is infect us with his exhilaration with the material. It has the breakneck propulsion of a storyteller who can't wait to see your reaction. Scorsese's camera embraces these guys, listens to their shoes clicking, beholds the tailoring of their clothes. And when they're plotting the fabled Lufthansa job, he has them whispering together in a tight three-shot that has their heads bent low and close with the rush of their own awesomeness. What a rush it is for them to steal.The film's way is to sever dialogue with brutality. We see some of cinema's most effective cries wolf, as in Pesci's legendary restaurant scene where Tommy would like to know what Henry meant when he said he was a funny guy. Other instants amplify abruptly out of the sheer mob environment: The way a mistaken drink order leads to blood. The way kidding around in a bar leads to a man being viciously brutalized. The way the violence bayonets the everyday lives of the characters is invariably enforced. Tommy, Henry and Jimmy, with a body in their trunk, stop at Tommy's mother's house to get a knife, and she insists they sit down at 3 a.m. for spaghetti. Scorsese feels so in control of his powerful talent here. It describes crime's allure for an insatiable young man who's determined from childhood beatings not to resent power, but long for it. When Henry talks to us at the beginning, it sounds like a classic Hollywood dream-come-true picture."
479582,False,"Martin Scorsese is hailed by many as the greatest living American filmmaker, but with the passing of Swedish master auteur Ingmar Bergman in 2007, I would argue that Scorsese is the greatest living filmmaker in the world. ""Goodfellas"" is a perfect example of the brilliance of Scorsese, as he takes his audience inside a world that is often misunderstood by the general population.The film feels unbelievably authentic, not just because it's based on actual events, but because Scorsese understands this world as well as any filmmaker ever could. Growing up on the streets of Manhattan's Lower East Side, Scorsese had plenty of exposure to the violent world of the ""Mafia."" Scorsese understands better than anyone the destructive nature of the ""mafia"" lifestyle, but he also understands how appealing it can be. That is what makes ""Goodfellas"" such an incredibly powerful film, the fact that the characters are not portrayed as one-dimensional villains, but are presented as ordinary men who have been seduced by the lifestyle from an early age.Scorsese does a masterful job of creating a world where death seems like an inevitability. The famous ""Funny Guy"" scene is one of the most powerful scenes in movie history because it so effectively captures the volatility of the mafia lifestyle. The truth is, your best friend one day, can become your worst enemy the next. Nothing gets in the way of business, and as a result, friendships are of secondary importance. No filmmaker is better at probing the psyches of violent men than Scorsese. He burrows into the world of the mafia and doesn't attempt to sugarcoat it, which results in a film that is incredibly violent and profane, but never gratuitous.""Goodfellas"" is not only a masterpiece and one of the greatest films of the 1990s, but it is further proof that Martin Scorsese is a filmmaker of incomparable talent."
479583,False,"No matter how many times you watch it, Goodfellas is one of those movies which you just never grow out of. Arguably the best gangster film of the decade (but I think of all time). Martin Scorsese is able to generate just about every kind of tone a film could have; humorous, touching, depressing, grim. This is superbly written and acted, and ten times more down-to-Earth and involving than the Godfather. If there is anyone out there who hasn't seen Goodfellas.....see it.The first thing we see on screen are the words 'The following is based on a true story' or something like that. In the twenty first century, those words are the hottest marketing gig going. Goodfellas was before those days. Next we meet Henry Hill, who became a gangster at grade school age, and went on to become hot stuff. He helped pull off the famous Lufthansa heist, but did he and his buddies get away with it? Goodfellas is able to cover about three and a half decades in two hours, without felling too slow or too fast. The story, is direct and detailed, and allows the viewer to become 'one of the boys'. Goodfellas feels like a party almost, with an occasional ballroom brawl here and there.I'm assuming because of its Oscar snub, that the film wasn't very popular when it was released, but of course brilliance doesn't come right away. It took years for the world to recognize just how groundbreaking Citizen Kane was. No movie is perfect, but Goodfellas is pretty close."
479584,False,"I generally back away from gangster films. It's not my favorite genre. I have trouble with the aggrandizement of this amoral subcult. This, however, is a masterpiece. It's almost documentary in its portrayal of this society of evil. Martin Scorsese has assembled the cream of the crop of actors who have cut their teeth on the successors of the Godfather. I can't begin to do justice to all the actors in this film. What I can attest to is the danger that lurks in every scene. In one scene the hard wired character played by Joe Pesci (marvelous and crazy) shoot a guy named ""Spider"" for not getting him the right drink. The rest of the men must sit there, without compassion, because this is a normal day, with ""normal"" events. There is also the second group. The wives and the families who are stuck in the middle of all this, pretending their husbands work nine-to-five jobs, while they are out hitting people. Ultimately, there is Robert de Niro who is the craziest of all. Played with subtle control, he dominates every scene. This is a true masterpiece that's hard to watch."
479585,False,"Scorsese's 'Goodfellas', Based on the non-fiction book Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi, is one of the most riveting biopics to have hit the Silver Screen. The film follows the rise and fall of three gangsters, spanning three decades, which grows onto, and becomes a dazzling experience, overall.'Goodfellas' keeps you engrossed in those 136-minutes, it makes you feel the decades it's past. It's a fantastic film, it's special because the legendary ""F"" word is used approximately 300 times, now that's truly something. Scorsese's direction and execution to the material, is, as always, brilliant. The Cult Filmmaker can never be doubted, as simple as that. Nicholas Pileggi's screenplay is perfect, he knew the subject more than anyone else. Coming to the performances, Joe Pesci steals the show. He's mesmerizing in a role a that Won him the Academy-Award. Ray Liotta is excellent, delivering his careers best performance. Robert De Niro is flawless, yet again. Lorraine Bracco is very sincere; very good. Others are satisfactory.A must watch movie... Two Big Thumbs Up!"
479586,False,"this is easily martin Scorsese's best mafia movie. i don't care if no-one agrees with me on this one. also the soundtrack is stunning, apart from scarface i think the best gangster soundtrack ever. the scene where sunshine of your love by cream is playing is just one of the top 10 DE niro moments(with 1 being taxi driver mirror monologue!!). and the other scene with Eric Clapton's Layla part 2 is brilliant. it just makes it so authentic!!!. exaclty what Scorsese is the master of.""never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut!"". Jimmy ""The Gent"" Conway - De Niro (Goodfellas) 1990"
479587,False,"There are certain films that change cinema, films that are less about entertainment and more about painting a glorious canvas onto the silver screen that marks a shift in direction all movies must now follow. ""Casablanca"", ""The Great Ditactor"", ""Star Wars"", ""Citizen Kane"", films that alter the way you look at the medium - whether you like them or not, you still appreciate the craftsmanship that went into making the film. Personally, I'm not big on gangster movies but I believe that ""Goodfellas"" should be included on that list and judging by its near-permanent position at the top end of the IMDb's top 250, so do lots of others.Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill, a young man growing up in New York in the Sixties and slowly working his way into the schemes of local mob boss Paul Cicero (Paul Sivero) alongside the psychotic Tommy DeVito (a menacing Joe Pesci) and the cool-headed hit-man Jimmy Conway (Robert De Nero. As the years go by, Henry's success brings him riches beyond his wildest dreams but it also comes at a price. His marriage to Karen (Lorraine Bracco) is built on shaky ground and as the stakes get ever higher, Henry finds himself increasingly isolated as friends and associates either desert him or get whacked.Setting the bar for gangster movies ever since, ""Goodfellas"" is one of those landmark pictures that deserves respect. Like ""The Godfather"" before it, this feels horrifyingly authentic and utterly convincing but seeing as this is a Scorsese flick, that shouldn't come as a surprise. What does shock is how good Pesci is. He is like a mini stick of dynamite in a suit, ready to explode at a moment's notice and you simply can't take your eyes of him. Right from the infamous ""What's so funny?"" scene, Pesci owns this film. Liotta and De Niro, seasoned bad guy actors in their own right, can't hold a candle to him - indeed, Pesci has struggled to escape this role ever since. But all cast members are faultless in ""Goodfellas"", another Scorsese trademark. And yet another is a supreme soundtrack and like ""The Departed"", this is also a great film to listen to with songs you wouldn't expect to hear - the piano exit to ""Layla"" gives the whole film an epic feel that raises the hair on the back of your neck.It may lack the grandeur of ""The Godfather"" or the scale of ""Once Upon A Time In America"" but what makes ""Goodfellas"" unmissable, in my opinion, is how utterly convincing it is as a mob film. This feels as raw, violent and brutal as you'd expect and at times, you're watching through your fingers at these (let's face it) pretty reprehensible individuals indulging in a life of crime and violence seemingly untouchable by the law. My only real complaint, and it is slight, is that because it feels so real that I can't really call it entertaining - you wouldn't put it on TV while you having dinner, for example. So this is less a film and more of an event, something special that any movie fan worthy of the label owes it to themselves to watch. Being as this is only the second Scorsese film I've seen, I will admit to liking ""The Departed"" more but this is still a supremely good film, full of menace and tension throughout. So be a wise-guy and go get the DVD or else I'll send Fat Tony over to whack you!"
479588,False,"I will divide my review into following 5 categories each accounting a maximum of 100%(if perfect) ________________________________________________________________ Visual Pleasure:[75%] This is a classic mobster movie. I've seen quite a few mobster movies including all-time greats like Godfather 1,2; but i've never been visually pleased with them. They are all smooth but none of them visually stun me.Director's Work:[100%] Martin Scorsese is a legend. I feel everything he does is flawless. With this film again he has done an exceptional job. Any director couldn't have done anything more to make this film better.Acting:[100%] This is the best part of the movie. Every actor fits into his/her role perfectly. The execution and the dialogue delivery from all the actors was truly remarkable.Entertainment Value:[71%] This is the thing that let me down. I wasn't fully entertained by this movie and this factor contributes a lot in my rating. Sure there were some parts that I liked a lot but not as a whole. Maybe people who love Gangster movies will like it a lot more than I did.Script:[90%] The script was again very good. The narration and screenplay was also impressive.__________________________________________________________________ My Advice: People who loved Godfather will love this one. Anyone out there looking for a well-acted and a well-directed film, this one is for you._____ 7.4/10"
479589,False,"This is one of those movies that's pretty much nothing but classic scenes. Thinking about ""Goodfellas"" is essentially re-imagining the entire movie, usually starting of with Joe Pesci. Pesci's is by far the most threatening character in this movie, and the atmosphere gets really tensed when someone gets in his way somehow. He doesn't want to be pushed, and you don't want him to be pushed. The scene where he asks what makes him funny is one of the most uncomfortable moments ever caught on film. This movie often feels uncomfortable in fact. Whenever any secondary character is involved in a conversation, you know something will go wrong. The shady background characters in this movie really drop like flies, this movie has an incredible amount of raw violence and ice cold death scenes. Even by the standards of a classic crime movie, this movie just feels really harsh and unpleasant. Which doesn't make it any less entertaining, by the way, this movie really knows when to move on. I'm not going as far as calling this the best gangster film ever made, but it's up there."
479590,False,"This review is based on the 2-Disc Special Edition release. I haven't read the novel, nor do I know anything about Hill that this film didn't tell me, but I understand that that this is a faithful adaptation, and that both give an honest recounting of his life. This can perhaps best be described as a portrayal of the environment, showing good and bad alike. The glamorous nature of that way of life is put up on the screen, and you definitely understand its appeal. Scorsese doesn't fail us for a second of this. It is brutal, funny, charming, bloody, intense and entertaining. The writing is excellent. Narration as well as dialog are incredible and highly memorable and quotable. The plot is interesting and develops nicely. Strong storytelling is one of the things that keeps you watching. The characters and personalities is another. Cinematography and editing are top-notch. The scoring is spot-on, with every music piece being fantastic and fitting(directly or ironically) at the same time. Every single acting performance is perfect, not only Liotta, Pesci and of course DeNiro. The pacing is marvelous. Mood and atmosphere are established masterfully. The language doesn't hold back, neither in tone nor in amount. There is some sexuality, not terribly graphic. Violence is unrestrained. This has disturbing content. The DVD comes with four featurettes(coming to about an hour in running time, all put together), as well as two commentary tracks... ""Cast and Crew""(self-explanatory) and ""Cop and Crook""(the actual Henry, and one of the feds who worked against the mob). All of it is worth the time. I recommend this to fans of gangster movies and/or authentic, biographical ones. Just make sure you can handle it. 10/10"
479591,False,"When he was asked to name the best films of the 1990s, film critic Roger Ebert not only ranked Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" as the best next to ""Fargo"" (1996) but also labeled it ""the best mob movie ever."" A friend of Scorsese's, Ebert also labeled the filmmaker as the finest director in the United States today. To me, ""Goodfellas"" is not the best film about organized crime. That reward goes to ""The Godfather"" (1972). But if there ever was a film to replace ""The Godfather"" (1972) as the best mafia movie, ""Goodfellas"" would be it.""Goodfellas"" is one of those rare cases where a true story about violence and ferocity is adapted for the screen but without bringing it to a glorious sense like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962). The said 60s film took a tale of heroism mixed with narcissistic violence to create a sweeping epic. What Scorsese does is take the dark plot of the underworld and the mafia and make it look exactly like what it was and still is today. It is a fabulous retelling of the story of Henry Hill, a part-Italian kid who grew up amongst the mobsters and sought to become one of them.Unlike other mob movies, ""Goodfellas"" does not make heroes or role models out of its characters. The movie centers around the people of the mafia underworld and avoids the civilians who would ultimately become victims of them and their ways. Instead, Scorsese and co-screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi make cruel and dislikable characters and masterfully command the cast into representing them. Most particularly is the character played by Joe Pesci. The character, again based on a real-life person, is like a tender human explosive. Just touch the surface of it and it goes off, tearing or blowing apart anything that provokes it. Pesci's character is the kind of man who if you insult him verbally, even as a joke, he will beat you half to death or just whip out his gun and empty it into your heart and then sit down and finish whatever he was doing in the first place and not shed a tear or let out a sigh of regret over your mangled remains. Like a wild animal, he is unpredictable and cannot be controlled; only put down. And the sickening thing is that Robert De Niro's character is actually fond of this monstrosity of a man. We only learn the bad sides of these men; not their good sides, for they probably lost it all when they joined the mafia. We see them cheat on their spouses, murder people in broad daylight, traffic drugs, destroy property, and again, they do it for their own satisfaction. There's no morality, not even among themselves. The movie opens with a brutal scene of what these men do and yet the Ray Liotta character immediately states afterward: ""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster. To me, being a gangster was better than being President of the United Statesit was there that I knew that I belonged.""This is a brutal and savage world these men lived in and Martin Scorsese excellently brings this back to screen to give us a new impression of the mafia and reminds us that these kind of people still exist today and are not heroes or images for civilized people not even in the vaguest sense. In regards to the cast, it is perfect. Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci (who won an Oscar for his performance) were quintessentially cast in their roles. The only part I thought was wrongly developed was Lorraine Bracco's character. I just felt the character was either too over the top or Bracco overacted a little, but this is a forgivable weakness and it's hardly a weakness at all. There is also the two-and-a-half-hour running time, which I felt was just a little too long. But these few minor flaws aside, ""Goodfellas"" is certainly one of the most important films of the past twenty years in an era where Hollywood seems to have lost its motivation for films beyond the conventional range."
479592,False,"I absolutely adore this film. It's clever, shocking, funny, violent, educational and entertaining.The entire cast play their parts brilliantly, from the spine-tingling Tommy, to the smooth, under-control Jimmy.The film catches the zeitgeist in an exceptional manner, and shows both sides of the coin when you're a gangster - the perks and the ugly side.Scorcese's use of comedy, mixed with horrific moments brings the film into a different light, as it is not just about being dangerous and deadly, but there are also humorous elements added to the mix as well.Overall, the film shows that loyalty has its benefits, but in the end, the friend who screws the other over first will be the one that gets away with everything."
479593,False,"One of my favorite films of all time, second only to A Few Good men, this darkly comic and boldly violent gangster epic is a true masterpiece. Featuring career-best performances from Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco as well as a career-making one from Joe Pesci, who fully deserved his Academy Award.The film follows a 30-year period in the lives of Henry Hill (Liotta) and his association with the Italian Mafia. The script features some of the most laugh-out-loud moments ever in a serious crime drama (all the good bits are delivered with extra zing by Pesci), and also some of the most expletive-filled rants (once again, courtesy of Pesci). The violence won't be for all tastes, but it's necessary in this story, especially when the script constantly surprises you and you start realizing that you have no idea who might live and who might die or who's going to jail and who'll live happy ever after.Because as Henry soon finds out, once you're in the family, there's no way out. Special mention has to be made of Scorsese's brilliant directing, which includes some glorious unbroken tracking shots and a 60's Motown soundtrack that's to die for. A classic in every sense of the word."
479594,False,"Goodfellas, although somewhat exaggerated in a few situations, follows pretty closely, the life and uncertain times of the half Irish half Italian wannabe wise-guy, Henry Hill. From his teenage years running errands for the neighborhood Mafioso's while rising through the ranks by hijacking truckloads of cigarettes, to him being on top of his limited but somewhat powerful mob world, to the deepest part of a cocaine addiction and digging shallow graves to bury a not dead body that was in the trunk of his car. All in all, this depiction of the wise-guy lifestyle, along with the actions taken by these men in order to carry on with this lifestyle, is done in a way that has oft been imitated but never duplicated. A wonderful story, made into a superb film."
479595,False,"While I had previously seen this Martin Scorsese picture before, it was on network television which meant I didn't hear the profanity and the violent scenes were trimmed. Despite that, I remember enjoying the movie very much. Now that I've seen it uncensored and on HD DVD, it doesn't impress me as much as before perhaps because in jumping several years in various segments, you half wonder what happened during those in-between times. Still, Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Larraine Bracco impress with their performances with Paul Sorvino lending gravity with his appearances throughout and nice cameos by up-and-coming newcomers like Illeana Douglas, Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, and Michael Imperioli. Also amusing were cameos by the director's parents, Catherine and Charles, especially Catherine's as Pesci's mother. Pesci may be the most impressive of the bunch in his Oscar-winning role as Tommy who turns from highly amused to very angry at a dime. Perhaps not one for the mainstream crowd who wants at least one likable character to identify with but a mostly compelling account of the true story of what mob life really was like for someone who lived through it."
479596,False,"Goodfellas is truly a masterpiece, and definitely the best piece of directing Scorsese ever accomplished.This is such a fast paced movie, it will keep you on the edge of your seat, at no point does this movie bore the audience. There are no bad scenes, the whole movie just flows.What I loved about this movie, was it was an amazing movie version of the book, almost 100% the same as the novel.And the story is just perfect to be made into a movie, it is a sad story of the mafia.Usually I am not the biggest fan of the mafia movies, but this one is just excellent because it is different then every other one. The first act shows all the stereotypical Hollywood movie that merely glorifies the mob, and then the 2nd act shows the evil side of the mafia."
479597,False,"Martin Scorsese is just quite simply one of the influenced film-makers in the business. All his films are done with style and character. ""Goodfellas"" (1990) is a film which felt so realistic (it's based on a true story) and the way it was put together just looked impossible (with the editing,the dialog voice-overs, the angles, the setting, etc...) but that's what film-making is all about: making the impossible possible on the big screen and Scorsese did that and he succeeded. I can now see where Quentin Tarantino came from with his influences which I find fascinating. Goodfellas, in my opinion is better than the Godfather films and any other rip-offs. I just don't understand why this film didn't win best film of 1990 (""Dances with wolves"", what were they thinking!). It was because of the violence and the ironic thing is that's what the film's about: a life of violence in the mafia and all the film is doing is trying to show how violence is in reality (which is very important). Goodfellas is by far the greatest gangster film ever made in a long time and it's martin scorsese's best film along with 1976's Taxi Driver (the film that showed how an individual can be just be a complete nutter). Another great film which has won its place in my 100 greatest films of all time. 10/10"
479598,False,"I absolutely ****ing love it! I watched it a couple of weeks ago for the first time and i was captivated. Scorsese worked his magic on the story of Henry Hill, as being a 16 year old by i have become fascinated with. He's an Itlaian-Irish gangster and he produced in my opinion one of the best films ever made. De Niro, Liotta and Pesci shine in the film but i think its Lorraine Bracco who plays Karen who absolutely steals the show, playing the Jewish girl from a quiet neighbourhood, thrown into the world of Cocaine dealing, murders and violence. Its undoubtedly one of my favourite films and I'm sure it will be for a long time. How the film is mainly narration is what i really love about it, and along with the soundtrack by artists such as the Crystals and Shangri-las, make this film amazing and brilliant to watch!"
479599,False,"""Goodfellas"" is Martin Scorsese's highest ranked movie over at IMDb. I had never seen it before 2 days ago and to be honest it wasn't what I expected it to be. Don't get me wrong, it is all in all a great movie, but like Scorsese's movies usually it's over-hyped. ""Goodfellas"" is based on a true story and it tells a story about Henry Hill who grows up to be a gangster, a part of the mob. Along with his friends, other wiseguys Tommy DeVito and Jimmy Conway, the movie tells about how organized the mafia really is and follows the rise and fall of Henry Hill from the beginning till the end.The movie progresses very well with the narration of Henry Hill, who's played by Ray Liotta. The narration's excellent and keeps the movie going in a good flow with it's precise use of words and witty sarcasm. I've never been so impressed of Liotta's performance than I was after this movie, he does his best role performance yet to date and does it by far. Liotta evolves the character so realistically, by emotions and doing the whole progress of the character's corruption in a so believable way. The role of Tommy DeVito is played by Joe Pesci who has always been enjoyable for me, he has that personal voice and essence which can't be compared to any actor. I've never seen Joe Pesci in such a serious role before and to me he did some fine job in it. He also does his best role performance yet to date. Then there's the mighty Robert De Niro, who plays the role of Jimmy Conway, and you can't go wrong with De Niro now can you? He is perfect for the role and to be honest the whole cast is chosen very specifically, each right actor/actress for the right role. Amazing role performances indeed.The screenplay is brilliant, the story in its wholeness is a real treat for you and that's one of the reasons why you can't miss this movie. Sadly, the movie suffers from one significant problem; It's too long and that is pretty much the only reason why it doesn't deserve a 10. The first hour goes very smoothly and things keep on going all the time, you don't get bored in any part. After that it kinda stops, I wouldn't say it's downhill after that but I'd say it just stops the whole smoothness and the flow. I hate to say this, but it does get slightly too boring, hence why I said it's too long. I feel so bad because of it as this would have been a perfect movie without it being too long. The second hour just isn't nearly as interesting as the first, a real shame indeed. What comes to direction, well it's Scorsese and to me it's pretty much as excellent as it can get. You just have to admire that style of his, being oddly joyful in parts where sadness should take place. The whole soundtrack is also very Martin Scorsese stylish, not including any beautiful compositions but some really groovy and great tracks, which also play an important role in the whole progress of the movie.""Goodfellas"" is a great movie, but for me personally it was rather disappointing. Having an average rating of 8.7 at IMDb it should be amazing, shouldn't it? Maybe the slight disappointment is because of the movie being over-hyped, yeah, most certainly. Despite it being a slight disappointment for me it's still a definite recommendation for all of you who love great movies. You don't have to like mob movies in general, as this movie gives the whole mob thing some real depth in it, giving a realistic sort of an inside-look of it. It's not phenomenal, but it's definitely a great movie."
479600,False,"If you have not seen ""GoodFellas"" yet, then my question for you is this: Why? ""GoodFellas,"" in addition to being the most accurate movie about life in the mafia, is also one of the greatest films of all time! The film is the story of the rise and fall of real-life gangster Henry Hill (played very well by Ray Liotta), his marriage to Karen Hill (Lorraine Bracco), and his friendship to fellow mobsters Jimmy Conaway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci, in his Oscar-winning role), as well as friendship to mob boss Paulie Sicero (Paul Sorvino). The film is full of great performances, all lead by the one, the only, Martin Scorsese, who is at the tip top of his game in this film. It's entertaining, brilliant, and, above all, a masterpiece. If you have yet to see it, see it NOW! You won't be disappointed."
479601,False,"This is one of the greatest movies of all time never mind the best mob movie. It has an amazing and realistic plot with outstanding performances from Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco and all of the other actors and actress's in the film. When watching in it didn't want to blink in case i missed something. Martin Scorsese is an amazing director all of his films i have seen i have loved. If you enjoyed the departed you would love this. It is mainly considered a film for men seen as women normally enjoy soppy romantic movies and men like the hard gritty stuff, well i'm a fan of both and i think anyone with any taste in film will love this. It will stay on my Favorites list forever."
479602,False,"""Goodfellas"" in my opinion is one of the greatest movies ever made, not just another mob classic but just an excellent piece of work. Martin Scorsese really did a great job guiding these already talented actors to do their best and produce such a great film. The actors did Oscar worthy performances, each playing the parts of a mob story based on real events. With Henry Hill played by Ray Liotta, Jimmy Conway played by Robert De Niro, Tommy DeVito played by Joe Pesci, Paul Cicero played by Paul Sorvino and Karen Hill played by Lorraine Bracco under the direction of Martin Scorsese, what more can you expect? The story of a young Italian/Irish American working his way through the levels of La Costa Nostra (the mob) is brought to life in this spectacular film. If you never seen this you should, whether your a mob movie fan, action, comedy, drama or especially a mixture of these, this is the film for you. 10/10 stars, 5/5 stars."
479603,False,"After renting the first three seasons of The Sopranos, I decided to rent Goodfellas, a film I had heard and read so many good things about. After watching the movie, I was a bit disappointed. The beginning of the film worked well for me - one could really get in the head of young Henry and understand what turned him on to the wise guy life. I loved the detail in the first third of the film. The storytelling took a bad turn for me, though. Everything after his marriage seemed to spiral out of a personal reality and into a ""this happened, and then that happened, and then that..."" form of storytelling. The last third just moved too fast for me; I lost my connection to the characters and by the time the end credits rolled around I wasn't connected to the gravity of what was going on. All in all, Goodfellas is a good film, but it is not the mob classic I was expecting it to be."
479604,False,"After watching this movie I had serious thoughts to changing my lifestyle. I wanted to be a gangster. I even went as far as to consult a couple of my Sicilian uncles who were formally associated with the Mafia. After repeating to my self continuously..""Your in your prime, no get this money""..I was filled with adrenaline as I raided my ex-girlfriends house and pistol whipped her new b/f with a pellet gun. I felt like superman for the next couple days...the bonus 23$ in the kids pocket really had my heart pumping..A few days pass and I'm laying in my bath with a cigar in my mouth right..a knock on the door startled me..""Open the f#$#$%# door POLICE""!...So I jump out the bathroom window completely naked, destroying my moms flower bed..I sprint across the neighborhood bare butt, making the matter ever more difficult ladies from all over were throwing themselves in front of me hoping to bump laps with their new Mob Lord. ONe of the older women took me in her house to hide..."
479605,False,"""After Joe Pesci's mother had seen the film, she told her son that the movie was good, but asked him if he had to swear so much.""
Sure, there have been lots of good gangster movies. But this one seems to be so different. I mean, there's the ""What do you mean I'm funny scene?"" There the guy who says everything twice ""I'm gonna go get the papers, get the papers."" There the kid who gets shot in the foot for being slow with the drinks. And there's the amazing story of Henry Hill as he becomes part of the gangster world, becoming friends with fellow gangsters Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, getting involved in drug, murder, crime, while having a wife, having kids, having a mistress, living the good life, getting high, turning in his friends, becoming part of a Witness Protection program, betraying everything that he had and grew to love and hate, doing the right and good thing but missing it all so terribly much in the end, all while giving amazing commentary to the whole movie, with wit, humor, tragedy, and a lot of cuss words. The most truthful and one of the best gangster movies was made in 1990, directed by Martin Scorsese. They were goodfellas.My grade: 9/10"
479606,False,"Movies don't get any better then this!The problem with gangster movies is that it always will be compared to the brilliant ""Godfather"" movies. Often when you do that you come to the conclusion that it's a very bad movie, however ""Goodfellas"" doesn't suffer from this curse. It's just as genius and at some points even better as the ""Godfather"" movies.That it's based on true events also makes the movie interesting to watch. Rarely has the live of a gangster been portrayed so wonderfully and interesting. The story is told in a wonderful way without getting boring for a single second. Who didn't wanted to be a gangster for a day after seeing this movie ???Next to the story there are three other truly great things about the movie: The cast, the characters and the dialogue. The cast is full with famous actor that all have been cast perfectly. Joe Pesci of course truly steals the show and it's no wonder he won a Oscar for his role. The famous ""You think I'm funny?"" scene with him is brilliant and amuses me every time, it truly is one of the best scene's of all time. A real classic! But let's not forget Ray Liotta and Robert De Niro who also give an amazing performance. Same goes for Catherine Scorsese as Joe Pesci's character Tommy's mother. She plays really natural and lot of fun scene's with great dialogue are the result. The wonderful stereotype gangster characters also add to this movie. How can you not like characters such as Frankie Carbone, Edward Stacks, Johnny two times, Morrie or Vinnie who puts too much tomatoes in the sauce. The movie is full with sharp and sometimes cruel but funny dialogue. All this things combined makes this a classic and magnificent movie, a movie that you MUST have at least seen once in your lifetime.The movie is full with many great long scene's. Some of the longest I have ever seen. Most of those long scene's are the highlight of the movie. Great directing from Martin Scorsese!Although it's a quite heavy movie it actually is also for some reason a fun movie to watch over and over again without getting ever boring.Nothing short of brilliant! A must see for everyone.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
479607,False,"If you hate mob movies, or hate Scorsese, then you probably won't be able to sit through this. But for the rest of us out there, this is arguably one of the best films of the 1990's, possibly one of the best of all time, and without a doubt one of the most influential films of the past twenty years. Every mob movie/underworld saga/generational tale/crime thriller from ""Pulp Fiction"" to ""Boogie Nights"" to ""Blow"" (which played like the TV movie version of a great Scorsese flick) to TV's ""The Sopranos"" owes a debt to this film. Scorsese was at the top of his game here, and what makes this film stand tall above all other movies of this ilk (including Scorsese's own ""Casino""--a great film in its own right) is that there is an overwhelming visceral charge to the film that makes it all seem so enjoyable despite the onslaught of blood, foul language, and unsavory activities. You are made to believe that these gangsters were having the time of their lives. So too were Scorsese and pals in making the film. And lastly, so too are we the audience in watching it all. Everything came together in this film so perfectly the viewer is left feeling oddly giddy amongst all the true life bloodshed. This sense of ""fun"" is the one thing that his recent ""Gangs of New York"" was missing, and may be what keeps that film from being ranked as one of the all time greats.As for the acting, Pesci is all at once hilarious and scary. De Niro is at his best. And Liotta gives a career defining performance (only in the recent ""Narc"" has he been able to recapture some of this magic). As for some of the finer details, I dare you to find a movie that makes better use of popular music or Steady-cam shots. The cinematography, editing, set designs and costumes (that traverse the varied stylings of the 1950's , 60's, 70's and early 80's) are all pitch perfect. Is there a better scene than when Liotta takes Lorraine Braco to the Copacabana for the first time and introduces her to the perks of gangster life while ""And Then he Kissed Me"" plays on the soundtrack? Will you ever be able to listen to ""Layla"" without thinking about mob hits and a frozen body in a meat truck? All these things, a communion with the audience (here we share Scorsese's joy both in making a film and in our watching it), top-notch production values, great performances, and a lasting influence on later films are the earmarks of a great movie, the pinnacle of a great director's career, and one of the greatest films of all time. ""Goodfellas"" may never reach the mythical status ""The Godfather"" saga did, but as great films like this are becoming few and far in between, it makes you believe in the myth of the ""greatest film of all time."" Maybe it is, most likely it isn't, but we the audience for a brief moment, maybe for just one scene, are pretty much convinced THIS IS IT."
479608,False,"Goodfellas is an all around great movie. If you don't immediately love it, it'll probably grow on you soon enough. Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco, and Joe Pesci all give the best performances in their careers and it is arguably Martin Scorsese's best directorial effort. Sure, it's up there among his best with Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, and Raging Bull, but this one just stands out more. I think what makes Goodfellas so great is it's compilation of elements like the acting, storytelling, character development, and dialogue. My One complaint is that Robert DeNiro is not in the movie as much as you'd expect, and I was always left wanting more. But maybe that's a good thing.Goodfellas is an amazing, unforgettable film that everyone should see. If you haven't already had the pleasure of seeing it, go rent it right now. It could just change your life.My Rating: 10/10"
479609,False,"When I saw ""Goodfellas"" I knew everything that was going to happen because it was based on a book called ""Wise Guys"" that I had read a few years before. Though I knew what was coming I was pleased with the acting, at it's best. The character were developed and depicted in a way that I though made them almost like heros. Some, like Pesci's , were amusing and sometimes funny. Conway was presented in a truer light, and I think that only an actor of DeNiro's caliber was capable of showing James Conway as the truly mean and vicious person he was in life. Henry Hill and his wife Karen are presented almost as victims and one could almost feel sorry for them. It's hard not to like Lorraine Bracco in any role she plays and I wish that they had cast someone not as likable as her as Mrs Hill. I, being involved in law enforcement for nearly twenty-five years saw them as criminals. The scenes depicted in the jails was as true to life as possible. I just feel that the way the criminals are made into heroes is a bad message to present to young people. More of the needless murder and suffering, the survivors family and loved ones left to pick up the pieces are neglected and ignored. Henry committing felonies on a daily basis, Karen living a glamorous life, and when they finally get caught and ready to be sent to jail, where they belong, become outstanding citizens by informing on their friends. Hill and his wife are no better than any of the others that committed felonies, condoned and participated in murder, robbery, assault, drug dealing and extortion. The flaw is that these characters are made to be sympathetic victims. It wasn't poor Henry's fault that for as long as he could remember he wanted to be a criminal. It wasn't Karen's fault that she felt all the glamour surrounding a life of extortion and theft. Her mother, presented as a mean interfering woman was another victim as was her father, presented as sickly and spineless. They truly suffered, seeing their daughter getting involved in a life with such trash. A message sent to young people that this type of life is fun, great and carefree is not a good message. Lets face it, Hill continues to be a criminal, even if not on the same scale he still goes into stores and steals from the shelf and we, the general public,  have to make up for the vendors lose because of this. Let's present the characters for what they are. Poor Tommy being murdered because he resented being shot by a mean coward. A man trying to make a living running a nightclub having his business being stolen or a poor mailman making his daily round sand being assaulted for doing what he was suppose to do, deliver the mail to the addressee and so many more depicted in the movie not as victims but as an occasional ship passing in the night and happening to be passing a barge filled with garbage. The movie is entertaining, but lets not forget that in real life these characters left a trail of victims and so much unnecessary hurt."
479610,False,"Well - here it goes.. In my area everyone ""loves"" the mob way of life.. Everyone loves ""The Sopranos"" and I also find it enjoyable to watch a great mob movie and then imagine for a minute that Im a part of it.. For most of my life there has been only one movie to even speak of when it came to this subject - The Godfather Epic. For those of you not familiar with it it was the Godfather Parts I and II edited in chronological order.. I've seen it several times and to this day my Dad still thinks that this is the best mob story ever told..But With all due respect..I just watched Goodfellas for the 12th time and - There is no doubt in my mind that Goodfellas is the best mob movie ever made..The story starts off during the Golden Age of Organizied Crime 1955 Brooklyn NY. A young Henry Hill is intrigued by the mob way of life - and let's be honest - why not !?.. They have it all - respect, wealth, and power.. Everything about the movie at this point is made to ""romance"" you about the era.. The music, the cinematography, work so well together..its quite rare that a film can make you actually ""feel"" a part of it.. Goodfellas succeeds at this.. We meet all sorts of characters who add to the environment. Henry as he learns the ropes also decribes to the viewer how it works.. And just about the time your ready to stand-up and declare you wanna be a ""wiseguy"" When things are going so good -Goodfellas smacks you right in the face and says - Whaddasamatta with you..The deceit, the lying, the overall evil that consumes these people is staggering.. The movie shows that in the mob there is no love, no loyality, no care - even amonst themselves.. The biggest mistake the mob made was to include drugs into its ""business"".Goodfellas exceeds the Godfather because of the feeling of inclusion you feel when watching it, it surrounds you and makes you feel like a part of the film.. I felt it's direction, and cinematography, and editing style are second to none.. This is Scorese and DeNiro's best film together..Raging Bull was great too but Casino was pale over this one -  Liotta was wonderful although he hasnt done much since.. and Pesci's best is My Cousin Vinny but his ""Tommy"" is very good - deserving of the Oscar that year - even though you wouldnt want to know him.If your a fan of mob storys in general see if you can spot two Sopranos guys in the movie ! Also look for Samuel L Jackson in a bit part.."
479611,False,"This movie was great, as most people comment, but what lacked was the ending.  It suddenly ended abruptly.  Kind of a let down, considering the way the rest of the movie went.  Great movie, I loved it, but the end was a little to sappy and feel good to be a true gangster classic.  By all means watch this movie.  I give would have given it a 9... but alas some times even the best things can let you down in the end -- 7"
479612,False,"I hadn't ever seen this one, save for parts on the idiot box, so I didn't quite know what to expect. To hear the critics drooling about GF, you'd think this was better than the first two Godfathers or Casino or whatever. Well I hate to burst anyone's bubble, but it's NOT. Its too long, Ray Liotta is OK but comes off having as much Mobster credibility onscreen as Potsy from 'Happy Days'. And I didn't feel bad for him one little bit when the Feds got him and his wife.The rest-DeNiro, Pesci, Sorvino-age some in this thing, which after all goes from c.53-the early 80s. But does Ray? Not from what I could see. I donno why that was, as he is about as babyfaced as Robbie Benson, its hard to tell how old the guy is, but I do know he should have shown some aging at least. Its almost as if he's stuck in the same age the whole film and watches the rest of the mob universe parade by.Watch this, then see Casino-you have basically the same movie, with DeNiro and Pesci trotting out the same old characters they have each played scads of times. Yeah you hear all about DeNiro's great versatility, but c'mon-Raging Bull this ain't. He was somewhat more refined in Casino than he was here, he shot more folks in Ronin, he was loonier in 'The Fan', but I think DeNiro's just mailing it in sometimes now. Pesci goes kookoo at the drop of a hat in this, I really despised the vile scene of him shooting the young kid waiter, and wonder what Scorsese was thinking when he put that in. Don't give me that 'its what these guys do in real life, its in character' crap-that is like the equally so-violent-its-stoopid aluminum baseball bats chorus that you get to see at the finale of Casino. Overkill is overkill, plain and simple.Pesci was better in JFK and Casino, but played the same kinda guy too, save in JFK Ferrie was, well....like his name sez.You get the same old Scorsese bag of tricks-his folks play some minor parts, the characters narrate the goings ons, the camera work is flashy, the Mob is alternately glorified then shown for what it is, the shootings, explosions and stabbings are filmed with bravado, skill and from many angles, jest in case you happened to miss them the first time. I get the feeling when seeing Casino or Goodfellas that I'm watching a guy with a PHD in Film School showing off to all us peons. And I'm not impressed. I have seen this all before.Lorraine Bracco was pretty good then kinda shelved as the film went on. Paul Sorvino was probably the best thing about the film, and he just trots out the same old 'Mean Paul' bit you can see in the 'Rocketeer' and 'Oh God', if you want my honest opinion.This film was Not better than Dancing With Wolves, and therefore, was Not unfairly passed over by Oscar, despite the rantings of its many Acolytes.Good movie? Sure. Great? Nahhh. Better than the Three Godfathers? Nope, save for maybe the IIIrd.*** outta ****; somewhat of a big 'So What' reaction by Gazzo-2 this time out."
479613,False,"before that I watch it I thought it is a masterpiece, but when I watched it I I understood that is not. it has a repetition story because The Godfather & Scarface told about corruption of power before. I gave it 6 stars because directing and performances are fantastic but the story....???!!!! runtime is 145 minutes but it seems 245 minutes.Scarface & The Godfather are about 170 minutes but they seem 120 minutes.that is for repetition story again. I forgot to say Joe Pesci was fantastic. I hope that fans of Goodfellas excuse me for this comment,this is mine"
479614,False,"Whats the best film by Martin Scorsese? Taxi Driver all the way.Okay, I will disagree with the popular and critic opinion that this is one of the best films ever, in fact, this is one of the worst films ever made. Why? Well, the acting is superb, the structure is superb as well, the cinematography is superb. In a technical sense, Goodfellas is one of the most well constructed and articulated films ever made. It truly grabs you by the neck and takes you on to a journey you will never forget.And that;'s why it is one of the worst films ever made: it is easy to make a pathetically bad film, such as ""Dude Where is My Car?"", it is not easy to make a film that makes you hate the entire cast of characters. The fact is that each one of the characters in this film is terrible: Tommy DeVito is among the most pathetic characters ever made: a guy who kills people due to his own insecurity. I wanted to see him suffer, but the film never let him suffer, that made me anxious!This is a great film, but not great in the good sense, its great in the bad sense. Hence, one of the worst film experiences I ever had."
