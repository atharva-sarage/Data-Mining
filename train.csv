7068,True,"I got to see The Dark Knight on Wednesday night, the reason though why I'm writing this movie comment this late is because I didn't wanna just jump and say this movie was awesome, I wanted to think it through, still today, I can't stop thinking about this movie! The Dark Knight lives up to it's hype and goes beyond it, this is the Batman movie that goes where no other Batman movie has gone before. It gave us a real sold story, we are finally told why the villains are the way they are, how all the injustice in the world can get underneath Batman's skin, how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on Earth. Heath Ledger, I absolutely loved Jack Nicolson's performance in the 1989 film, when I first read that Heath was signed onto The Dark Knight, I was like ""What are they, kidding?"", once you see The Dark Knight... Heath was incredible! I'm not going to compare Jack and Heath's performance, because they were two different versions of the Joker, but Heath's Joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. You didn't know what he was going to do next, he was so crazy, he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character, and the worst part is not only that he's crazy, he's driving Gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control, and guess what, he is doing it so well with a smile on his face. This was so much more than a Batman film, this was so much more than a comic book film, The Dark Knight truly delivers with drama, action, romance, horror, dark humor, the study of a psychopathic killer, a detective story. The force behind this epic movie is Christopher Nolan, who's previous film, Batman Begins, didn't really thrill me, but his incredible film making is truly shown in The Dark Knight, the shots that he got of Gotham City were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city, part of the Batman story. One of the things that I absolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic book movie, you know it's not real, people don't dress up in costumes, and save the day, villains don't name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes, but The Dark Knight actually makes it seem incredibly real, like it could happen.Bruce Wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of Batman and himself, he has lost Rachel to the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, he's inspiring others who are dressing up as Batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. But things are much worse when the Joker waltzes into town, and he's going to bring Hell upon Gotham City. Constantly playing with Gotham's mind and trying to get Batman to reveal himself, Batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. The Joker has named himself as the ""Classy Villain that Gotham needs"", he also has brought a new thought into Batman's head of them actually being more alike than different, that Batman completes him, the Joker would be nothing without him. But Batman is relying on Harvey Dent, who is Gotham's ""White Knight"" trying to put all of Gotham's scum in jail. But when the Joker plays Batman and Commissioner Gordon, Harvey and Rachel find themselves in very horrific position and Harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.All the performances are dead on in this movie, now everyone's going crazy over Heath Ledger's performance, but one performance I would also love to credit is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two Face, his performance was just as great as Heath's and made Two Face a human villain. You could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became Two Face. I know that everyone is saying this but I truly mean when I say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. We had some great movies these past few years, but I think The Dark Knight is seriously something special, but I don't wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. In my opinion though this is not a great movie, I can't come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was, to be honest I would go above a 10 rating if I could; this is the Batman film that we have been waiting for. I've seen it twice in one weekend, I'm going to see it three times this upcoming week, I don't mind one bit. I can't wait for the sequel and I would just like to say RIP to Heath, wish he could have seen his breath taking performance as The Joker.10/10"
7069,True,"I must say I was excited for this movie since the instant BATMAN BEGINS appeared on screen at the end of the first film. It was always going to be good, and sadly, it was always going to be over-hyped by the advertising warhorses.It is rare though, that a movie can surpass all the hype and pass all expectations on the film. Nolan (The Prestige, Begins) delivers on more than the Joker we remember from the 'Old Days' of Burton and Nicholson. Instead we're given a psychopathic sadist who pleasures from sheer anarchy.All the hailing of Ledger's performance are grounded. Watching it will make you feel a different chill down your spine than you'd remember from any other film. It's impossible, quite literally to relate to The Joker. He gets inside your head with his stories of how he got his scars, makes you laugh at his sick jokes, then makes you instantly wonder why you're laughing.If Ledger wasn't enough to horrify you - wait for Harvey Dent. Brilliantly portrayed by Aaron Eckhart as Gotham's 'fallen White Knight' and Batman's direct counterpart. His transformation will put Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal look like children's breakfast cartoons. Gyllenhaal had perfect chemistry with both Bale and Eckhart, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman both work well as Batman's 'conscience' and of course, Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon were all solid.There are some major differences between The Dark Knight and Begins. Firstly, the music is extremely disconcerted compared with the 'majestic but unfinished' tones of Begins - but it suits the film's tone: Anarchy in every sense. There was a more solid singular villain (compared with the many in Begins) - but there was also a lot more henchmen in TDK. The martial art direction was faster and more efficient - as mentioned in the film, learning through experience.I was disappointed at the role of Scarecrow in this film, it just felt like a loose thread and wasn't quite closed up or explained, and the ending, while it wasn't what I expected (others have said that it was predictable, but for me it wasn't) was solid and suited the film well.All in all, this is a film that is quite close, if it isn't already, a masterpiece. Nolan has a great thing going and unlike previous 'Superhero' adaptations (Spiderman and Fantastic Four for example), there isn't campiness creeping in. In face, if Batman Begins was 10/10, The Dark Knight deserves a 12. Quite simply, the best possible sequel that could've been given.If you watch this (which I implore that you do), you certainly won't regret it. One of the best movies of 2008 (I'll wait till Quantum of Solace comes out before I pass judgement) - but certainly a film worth getting excited for. If you don't like it, then that's also fine - but keep in mind that you probably thought Meet The Spartans was a good movie, so the rest of us won't take it to heart.Stunning in every aspect, and exceeds all hype and expectation... Can't wait to watch it again, or for the Blu-Ray!"
7070,True,"I thought Batman Begins was a very well conceived and put together  movie. We finally get Batman as a fully rendered character. We gain new  insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in  his role as protector of Gotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an  honest-to-goodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting  perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet.  But after seeing The Dark Knight, Batman Begins will forevermore be  viewed (by me at least) as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN'  MASTERPIECE of a superhero film.  To say it's the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would  be akin to calling the Nolan/Ledger Joker 'a bit eccentric'.  While watching it, I found myself thinking it was very long, which is  usually a sign that it's TOO long, and therefore boring. But that's not  actually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas, philosophical  musings, THEMES, which Christopher Nolan is not content to gloss over  in favour of cool set-pieces (as many comic adaptations are), but wants  to explore, wants to allow the characters to explore, at a logical  pace. So, what I guess I'm saying is, considering what it sets out to  do, the movie is long ENOUGH, while still constantly holding the  viewer's interest.  And that's not to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of  big action, either. On the contrary, there is some truly awesome stuff  going on here. The chase with the truck, for example, is fantastic, and  there's some great hand-to-hand stuff too.  But what engages us most is the characters, and, while the script is  brilliant (the dialogue is sharp, and quite funny for the first  two-thirds, before the drama really kicks in), this mainly comes down  to the cast.  Christian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val  Kilmer was. Less like Adam West than George Clooney was. Solid and  committed as always. He gives the character LIFE, and actually makes us  feel for him. The word 'tortured' keeps coming to mind...and I suppose  it's pretty appropriate.  Heath Ledger. Y'know, I'd heard talk of an Oscar nomination, and  thought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain? Winning an Oscar?  Is that what it's come to? Then I thought, is it because he didn't get  one for Brokeback? Or more dubious still...is it because he...died?  But...well...how can I put it...?   It seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero,  but after seeing Heath at work...Jack (who once seemed so awesome) just  looks...well...lame.  If you've seen it, you hopefully get what I mean. If you haven't...you  need to. You will discover the true definition of commitment.  Maggie Gyllenhaal. I didn't have any problem with Katie in the first  one (at the time), but I doubt she could have pulled off the more  emotional stuff Rachel goes through here. Seeing recasting was  necessary (does Tom have a problem with his wife being involved with  Batman? Too many bad memories perhaps? Why am I even talking about such  garbage here?) they could have done a butt-load worse than Maggie. She  rocks.  As does Aaron Eckhart. But I'm not giving ANYTHING away. Suffice it to  say my mind was blown...AGAIN. Makes Tommy Lee Jones look like...you  get the idea.  Michael Caine. Still one of my favourite actors. Alfred is the shiz.  Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK.  Gary Oldman. As in BB, no mania. No psychosis. No nervous tics.  Absolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian, Heath  and Aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular  talent. Go Gaz.  Eric Roberts! William Fichtner! Michael Jai White! Tiny Lister!  The whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful, well-executed  entertainment. It's equal parts cerebral and visceral. Ideas and  action.  I've liked every Batman movie so far (okay, besides Batman & Robin),  but this one makes them all look pretty bloody ordinary."
7071,True,"I think the big question...or the question everyone actually cares about is this: Is Christopher Nolan's follow up to the critically acclaimed 2005 film ""Batman Begins,"" The Dark Knight, as good as everyone is saying? Quite simply, yes, yes it is. There is no doubt about it, one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. This is no ordinary superhero movie, this is a character and dialogue driven piece, not as action orientated as you might expect.I will not go into plot details, because there is a lot of it. However, a basic one sentence summary is: Batman now has to face his most cunning and psychotic enemy, someone with no real motives...The Joker. Now that that is out of the way, I will start off with the actors (and boy, is there a lot to talk about). Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our beloved Caped Crusader, with him already blowing everyone else out of water with ""Batman Begins."" Bruce Wayne has a flawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness and criminal. His perception of justice causes an emotional and personal shift, whether he is a wealthy businessman who fights crime in a gadget-riddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in Gotham City and decides to give the law-breakers a dose of their own medicine. Because of this, and Bale's tremendous acting, Bruce Wayne is justified, and we emphasise with Bale's flawed hero more than any of the other actors. If there ever was an excellent Batman, this is it. The theme of right and wrong is played well with his character here.Of course, I am sure you all want know if Heath Ledger was that good. And I can safely say that he most definitely was. Ledger's Joker is not only the best, but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. His performance is truly terrifying, chilling, brilliant; any synonyms of the previous adjectives. Every scene he is in is stolen. The Joker truly is Batman's worst villain; cunning and psychotic, nothing quite matches his laugh and sinister makeup. If Ledger nabs the Oscar for Best Actor, I honestly will not be surprised. It is a true tragedy to see such a talented actor fall at such a young age...All the other actors cannot be forgotten, though. Aaron Eckhart has definitely proved himself previously (""Thankyou for Smoking"") as someone to watch out for. Here, as Harvey Dent (and later Two Face) he is very powerful. All he wants is justice; to bring down every single criminal. Eckhart is the definitive Two Face. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Wayne and Dent's love interest, Rachel Dawes is much better than Katie Holmes. Gyllenhaal's performance has substance, I really cared for her and her future and she was terrific in every scene. Michael Caine can do no wrong, and as Alfred Pennyworth he provides some comical and emotional scenes. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, although a limited role, does inject some sly humour and much needed morals into the story. Finally, Gary Oldman's Lt. James Gordon is riveting. He at least needs a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as another crime-fighting hero who faces some challenging situations.Wally Pfister's cinematography is simply stunning. Gotham has never looked so good, so big and deep. His wide shots purvey a dirty aura and contribute to the feel of the film. Without it, it may not have been the same. Another Oscar worthy portion, THE MUSIC! With Hans Zimmer AND James Newton Howard at the helm, how could it go wrong? The score sets the mood in every scene, giving an epic and thrilling tone. During the action sequences it really ups the adrenaline. And on the topic of action, The Dark Knight succeeds in having the best fight sequences and car chases in a comic book adaptation yet. With no obvious or over-use of CGI, the explosions and accidents are the real deal. Thrilling, edge of your seat and violent, this is brutally awesome stuff.Nevertheless, none of this would be possible without Christopher Nolan, the man behind it all. Pairing up with the writer (and brother) Jonathon Nolan, the darkest Batman movie yet is the best, and the best so far this year. This does not feel like a comic book film, the dialogue and situations feel so realistic. And, it IS the script that drives this film. The dialogue is very, very well written and is the centre of the conflict and the movie.It may be bold to say this, but this is the best superhero film of all time. There are others that are magnificent (""Superman"" and ""X-Men"" are two examples) but this is the most complex, the most dark and the most spectacular and epic of them all. See it for Bale, for Ledger, for the music, the action and for Nolan's flawless direction.5/5 and the best film of 2008 so far!!"
7072,True,"(Synopsis) Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) continues to eliminate crime in Gotham City with the help of Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). The Dark Knight wants to finally get rid of organized crime for good and be free of their corruption. Batman soon finds that a new psychopathic mastermind known as the Joker (Heath Ledger) has taken over organized crime. The Joker's plan is to terrify the citizens and throw the city into chaos, and kill Batman. Batman takes the fight with the Joker personal, which makes him confront his own beliefs. The Joker is the most dangerous criminal that Batman has encountered, and he will need all his strength and vigilance to defeat him.(My Comment) This film just blew me away. Christian Bale is a natural as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Michael Caine fits the part of Alfred, the trusted butler. Heath Ledger's performance as the sadistic Joker was absolutely disturbing and scary yet simply amazing. I would not want to meet the Joker in a dark alley, and whatever you do, don't ask him how he got his smile, especially, when he has a knife in his hand. Ledger's performance has turned the Joker into a new iconic movie villain image. Between all the punches, mayhem, and explosions, there is some good sinister dialog. The movie not only has a lot of action, it also tells the story of the internal struggle that Bruce Wayne is having with being the Batman hero. Bruce Wayne wants to be himself and maintain the difference between himself and Batman. Bruce must decide to follow the code or do what has to be done without affecting his own morals. The movie explores the literary themes of Hero verses Villain, as well as Order verses Anarchy, and the Joker explains to Batman that to have one you must have the other, and because of that, they will always be connected. The movie is long, but it went by so fast. You will love the last 45 minutes, because of the non-stop action with Batman in his new sonic suit and his BatPod. With all the explosions, body count, and the dark mood of the movie, I don't think parents should take young children. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 2:32, Rated PG-13)(10/10)"
7073,True,"Batman has always been my favourite superhero ever since the first time I heard about him because he his human with no powers, also he is much more questionable than any other superhero. The story of the film is about Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon, and new district attorney Harvey Dent beginning to succeed in rounding up the criminals that plague Gotham City. They are unexpectedly challenged when a mysterious criminal mastermind known as the Joker appears in Gotham. Batman's struggle against the Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to ""confront everything he believes"" and to improve his technology (which introduces the recreation of the Batcycle, known as the Batpod and the Batsuit was redesigned) to stop the madman's campaign of destruction. During the course of the film, a love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent and Rachel Dawes.There are now six Batman films and I must say that The Dark Knight is the best out of all of them. The title is good because that is what Batman actually is. It has been 3 years for the adventure to continue from Batman Begins but that entire wait was worth it. Gotham city is very Gothic looking and is very haunting and visionary. The whole movie is charged with pulse-pounding suspense, ingenious special effects and riveting performances from a first-rate cast especially from Heath Ledger who gave an Oscar nomination performance for best supporting-actor. It is a shame that he can't see his terrific work on-screen. The cinematography is excellent which is made so dark & sinister that really did suit the mood for the film. Usually sequels don't turn out to be better than the original but The Dark Knight is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original like The Godfather 2. I also really liked the poster where the building is on fire in a Bat symbol & Batman is standing in front of it. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director and his film Memento is one of my most favourite films. He hasn't made 10 movies yet and 3 of them are already on the IMDb top 250. Overall The Dark Knight is the kind of movie that will make the audience cheer in the end instead of throwing fruit & vegetables on the screen."
7074,True,"I have just come out of the ""Dark Curtain"" Screening for The Dark Knight in Adelaide, and I'm blown away.Nolan's directing is sublime, the pacing of the movie was so well kept, managing to keep the audience enthralled in an almost 3 hour movie. There were several shots in the film that had me saying ""Now how in the hell did they do that?!"", Brilliant scores by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer. Every actor shines, no one person steals the film. I don't want to say much about it, because whatever is said cannot do it justice, there is enough hype surrounding it's release, but it's there for a reason. Top Notch film. Bravo to Nolan and his crew for giving a movie that Batman truly deserves.9/10."
7075,True,"** PLOT SPOILERS EVERYWHERE ** Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is one of the better films in the history of its genre, however, it does not qualify as a masterpiece. In fact, it's quite far from such a distinction. It falls short of unquestionable excellence because of a ridiculously high number of plot holes, most of which regard The Joker and his criminal exploits.It is a given that Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker leaves us with a character who is thoughtful, unpredictable, ruthless, unrelenting, and arguably insane. That is to say, some inconsistencies in the villain should be accepted, if not embraced. But others, to be frank, are unacceptable because of their stupidity. For example: In the film's opening sequence, a clever bank heist spearheaded by The Joker, the crazed clown kills off his partners as the caper progresses. At the time, it made sense. Pretty simple, the more colleagues he kills off, the more money that leaves for him. But later on in the film, The Joker burns his half of the criminal underworld's combined fortune. He makes it overtly clear that he is not motivated by money. Not in the least bit.So why was the money a factor in the opening scene? It shouldn't have been. Uneven scripting there.But that's nitpicking in comparison to the film's greater faults. The ultimate reason why ""The Dark Knight"" falls short of the masterpiece label is because there is absolutely no way, under any circumstances, at any time, on any planet or in any solar system, that The Joker could execute so many complex plans in such a short period of time.OK, here is where people start saying: ""But it's a movie! It doesn't have to be possible."" I know, thanks. I agree, it doesn't have to be possible. But, and this is a huge BUT, a film as ambitious and lengthy as ""The Dark Knight"" wants to be taken seriously. Not only does it want to be taken seriously, I think director Christopher Nolan wants Oscar consideration for the work he has put in here, and cast members have been saying regularly that they don't want this to be considered as a mere ""superhero movie,"" or ""action movie."" Well if you want to elevate to the level of serious drama, then you have to explain a few things to me.(1) How does The Joker continue to find willing participants in his escapades when all of his previous crew members end up dead or in jail? The guys he's finding to work for him have to be true idiots. Totally brainless. And that doesn't work because The Joker's plans are meticulous and require precise timing and execution. If these goons are dumb enough to work for him, they aren't smart enough to be effective as help. It's a perpetual contradiction throughout the film, particularly the second act.(2) Sure The Joker is swift and tricky, but c'mon, he doesn't exactly look like a normal citizen. If city-wide security has been heightened to a level never before seen, how the hell is this maniac with a painted face and wacky hair not being spotted? Does he have an invisible transportation machine or something? He doesn't have supernatural powers, so he shouldn't have a supernatural aura.(3) When did he have the time to wire the hospital with bombs? Even if one of his goons did it, how did no one in the hospital notice suspicious activity? What about the assassination attempt on the Mayor? The other cops on the firing line didn't notice the most infamous villain in the city standing right next to them? Why? Because he crouched over a little and tried not to make eye contact with them? Please. I could go on for days, too many plot liberties were taken.I'd actually like to discuss the performances a bit. I think the separation between the strongest part and the rest of the cast is the largest ever with an ensemble of this size and magnitude. Meaning, Heath Ledger's performance was far and away the best in this film, better to the point where it bothered me that no one else was in his realm. The scenes where Ledger was off screen lacked the magnetism and intrigue of the ones in which he appeared. Although appeared is probably not the best word, more like dominated. Christian Bale was OK as Batman, but he's almost too stoic for a character with such strong morals and opinions. He's also a little bit stiff when he's in playboy mode as Bruce Wayne. I think his performance in ""The Prestige"" was more emotional, effective, and polished.Aaron Eckhart was all right as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, but the problem was that the vast majority of the time I was seeing Eckhart on screen, not Dent. The same Eckhart we saw in ""Thank You For Smoking."" Also, a man with a finely tuned social philosophy, like Dent, would not totally flip his ideology after the loss of a close loved one. Hopefully the angle is that the toxin causing the disfigurement messed more with his brain than we were led on to believe.Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman were believable as always, but of course they are underused as Alfred and Lucius Fox. Gary Oldman probably contributed the second strongest performance in the film as Commissioner Gordon, and Maggie Gyllenhaal (as Rachel Dawes) was a step up from Katie Holmes as far as execution and timing -- but that's not saying much. I really could go on for days about the unacceptable plot liberties, but I'll spare you. All in all, I liked the film because it had some thought-provoking sequences involving moral dilemmas and intriguing societal questions, and in having such ""The Dark Knight"" succeeded in escaping the ""superhero movie"" label. But it's not a masterpiece.Plain and simply, it has too many holes."
7076,True,"This was the most hyped movie of the year and probably one of the most hyped movies ever. Even with the overhype I had to see Heath Ledger play the joker because the trailers looked awesome. So I finally paid my ticket and watched the movie.The movie starts off really strong, the opening scene was an absolute blast (literally). From that point on though I didn't feel the same action. The rest of the movie just seemed, drawn out and completely over the top. Honestly where did the joker find a rocket launcher in Gotham City? This movie was just too long and much of the dialogue was something that a kid writes in senior creative writing and thinks it's brilliant. Also the director did an excellent job of warping the joker from one place to the next, the joker must have had a helicopter or a really loyal taxi driver. One second he's here and the next he's on top of that building. Probably the last straw was when Morgan Freeman showed up. He turns around and the camera is at a low angle as if to show the arrival of Morgan Freeman the ultimate modern narrator who is now in every movie, an older version of Samuel L Jackson who is soft spoken. They kind of made up for it when Debo from Friday showed up as the scary convict on the boat.After sitting in my seat for two and half hours as characters appeared and disappeared the movie finally ended, and it ended in a very cliché way. Way to say the title of the movie as the last word in the film, thats never been done ever?and The Dark Knight had to include the bain of every modern movie, being able to track people's cell phone calls. This little gimmick is in way too many movie these days.so ya I sat there for two and a half house and my butt really hurt, I wasted ten dollars on a cool movie, but one that wasn't as good as people claimed. Maybe next time Christian Bale will take some cough drops before showing up on set."
7077,True,"I completely fail to see how this movie could be considered, even at such an early stage 'The greatest movie of all time'!Heath Ledger is pretty good in it, but not that good. It is a good performance, but essentially he is just playing a pretty generic psychotic role in the mantle of the joker. Christian Bale is completely wooden in his role as Bruce Wayne, Batman is a minor character. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are there to lend credibility, but do very little. Aaron Eckhardt plays the rather bland Harvey Dent, but again, not a terrific performance.This is a ridiculous movie, based upon a ridiculous concept that takes itself so seriously that I found it painful to watch. The script is in parts cringe worthy. The plot is incoherent, there are no real character arcs, save for Harvey Dent's and it is very poorly executed. The 'sonar imaging' using Gotham's 30 million mobile phones was a real jump the shark moment.The violence is extreme, especially when you consider Batman is essentially a children's comic. The movie revels in sadism and extreme violence, shame on Christopher Nolan for the glorification of this.The art direction extends to a few Batman gadgets and some lo-fi emo make up on the Joker. No effort whatsoever was made to show Gotham as anything other than a generic American city.Glaring plot holes abound, from dogs chewing through the bat-suit where as bullets have no effect to Joker somehow being able to blow up an entire hospital despite giving prior warning! Joker describes himself as an 'agent of chaos' who just does random things, yet everything he does is meticulously planned. The joker has no real sense of humour, he rarely ever smiles which is a total deviation from the comic character.This film - for me personally - signifies the death of the blockbuster. It might have made a vast amount of money at the box office, but i sets out to appeal to the lowest common denominator.The Dark Knight is a humourless, negative, sadistic movie with no substance to it, a weak script, which as one reviewer pointed out that for all the pseudo-intellectual monologues and pseudo- philosophical rambling just ended up with someone getting punched or shot.An immature film that should be for kids, but was really made for adults.I don't want to see it again, it was a waste of time. This is film as junk food, it is bad for the soul."
7078,True,"The Dark Knight maintained the intensity and overall gunmetal grayish feel that sets this Batman apart. The film takes us to a Gotham City that has grown accustomed to the big bat's crime-fighting crusades, and the last remaining big time criminals have actually grown fearful of his wrath. They form an alliance to attempt to keep their illicit business activities alive but are feeling even more pressure from yet a different angle: the passionate and fearless new district attorney, Harvey Dent. Recognizing the crime group's looming extinction, a stranger enters their circle and offers what he thinks is the only solution: kill Batman.The bad guys don't know if they can trust this seemingly demented madman, and they later learn the hard way that they don't really have a choice, for the most disturbing part of the Joker's personality is his motive. He doesn't care about money or power. He just enjoys causing trouble and watching, with pleasure, from the sidelines, as the terrorized city scrambles in mayhem...which leads me to the real star of this film, Heath Ledger.Ledger's performance as the Joker is astounding and consuming. We come face-to-face with a villain bearing the coldness of a psychopath and a personality that remains as mysterious and inexplicable as the real reason for the scars on his face. He develops the air of the lone offender quite early on as he nonchalantly kills those who help him commit his crimes. Yet, he has no problem building an army of followers, and the viewers easily find that believable. As insane as he is, he's focused and quite determined. Ledger also brings the Joker's humor to the role, but he does it in a way that is unique to this interpretation...with subtlety and honesty. The very words and mannerisms that made me laugh also evoked feelings of sadness in its clarity. The evil is incredibly convincing.Although Batman is a character that is often marketed towards kids, this film is definitely not appropriate for young children. In addition to the dark images, the violence, both seen and implied, is sometimes unsettling, and Ledger's Joker is chilling even for adult viewers. Having said that, this is, by far, one of the best films I've ever seen, and it will easily find a place in my personal top ten. I am only disappointed that this Joker, the best villain in a film since Hannibal Lecter, will never be revealed to us again."
7079,True,"I'm very disappointed and this rating reflects my disappointment. It could have been so much better, easily. First, it's as if there's no obstacles the characters couldn't overcome by snapping their fingers. It's just too easy for the Joker and Batman to do all what they do. It seems the writers didn't want to be bothered by realism and it's one of the main reasons I didn't feel involved or excited at all. Batman pulls out technological rabbits out of his hat to move the plot forward - it's contrived and not entertaining. The Joker sets bombs anywhere he wants without facing any obstacles. His team of super terrorists can fill a whole hospital with explosives in a few minutes after it has been evacuated - or was it before? Anyway we don't see them setting up anything, everything is done off-screen and it goes into action without any kind of dramatic buildup. How did his gang do this or that? Doesn't matter cause there's an explosion coming soon. *YAWN* The Joker starts with a small gang but in only a few days or so it seems he builds a big organization capable of operating rapidly without flaws - a group we are told made up of many schizos and psychos from Arkham Asylum, as if they had all been released all of a sudden to join him and moreover in doing so became hyperobedient and hypercompetent robbers / explosive experts / terrorists / etc. Yeah. Right. As if running a criminal organization made up of Arkham inmates would be a piece of cake. It would have been so much more REALISTIC and ENTERTAINING to see the Joker having to deal with nutty and sometimes incompetent henchmen and we the viewers doubting whether or not he would succeed and yet pulling it off and laughing all the way up to the last confrontation. Instead he surfs on the action, survives all kinds of explosions and crashes and moves around as if Gotham City was butter and he a hot knife. *YAWN* Second, the style & editing of the movie was mediocre at best. You would think the Joker's first meeting with the mob would have something of a tension. Here we are introduced to Batman's no.1 enemy and he tells them they have to kill the Dark Knight. But the way it was shot the scene was cold, he simply goes in, makes a few enemies and leaves. And next The Joker invites himself to Bruce Wayne's party to kidnap Harvey Dent and he simply comes in, Voilà!, without facing any obstacles, there's no buildup, no dramatic crescendo, the pace stays the same, we get lots of quick shots, a constantly moving camera and even one or two 360 degrees around Joker and Rachel as if this was some kind of music video. There's nothing, no tension. And it went downhill from there, like a typical dumb action movie. Explosion, car chase, car chase, explosion, fight, car chase, explosion. Can't you guys come up with something original? And those action scenes aren't even well made. *YAWN* Why? After all you had an ace, The Joker, he should have had some cool crazy ideas to cause mayhem... but he didn't. He lacked the charisma that should be in such a character. Not that Ledger is bad but the character he plays has nothing special. He's cold, predictable and not funny. In Tim Burton's movie the man isn't just some psycho killer, you know early in the movie he's going to do his crimes with style and that he has surprises in his bag. He's a bit silly but you don't know what to expect from him - he's fun to watch. In TDK he neither has style nor surprises, HE JUST BLOWS THINGS UP WITH DETONATORS and he's not even having fun. Bbbooorrriiiinnnggg.I think a lot of people don't see all the big flaws of the movie because they like the characters and the themes. I like Batman, the lone vigilante fighting crime in his city and his struggle to retain his morality while confronting the worst criminals, I like Harvey Dent's character and the Joker trying to turn Dent into a madman like him to ruin his crusade against crime and I liked the Joker trying to corrupt the people of Gotham and turn them into murderers ...BUT THE MOVIE SU CKS I really wanted TDK to be good, good at least like half of Batman Begins is, I wanted to leave the theater with a big smile on my face but I left the theater feeling cheated because I wanted to see a cool movie and I didn't, I saw a lame piece of crap. There was no climax, no great scenes, no drama, no tension, no substance, only over the top action scenes we have already seen elsewhere. This movie itself isn't a 1 out of 10 but I'm so disappointed by it that it deserves its 1"
7080,True,"Wow. Once again my faith in the rational persons ability to discriminate between depth and breadth, is verified, in that I have none.The film was long. Not deep. I think there is a misunderstanding. The film had the veneer of an epic film. It had all the right elements to be an epic comic-book adaptation to screen. Yet it faltered, mainly because everyone was so wrapped up in the idea of Ledger giving a career defining performance, they couldn't see past it. It's almost as if they accepted the brilliance of his performance before they entered the theatre, off of the back of the hype and the critics reviews, and all that was left was to actually watch it and be able to validate this belief.Disregarding Heath Ledgers untimely death, can you really say that he was a better Joker than Jack Nicholsons? I for one, cannot. Others have already said it; he had no back story. A character without a past and a motive - especially when they are a killer - is just not one that is appropriate to a story about good and evil. The things we like about villains is that we can relate to the reasons they do the things they do, whilst asking ourselves whether their reasons are justified. We get into a dialogue, and we ourselves get to decide who we side with - the good or the bad. This villain left me feeling flat and unfulfilled because he had no real motive, - making it impossible to choose which argument, good or bad, I sided with - and left me feeling like I was a voyeur, watching a guy kill loads of people.Everyone has been raving about the script, which I thought was plain dreadful at points. Others have raised the questions here. What was with his voice? He would make a great nursery nurse. The poignant moment on the boat when the sailor said something to the effect of ""They haven't pushed the button yet, because we are still alive"" was just plain embarrassing. The fact that Batman kept leaving in the middle of a conversation became irritating instead of cool and enigmatic. Why can't he just hear someone out. And at the end when batman runs home like Charlie, I was nearly dying in laughter. I could hear the music 'I've got a golden ticket'. There were other embarrassing script moments, but because the film was so bad, I can't even be bothered to mention them. The phone device for one was utter...The rhetoric of the characters in their oratorical moments was again, limp. It was as if the writer had started a sadistic, flowing evil speech, but had not had the tools with which to really elaborate. Because he had decided to keep the Jokers background exclusive, the speeches were neither funny or scary. They were punctured and lacked conviction.The fact that this is the number one movie is embarrassing. IMDb should take it off out of principle. If this wins an Oscar, I will never watch a Hollywood movie again."
7081,True,"Obviously Christopher Nolan was trying to touch on one of the prominent issues of recent times. That of the environment. He did this by recycling tired old jokes and set pieces from many action films before, and the rest of the plot was salvaged from toilets and rubbish bins. He also comes up with the perfect formula to make a profound sentence, by taking two words that mean complete opposites and shoving them together.Joking aside, after almost nodding off for the first hour and a half the second half of the movie actually was pretty good, albeit drawn out until the ending which was very frustrating. They literally left the joker hanging while dealing with the completely pointless and irrational side-story of two-face. I'd have thought that a man of dent's resolve would have been made stronger by the events that took place, to get back at the joker and stop such events from happening to other people, instead of deteriorating into the monster of similar calibre to the joker.I really don't think the film got the best out of the actors involved, probably due to the script. Christian Bale is a fantastic actor, but he is completely wasted as batman where he spends most of his time jumping about in a bat-suit using a silly voice, instead of displaying his incredible character acting skills in movies such as American Psycho and the Machinist. Heath Ledger's performance was the only real solid one in the entire cast, however at plenty of times he guilty of completely over-acting. His introduction to the members of the mob was farcical and the laughter in the cinemas was due to the awkwardness and stupidity of the situation.The main reason I think the film totally fails is Christopher Nolans approach of trying to make the film really realistic with an explanation for everything. A man running around in a bat costume and a man dressed up in clown make-up is just to surreal to try and be addressed in this manner. This is why I think the original Batman is a lot better because it didn't try to be ultra-realistic and took the comics and had a fairly serious tone with a very comedic undercurrent. Christopher Nolan undoubtedly has talent as a director, memento, the prestige and even insomnia are all great films but I feel his attempts at the batman franchise are far outshone by Tim Burton.Obviously the film is already a hit and there is nothing anyone can write to stop it from being so, however I must implore you to actually watch the film critically and realise its shortcomings, than get swept away in the hype."
7082,True,"I settled on a 5/10 for The Dark Knight. I appreciated the story structure and all the notes they hit... I just don't think they played them loudly. I don't like re-casting, and the replacement of Katie Holmes/Rachel and the original Barbara Gordon actress (yes, her too, didya notice?) is awkward and distracting. The lack of ANY blood in the film to complement the multitude of beatings and killings (to sustain a PG-13 rating) nullifies the tension that should be present in some brilliantly conceived scenarios. I didn't believe for a second that the victims of several hostage situations (mass or otherwise) would actually lose their lives, because it's blisteringly apparent from the onset that this film is a PG-13, and would never disturb its audience beyond the minimum necessary plot points. The Joker is actually underwritten. Ledger was game and his performance solid, but honestly: Throw the makeup and stringy hair on 75% of capable actors out there, and you have the same product. I think Jack Nicholson's output is ultimately more interesting, and I think that Tim Burton's original film, although imperfect, is still the most entertaining in the pantheon.I realize that to hardcore Batman fans, this is a wet dream having the grittiness of the graphic novels transposed to the big screen (if they say so; I say it came close), but riddle me this: If the same script was fashioned into a non-superhero flick, let's say Heat II, and had the same strong performances and production values, would the lack of Batman fan loyalty still rocket it to its current position on the IMDb Top 250?"
7083,True,"There is nothing special about this movie. Period. Nothiing special. It tries on so many levels to be this big mega movie, and in financial terms, it was, but you know what? It's still not good, no matter how many fans it has, no matter how much money it pulls in. Those are just figures and numbers, and they're quite boring in the long run. Let's go over a few reasons why it was not good. First off, the story bites off way more than is necessary. We have Bruce Wayne in this ridiculous attempt to win back a woman he'll never have the chance to be with. The woman he is in love with prances around like a little school girl, and really has no business being in the story to begin with. She is just there to make both Batman and Harvey Dent rival each other. I'm so sure that the writers could have come up with a better plan to pit the two against each other than that. Then, there's the Joker...the most ridiculous part of the story. Ridiculous because of the lengths and the means that the filmmakers took to bring a new kind of villain. It's not entertaining, it's not disturbing, it's just sick. This movie was not fun. It was not entertaining. It was a product for the mindless audiences who were going to buy into it anyway, and especially because of the death of Heath edger. Let's talk a little about that. This film had success that rode the curtail of Ledgers death. The studio deliberately used the poor suffering of a human being to push a film into exhibition. That's really sad, and you know what else? It's all this film will ever be...the last film of Heath Ledger, and America went to see it because he died before it's release. sad. Really sad. I didn't like it, and I bet others will not like me for that very reason. Even more sad still."
7084,True,"I know this review will get a bunch of unhelpful votes but somebody has to tell the truth here! The Dark Knight is wildly overrated and is the most overrated movie of all time. Forget Titanic, Boondock Saints and King Kong(2005). This movie surpasses them when it comes to sheer hype. For the record I love Batman Begins. I thought it was a fresh beginning on a series that was rendered ineffective by that lunatic Joel Schumacher. Christian Bale fared well as both Batman and Bruce Wayne and the rest of the cast did a great job also. But this movie.... Everything that made Batman Begins so great is absent from this pretentious slop. Most of the cast look like they'd rather be somewhere else. Let me break it down this way with what stinks about this movie.The plot: Idiotic beyond belief. Joker(Heath Ledger) plans to kill city officials while playing childish games with Batman. Most of the time he's killing the people he's aligned with making him the most moronic villain in superhero movie history. Batman joins forces with Commissioner Gordon to stop him.The acting: Christian Bale is wooden in both roles(Batman and Bruce Wayne). He spends most of the movie looking like he's stoned out of his mind. And what is up with that voice? In Batman Begins he sounded cool like one of the gangsters from those old 1940s flicks. Here he sounds like Dirty Harry with strep throat. Aaron Eckhart is flat as both Harvey Dent and Two-Face. While his Two-Face was better than Tommy Lee's Two-Face looking good by default is never good. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman sleepwalk through this whole movie. Maggie Gyllenhaal is quite awful as Rachel Dawes. Katie Holme's Rachel Dawes was a strong willed lawyer that fought for what's right. Maggie's Rachel Dawes needs to grow up and find some better priorities. I agree that she is a step up from Katie Holmes but she plays Rachel Dawes like some silly high school girl with a pathetic crush on Bruce Wayne. The fact that we are asked to feel sympathy for her when The Joker captures her is a bit of a stretch. Her getting roasted made my day though lol!Now for the talk of the town: Heath Ledger as Joker. Heath Ledger's performance was okay but to say that he was better than Jack Nicholson's Joker is hilarious to say the least. Jack Nicholson's Joker had style, a plan and was pretty funny as well as unpredictable. Of course he was silly but he was fun. Heath Ledger's Joker is predictable with no back story and had no real plan. Just random acts of chaos. Ra's Al Ghul had a plan, The Joker of Batman 1989 had a plan, The Penguin of Batman Returns had a plan. This weirdo had nothing but bluff. Plus he's has no fun with what he does and spends most of the time ridiculously philosophizing like those corny emo-goth kids that smoke copious amounts of cigarettes while yapping about the misery of their lives. You complete me? That's about as cheesy as the Tumbler turning into a crappy motorcycle. Speaking of Emo-Goth kids that exactly what this Joker is. Only people actually find him cool instead of pathetic.Action sequences: predictable to a fault. Car chase and fights scenes plus they are quite unrealistic. People get punched, kicked, shot, bitten by dogs and knocked around by explosions and walk away without bumps, bruises, cuts or blood. Now, Im not a gore hound but if you get shot or bitten by a dog, I would expect to see some blood. Not in the Dark Knight though. Pacing: The movie builds up a pace to slow it down after wards and with all the action on the screen the movie still finds time to be boring. Plus at 2 hours and 32 minutes this movie feels longer than it needs to be. Various subplots that never connect best describe most of this movie.Conclusion: The Dark Knight is the most overrated, most hypocritical, most pretentious piece of garbage in the history of cinema. The only people that would like this are the fanboys and I cant believe that people are trouncing Tim Burton's Batman movies to foam at the mouth like rabid dog groupies over this overcooked sequel. You pseudo-intellectual snobs don't seem to realize that those movies were great for the time they were made in and they were fun. Tim Burton made the type of Batman movie he wanted to make without trying to please these shills. I must have seen the Tim Burton Batman movies more times than I can count and still have a ball watching them till this day. I saw this dreck three times and still couldn't get into it. Its not even fun. Its a plodding mess that gets more hype than it deserves. Matter of fact, I'll tell how much I didn't like it. For months I had The Dark Knight on my computer for free via z-share and when my computer suffered from a virus that force me to erase the whole thing, this was the only movie through z-share that I never tried to get back. That should tell you everything you need to know about my feelings on this movie. Two Thumbs down."
7085,True,"Yes, Joker was really great, but overall this movie was a total letdown.A few totally stupid things that killed this movie for me.*Spoilers* Joker blows up a freaking HOSPITAL in BROAD freaking DAYLIGHT and makes his escape in an ultra fast SCHOOL BUS, which no cop seems able to stop, even though they've been warned that Joker will, you know, blow up a hospital. You see, this is totally believable because the cops apparently set up a perimeter two freaking miles away, just to be safe. It's not like they could have used a helicopter or something for surveillance. That would just make too much sense (sarcasm).Batman falls several stories to the ground, not once, but TWICE and gets up without so much as a broken bone, but hey, that's okay because his super duper special armor, (which is so strong that a dog can chew through it) protected him from the fall. That's totally realistic! Right? What's that you say? The metal roof of the Taxi totally cushioned his fall. Well, that's even BETTER! How wonderfully realistic. If I ever have to jump out of a burning building it's nice to know that a kevlar vest and a strategically placed car will break my fall.Police Commissioner Gordon pretends to be dead so that Joker will chase after Harvey Dent instead of his family (huh?) and Joker proceeds to kill six innocent people in the middle of downtown Chicago, uh, Gotham City, but this is okay, because by drawing the Joker out, the police are protecting the public from harm. No reason to clear the streets of pedestrians and traffic and stuff while transporting Harvey Dent as bait for a sicko maniac killer.Joker manages to keep a pencil perfectly balanced on a table while a large gangster stomps across the floor to fight him. Cool, but stupid.Joker burns a pyramid of money, because you see, money is not important to him. What's important to him is blowing and burning stuff up, which is exactly why he robs banks for a living. Makes perfect sense, no?Batman speaks with an annoying rasp which hides his Bruce Wayne voice because as everyone knows, Christopher Nolan wants this to be a REALISTIC depiction of Batman, which is why we have sonar cell phones in this movie and magic armor and explosive laced Bat Mobiles that turn into motorcycles which do gravity defying 360 turns on walls.Other complaints: There was no Wayne Manor in this film. No Bat cave. Chicago looks a bit too bright and modern to be Gotham City. Seriously, what is Gotham City without, you know, Gothic architecture? The girl playing Rachel Dawes is completely ugly, but for some reason Bruce Wayne is so obsessed with her that he decides to have sex with the whole Gotham City ballet, just so she can't go on a date with Harvey Dent.I know lots of people got drawn into the hype of seeing Heath Ledger's last great performance, but besides Joker, there is no redeeming value in this film. There's no iconic battles. No real hero to root for (seriously, you will hate Batman in this movie).Christopher Nolan gets a special mention for trying to inject at least some intelligence into a summer blockbuster, but there was just one too many stupid things to justify the price of admission. If you haven't seen this film, just wait for it on DVD."
7086,True,"There were just too many subplots, too much violence, and it was at least a half hour too long. They should have taken some of the time they spent planning CGI effects and used it to seal some of the plot holes: 1. A witness pulls a gun out while he's on the witness stand? Excuse me?? This is some mythic land where the courthouses don't have metal detectors? 2. There's a terrorist threat against a hospital, so they evacuate every patient--*except* the one who's been in all the papers.3. The police are transporting a high-profile prisoner, with dozens of vehicles escorting him and SWAT teams all over the place--but one trailer truck starts chasing them and they're all helpless.4. The silliest thing of all--Batman's constant whispering. It's supposed to make him sound menacing, but he just sounds like he has laryngitis. It's like the old Superman TV show where people magically have no idea who he is as long as he keeps his glasses on.I know I'm way in the minority on this one, but I have to say this was the ugliest, stupidest movie I've ever seen. I would have walked out if I weren't trapped at the end of an aisle. You couldn't pay me enough to sit through it again."
7087,True,"I don't think that in my quarter century of living I've ever felt more disconnected from the pop-culture at large than after seeing this movie. With all the hype and uniform praise I thought beforehand that this is at least a solid piece of cinematic craft, maybe embellished slightly by Heath Ledger's unexpected death.Unfortunately, this movie is rock solid proof that sometimes mass delusion can strike an entire society at one time. There is absolutely no way that this film can be regarded not just as a masterpiece, but even as half-way decent.Let's get to the point. First - the plot. It's just unconvincing as a whole. Batman is basically a side character with little to do as he takes backseat on the Joker train. He whines incessantly about how no one needs him and how he needs to hang up his cape. Do it already! His troubled relationship with Rachel Dawes has zero chemistry and it's hard to care about the outcome. The idea of Joker being an anarchist, goalless and malevolent force sounds good on paper, but it translates to aimlessness on the screen. Joker shows up out of nowhere seemingly with no one backing him and then... snap! It seems like the whole world is at his service. Not only he has no trouble hijacking a school bus (and then blending into a line of school buses after driving out of a half collapsed bank), hacking into the public TV feed or rigging an entire hospital with explosives; he apparently does it with such ease that the creators didn't feel the need to reveal a shred of information about how he did it. Many events in the movie make absolutely no sense whatsoever. For example - what was the purpose of Lt. Gordon faking his death? And why did they make a point of showing the scene where his family is informed of the death - was that just to get the audience to buy into it as well? That's just dumb and a waste of time. Why did Harvey Dent become evil all of a sudden? Sure he was badly burned, but he had to know the risks going into this business and he had a steely resolve just minutes prior. There are many other plot issues, but it's pointless listing them all. They are there and easy to spot.The acting in the movie is a-OK, but most of the actors just don't have any good lines as their characters are irrelevant puppets. Heath Ledger is good for sure, but his take on the character gets tedious after a while - mostly from overexposure. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a good actress, but she's just so wrong for the role. She's a nice-girl-next-door type and as superficial as it sounds, it's hard to believe that she would have two hotshots like Harvey Dent and Bruce Wayne chasing after her. Christian Bale has zero material to work with and they've turned Morgan Freeman into a moralizing nerd. Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart and especially Michael Caine do a decent job considering the script they were given to work with.The screenplay is atrocious, incongruent and messy. It's like the movie was cut-up into a thousand pieces of varying length, reshuffled and then strung together. There is no natural progression of events and subsequent scenes frequently befuddle. It takes a couple of minutes to figure out what the hell is going on or why should we care. It's just poorly done.For all the car chases, fight scenes, and giant explosions, the movie is just unforgivably boring. It's a combination stemming from a poor script, naive (or barely existent) plot, flat characters (that can't be remotely identified with much less loved or hated), and a general lack of good sense. There is also an annoying feeling that the creators had a rather low opinion of the viewers intelligence or maybe they just rushed the movie and had to come up with a lot of material in a little time, hence the low quality.Before I end this overlong diatribe, let me just mention three scenes that I absolutely cannot get over with in terms of their pointlessness and stupidity. 1. Batman is riding his wicked-cool motorcycle approaching an aftermath of a multi vehicle crash and accelerates aiming it straight at the Joker. What he is trying to accomplish is never explained. One thing certain is that at the last moment he veers right, barely avoiding the villain, and drives his bike without touching the brakes, straight into a wall. I mean he drives it into a wall (or overturned truck, can't remember) full speed like a blind man. Had he even chosen to hit the Joker, how the hell did he expect to stop? 2. This one actually occurs a couple of times at least. Batman leaps out of a 20th story window and falls onto the ground unharmed. Unharmed! He didn't have a parachute, a bungee cord, and he didn't even spread his cape on the way down. He just hit full blast and walked away. And on one occasion his squeeze Ms Dawes fell with him and experienced a similarly puzzling lack of after-effects. Filmmakers, needless to say, didn't find it prudent to even try to provide some explanation.3. Joker enters the hospital in a nurse uniform. That should present a logistical problem by itself, but OK. However, not only he seems to move around the hospital freely, he also does it still wearing his face paint. I mean the lower half his face is covered by a protective mask, but the rest is clearly visible. What's even funnier is that Harvey Dent looks at Joker straight in the eyes and the face paint doesn't give him away until he takes of the mask. Is this a cartoon?"
7088,True,"For a film to be 10/10, it really has to be almost perfect. I know it's all about opinions, but to get that rating it must be technically well made, you know, entertaining, good plot, special FX, acting, realism, etc. Oh and when I say realism I don't mean you cannot have superheroes or fantasy, but within the framework of the movie you have to follow its own rules. For example the Matrix was still realistic even though people could fly (it was set in a computer so it's possible). I liked the fact TDK was serious and dark, but that is where the positives end. The plot is ludicrous, as the Joker, who is a human being, is omnipresent, clairvoyant, a great hypnotist, invincible and has no human needs. I know this is a ""comic book"" movie, but when you set up a film in a normal America city, with normal physics and all that goes with it, you cannot then just make up a completely implausible story of events.The joker is beaten up, involved in car crashes, doesn't seem to sleep, yet is perfectly fine at all timesHas a vast amount of mindless, kamikaze, henchmen, who inexplicably do everything he says.The joker is able to accurately predict where everyone in Gotham will be at any time and able to somehow be in 20 places at once.No one notices the huge amounts of explosives placed in the hospital or the boats or any building in town for that matter. A man with a bomb and phone inside him is conveniently in the right place at the right time, somehow avoiding the police metal detectors or dying from his surgery.In the end the story is too unbelievable and too long as well. You don't care about anyone, as everything is too unrealistic. Therefore this film cannot ever be considered a 10/10, almost regardless of opinion. I quite liked the filming and the mood of the film, but it has too many flaws to be considered that good.I gave it a 1/10, which is too harsh, but I felt obligated to bring down the overall rating."
7089,True,"How can a film like this be ever compared to a film like the godfather is laughable, i am a big comic book and superhero fan i particularly like this genre but i did not like the way this was handled whatsoever..the following points highlight my case why batman is nothing but a okay film.. 1- CONCEPTION AND CREATION everyone knows that one of the most exciting things about villains is there creation, and how they became they way they are, i believe the original batman films which Tim Burton directed handled this brilliantly, but look at Spiderman 2 which has a great villain. There was no flashback even to the creation of the joker character we must believe he has been there all along, as well as Two Face whos original coming of being i liked better in batman forever, not to say i like tommy lee Jones character portrayal any better than this 1.2-VIOLENCE this film had left a bitter taste after viewing i am a fan of violent films but it can be seen the way this was edited to ensure the upper catorgory of a pg-13 12a(uk) over here left the film looking a feeling like something was missing. Instead of showing the conseqeunce of for example a bullet in the head the camera would cut away leaving it for the audience imagination, another example of not showing violence and actually changing the tone of the film was robocop the R rated version when compared against the X rated version which seems lighter in tone.3-BATMAN now Batman played by Bale one of my favourite actors opted for a stupid gruff sounding voice which didn't work, also the suit castes were terrible and i mean truly bad, batmans suit made him look like a more well equipped navy seal or something, not the true mysticism that is batman which is lost in this film. There is no reference to bats whatsoever throughout the duration. Another letdown was the fight sequences which even though Bale did a lot himself did not look smooth, or good on the big screen.4-PLOT/PACINGthe plot has to many twists and turns and leaves some of the less cerebral most likely lost(not myself of course). The pacing is bad as there is one key action sequence in the middle of the film which did blow me away but the film never lived up to that particular sequence which is a shame, less morality and preachyness more ACTION! and on that note a spoiler which i do warn before hand, the ending i must say i disliked a lot, for lack of realism, depth and completion as it is left very much open of what happens to the joker character, my 2 cents please reply if you have maybe a differing opinion to mine, Spiderman 2 is one of the greatest comic book translations to films, as in the earlier batmans, (including returns) but this should never be uttered in the same sentence as a film like the Godfather, which i believe to be one of the greatest of all time, the greatest which i do believe is Once upon A time in America."
7090,True,"OK I waited a really long time to actually see this movie.. mostly because of the hype.. I wanted to see if after all the long drawn out hype of Heath Ledger's death... its #1 spot on the IMDb boards.. and all the back and forth conversations on whether it or not it was the greatest film of all time... it could actually live up to that standing.The simple answer is no.1. Writing 6/10There are a lot of points in this film where the dialogue feels really rushed and just awkward. I don't understand why batman begins (which in my opinion far exceeds this film) could do everything right with the screenplay and this one fail so badly. The standard plot devices are there good/evil good as evil.. downfall of the hero.. redemption .. blah blah blah... its all been done before.. and I might add done much better. One quick film which comes to mind.. ""There will be blood"" used a very similar thesis of the antihero but did in a much more intelligent and beautiful way. 2. Visuals 7/10Yes there are a lot of very impressive effects in this movie.. the tractor flipping being one.. and the whole opening sequence.. but again where have we not seen any of this before in a michael bay project or hell even the die hard movies? There is no signature to the cinematography and nothing which sets it apart from any other big budget Hollywood movie. Id say the most stand out moment of the entire thing was seeing harvey dent's face after the accident.3. Characters 2/10OK if hear a Batman talk like that again I swear im going to walk out of the theatre, What a horrible horrible disaster . Christian Bale sounded like he had one of his batarangs stuck in his throat. I don't know who decided on this plot device but it was a mistake. I don't remember any of this in Batman Begins and imo it really brought the project as a whole down. Heath Ledger was OK. Whenever an actor passes away prior to the release of his film of course there will be a strong tendency to have a biased opinion to how great he was. It really felt like he was overdoing it. If he took his acting down a notch I think his vision of the joker would have been much more believable. And possibly shooed him in for an Oscar nod. About the only really believable character in the film was Gary Oldman's ""Jim Gordon"" But than again anything he does his great.4. Overall 5/10A good action movie... But seriously overrated. 007 in a Bat Costume. PS#4 currently on the IMDb top100? Someone's getting paid."
7091,True,"This was one of the worst movies ever made. Never before have I witnessed a more confusing and convoluted mess. There were about ten subplots, but there was no main plot. The Joker existed to run amok and to represent the ""honest villain"", that is, he didn't mess around and play games like most villains, and he didn't do it for money, he just killed and wreaked havoc for the heck of it... okay, that's fine. But in having the Joker purposely ruin all the other subplots involving other bad guys, it basically made all the energy in having to keep up with the subplots involving these other people come to nothing. It was very tiresome realizing that everything you witnessed, after two hours of non-story action and hammy performances, really didn't mean a thing, kind of like when a movie shows that ""it's all a dream"". It might as well have been a dream. Because in this complete mess of a film, nothing mattered. The Joker had no purpose - which was intentional. But since the rest of the movie had too much purpose, or rather, tried too hard to have all the purpose in the world - it all came together like a big explosion... then, nothing. Just ruins. And two and a half hours of my life wasted. As for Heath Ledger, he wasn't terrific. He wasn't amazing. He was horrible. Weak. Sounded like a nerd. And he claims to have studied from ""A Clockwork Orange"" (please!), but he seemed more like he was doing a Johnny Depp impression, being silly and androgynous. It's just such a mess of a film. Horrible, simply horrible. And the reason I haven't mentioned Batman himself, is that he was so nothing, that there isn't anything to say about him. The main character seems more like a Vin Diseal character, and not a comic book hero. I understand trying to make the franchise more serious after being ruined by Joel Schumaker, but this film doesn't resemble a comic book in any way at all. It could have been a cop film, only the main cop had pointy ears, and the main villain had really bad makeup."
7092,True,"C'mon folks, you call this movie a masterpiece? The greatest movie of all-time? Sheesh, I thought people had higher standards than this.The only reason why people went to see this movie is because it was Heath Ledger's last performance. And boy, does he deliver! But is it really worthy of an Oscar? Well, that depends on how you interpret The Joker.To be fair, there is no right way to interpret The Joker. His past is just as mysterious as his motivation. But how can you create a character with absolutely no history and expect him to be believable? In the comics, his name was Jack Napier, a thug/ comedian who fell into a bath of chemicals that bleached his skin as white as snow. He had only one motivation for all the mayham he caused -- to amuse himself. This back story, that I've just given you, makes the villain far more credible than he was in the film. Even Charles Manson, one of the greatest killers of all- time, had a motivation for killing that made sense to him, but in this film we are never given any insight as to what this might be.Okay, so I have no problem with Heath Ledger winning an Oscar here. Then why did this movie suck? Because it was created for shock value instead of for entertainment. This movie has no plot. ""The Joker wrecks havoc on Gotham,"" is pretty much the only storyline you get. There are cars blowing up, people blowing up, people screaming blue murder and other bits of mayhem that make as much a sense as people screaming for mercy in a Godzilla film. Did Batman really have to fly all the way to Hong Kong to capture a corrupt banker or was that a ploy from the Chinese government to showcase the area for the 2008 Olympics? Why can't Christian Bale fight after all this time? Do you think those people on the boat would have talked things out in a ""civilized"" manner with the bombs about to explode? Me thinks pandemonium would have ensued, and that in the real world they would have dead in 10 seconds flat. Can you really set 30 million cell phones off to find one person? I think the writers wrote themselves into a corner on that one.Another thing that bugs me about this film is Two-face. The movie doesn't give lip-service to his love for duality at all. He just wakes up and goes ""Gee, I have a burnt face. May as well use it for scaring kids,"" and runs off plugging people, serving up his own brand of justice. To say that he was a hero was laughable, as people serve up their own brand of justice all the time. All you need to do is walk down the wrong alley at the wrong time to see what I mean.Overall, this film was terrible. Christian Nolan's vision of creating a modern Batman kills the whimsical charm and poetic lyricism established in the earlier movies directed by Tim Burton. Besides, Danny Elfman's theme will always be the defining music of the Dark Knight. By the way, what ever happened to the Bat Cave? They should never have taken that out."
7093,True,"This is the biggest ridicule after George W. not being able to spell the word 'nuclear' right. It is simply beyond my understanding how hundreds of thousands of people could have rated this film even worthy of attention. Batman, The Dark Knight is a piece of cake. With capital letters.OK, a huge fat turkey of a movie is not a new kid on the block. But no piece of trash has ever been so over-rated as this one is. I know that Heath Ledger's death came unexpected, and the guy was a solid actor, but you cannot praise something to the skies out of commiseration and loyalty. 'Cause however hard I am trying I am not able to find any other substantial reason why you would give Christopher Nolan's new embarrassment of an action flick six, seven, eight or nine points, let alone ten.This movie is lacking a consequent plot, a cohesion of the myriad of action scenes it has been broken down into and a common sense to know when enough is enough. Besides, I really don't know which film those who said the acting was brilliant had watched, but what I see is that Christian Bale, Maggie Gyllenhal and Gary Oldman all lack conviction and had the end of the day - and probably the collection of money - in mind when they stood in position in front of the blue screen. Oh, and quite often I really got confused; from time to time I needed to be reminded I was not watching the new James Bond movie or Terminator CXXXVIII (the gadget scene, the plane escape scene are truly pathetic, as is the concept of (re)introducing the character of Two-Face, the guy who did not read the instructions manual of the microwave oven).Since we are talking about a comic book adaptation I don't bother to mention how unrealistic action sequences are (try wiring a town hospital with all that security and CCTV cameras they got installed, or try buying - unnoticed - the oil reserves of a medium sized country to blow half of the city into the sky), but let me ask why nobody out of the immense crew that put this film together could pay attention to small details. Like when police forces storm the Hong Kong building to catch the bat-suit guy: 'Arigato, arigato!'- they wave each other up the stairs. Does this mean China needs to hire law enforcement personnel from Japan? OK, I am stopping there. I know I might already have made some enemies among comic book and action film lovers. This forgettable encounter with Batman however, reminds me again I am not one of them."
7094,True,"As a guy who loves the Batman Character and used to own a chain of comics stores in the late 80's through the 90's I found the new Batman film to be abominable. The handling of the Batman character was the worst I have ever seen, and I say that being someone who hates all of the other Batman Movies (with the exception of Batman Begins). It was a classic modern tearing down of an iconoclastic hero that was less realistic than it's printed counterpart. The Batman character would never consider revealing his identity to appease the Joker, because he understands that you cannot appease pure evil. He would instead redouble his efforts to find the Joker, not eating or sleeping until he did. The Batman of the comics is a detective who uses classical detecting techniques, coupled with a healthy dose of bruised knuckles as he harasses the underworld to find his query. In other words he uses no shortcuts he works hard.Hollywood used the opportunity to make a political statement, having Batman build a machine that taps into every cell phone in Gotham City, allowing for the altruistic Lucius Foxx character to opine about this act of immorality. A none to subtle swipe at the Bush administration. Then you have Harvey Dent (Two Face) who as the DA of Gotham, is described by Batman as ""the best of us all"" killing two dirty cops, and to save the fragile collective psyche of Gotham City, Batman takes the blame for the deaths of the cops. Why it would not make more since to simply reveal to the public that Harvey Dent went Coo Coo after the death of the women he loved, as a result of another act of murder perpetrated by the Joker, with the help of the aforementioned dirty cops and the trauma of being disfigured, is beyond me. Save that it fits into the paradigm of liberal thought that the people are to be protected from the grim reality of the world. Better to tear down the real hero of the saga and have him chased by the police. Keep in mind that the film establishes that the villains of Gotham know from experience that Batman will not cross the line and kill the worst of them. but we are supposed to believe that the public of Gotham will swallow that Batman would kill two innocent cops. WOW!Batman is a character who is truly good, and he has been tarnished by this film. In a world where Superman in his last film was reduced to a peeping tom hero with a babies mama. Psychopaths like Marvels Wolverine and the Punisher are hailed as modern heroes. A world where so many young people leave the theater declaring how cool Heath Ledger is as the Joker and not how scary the character is, I find that world tragic. As one of our old comic shop patrons used to say:""Give me the days when a hero had a letter on his chest, a magic word, a cape and a pet or side kick. A hero that fought the bad guys because he was good and they were bad and they needed their a$$e$ kicked. Let justice be done."
7095,True,"I don't want to waste more time on writing the review for this stupid movie, as I have already wasted my precious time watching it! This movies is over-hyped. c'on, IMDb gives it 9.2?? I mean are you serious?? lol........really this is the biggest joke ever, that an awful movie like this gets 9.2??!!! Direction is mediocre. The 'hissing' voice of batman is annoying. It was supposed to sound intimidating and macho, but it sounds as if he is having laryngitis, instead.Joker?? Was he really the joker (who never laughs??). A joker is a character, who is supposed to be full of surprises and tricks, and most important the one who 'laughs' in paradoxical situations. Unfortunately, this joker was not even close to the actual joker character.It seems, as if joker controls the whole city, but how and when, God knows? I can't go without mentioning that 'hyper sonar' machine, that can see every single person in the city. This time the director really jumped out of his briefs!! You evacuate all the hospitals in the city, except for the person for whom you are doing the evacuation!! lol........who was the writer?? I guess he didn't reach school higher than 2nd grade.I have so much to say about this stupid movie, but again, as I have already promised that even reviewing this stupid movie is wastage of time, so in the end, this is the worst movie I have ever seen, which paradoxically gets the best rating."
7096,True,"Time for a corrective. As I write this review, The Dark Knight is, according to IMDb voters, the Best. Film. Ever. At the risk of incurring a hail of brickbats, I must demur. Yes, Heath Ledger delivers an excellent performance, as does Gary Oldman as Lieutenant--er, COMMISSIONER Gordon--and it's always a pleasure to watch Michael Caine and Aaron Eckhart. But The Dark Knight is an overlong, over plotted, logically flawed, and philosophically confused film that cannot (and should not) be mistaken for great art. Compared to most comic book movies, it's not bad. Compared to La Regle du Jeu, it ain't so hot. The film's first half is actually quite good, and seems to come to a timely conclusion somewhere around the eighty minute mark. Unfortunately, this being a summer blockbuster, there's another 70 plus minutes to go, and the film's second half is a distinct letdown. Instead of ending on a neat and tidy note, The Dark Knight spirals off into a muddled mess of bizarre plotting (how DID that prisoner get the bomb sewn into him?), illogic (how does Harvey escape the hospital explosion--and why is he apparently impervious to pain?) and confusing action (too many ass-kickings in too little time). I don't expect 100% logical consistency from my genre product, but there are so many flaws and elisions of simple common sense in Christopher Nolan's screenplay that utter frustration sets in around the two-hour mark. By the end of the film, we're expected to believe that, for some reason, the residents of Gotham now need to revile Batman rather than reward him for his good work, setting up a police pursuit into the sunset that presumably will end with our hero receiving a ticket for speeding on the Batcycle. So let's tell it like it is: in terms of 2008 comic book flicks, The Dark Knight is inferior to both Hellboy II (which at least is charming and amusing) and Hancock (which raises far more interesting questions about the nature of the super hero)."
7097,True,"The Dark Knight is not a good movie, by any measure. I will now proceed to provide reasons for this statement, in the process of which SPOILERS will abound.In this film Batman (The Batman, as the characters refer to him) possesses superpowers rivaled only by Superman: he bends gun barrels using his bare hand (yes, only one hand) and falls from ridiculous heights, not deploying his cape, and lands without as much as a scratch to his body. The Batman is apparently not aware that it is not the fall that kills you, it is the quick acceleration at the end, and no matter the quality of the Batsuit, that acceleration cannot be reduced.On the other hand, his kevlar Batsuit which, evidently, is impervious to bullets of small hand guns fired at close range, is unable to withstand dog bites.The Joker, whose obvious insanity is the only light of the movie, is well-played by Ledger who flares with his eyes and mouth to give him an almost rabid portrayal, but other than being a dark menace to society, his odd manners and, at one time, drag outfit, provide comedic relief in the film.Apart from being just a regular killing maniac, he also possesses superpowers of his own: in the film, he is depicted with an apparent and sporadic invisibility to police forces. That they do not notice his deformed face without make-up in their own ranks during a salute may be pardonable, but when blowing up an apparently unsurveilled hospital on prior warning and then leaving, in full make-up, in a school bus (his escape vehicle of choice, also from bank raids), his failed apprehension seems unpardonable. Unless, of course, all the cops had their lunch break, as the sun indicates it is around noon.The plot is so thin at times, you expect it to crack at any moment. It is like there are many small plots, in all of which Batman, the purported main character, plays but a small role. Whatever the Joker has been doing all his life, before going on a murder spree, is pardonable to omit, but when he breaks into Bruce Wayne's penthouse (probably using his cloaking capabilities), the same locale that a few scenes later will be referred to as ""the safest place in town"" by the same person who was tossed out a window during this same brief encounter, it is an interesting question just how the maniac and his armed gang are persuaded to leave the party full of Gotham's economic elite, something they must have done without causing much further harm as it goes largely unnoticed by the other characters.Batman speaks with a deathly voice, that is so ghoulish it could scare off any foe, would he just make more use of it against his enemies, and not blather like that to his friends. That he finally tracks the Joker down, is not due to any superior detective skills, as he gets good help from prying on all of Gotham's mobile phones that he immorally and secretly has replaced with his own brand, all in one night's work. More ridiculous plot element is hard to come by."
7098,True,"This movie has proved again, that cartoon means junk, and whatever you do starting from a cartoon, it will still be junk. At least now someone else in Hollywood realized this, and made a real good parody of the cartoon genre. An extra joke is, that all this was masked as a serious superhero cartoon movie. Just some of the best hidden jokes I've found behind the cliché story:1. Batman kills at least a dozen of cops during the car chase, and makes some million $ worth of damage in the road, buildings. etc., but he is still the good guy. Sure.2. All the citizens in Gotham are totally stupid. First of all, they don't realize, that the only person, who has enough money to buy those hi-tech gadgets is Bruce Wayne, and nobody realizes, who Batman is. Second, it doesn't matter, that Batman's mask is covering only a small part of his face (his forehead and nose), they still don't realize, who is ""hiding"" behind the mask By the way, did you notice, that there is a face recognition software running on one of the monitors in Batman's hideout? The very same happened in the previous Batman franchise - looks like folks in Gotham didn't get any smarter in the past decades.3. Looking at the height of the pile, I guess that the amount of cash Joker is burning is more than there is in circulation in the whole world.4. All the mobs are stupid enough to keep their money in cash, so if they want to make a transfer, they have to hire a dozens of trucks. They haven't ever heard about electronic money. If they are so stupid, then how they can run a syndicate?5. Some billion worth of hi-tech gadgets is hiding in the basement of Wayne company. For years in nobody's mind turned up the idea to find a customer and make some money of it. They just wasted some million $ into it, and later they decided to hide it.6. The way the bat car and the bat bike moves is totally unrealistic. Also, such vehicles would be totally unpractical. For example, why are the wheels of the bat car in the front of the vehicle? Anyone can shot it with a simple pistol (these are rubber wheels), and game is over. The stupid design of the vehicle is proved in one scene, when Joker immobilizes the car (supposedly worths some million$ + the development costs, as this is a prototype) with a common RPG, which costs only a handful of dollars.7. When they bring down the chopper with the steel cables, the two guys must have know in advance, that exactly where (which street and what height) the chopper will go through. Keep in mind, that according to the plot, all these Joker sidekicks are mentally retarded people. And doesn't matter, that the chase is half a dozen mile long, they are just in the exact time at the exact place.8. Hey terrorists and wannabe terrorists! I have some good news for you! It looks like, that if you want to kill a major, then all you have to do is to get an uniform. (An uniform can be bought in any costume shop, you don't even have to beat policemen and take away from them like in the movie.) Then you can approach the major to point blank distance - the only problem is, that there are oracles in the police, too, who can predict the future, and jump between you and the major even before you pull the trigger.9. Blowing a building is an easy process. High explosives are strange artifacts, as you can move and properly plant hundred kilos within a couple of minutes into the designated places of a building. Also, when you blow up a building, you can stay 10 meters away from it, and you will suffer no damage from debris, rubble and/or air pressure.10. Ship crews are incredibly dumb. They can't realize that there are hundreds of gasoline in the engine room. Or even if they have found it, then they may have thought, that the captain is going to throw a surprise party for the whole crew, and in the barrels there is the stuff necessary for such party (vaseline).These are just some quick random things I can remember, I don't want to waste much time commenting this disaster. Let's not talk about obvious plot holes, pointless violence, superfluous subplots, and Bale acting like a wood - oh my god, why that deep voice when dressed as Batman?"
7099,True,"This movie is a non-plot action-packed propaganda movie. Which wouldn't be so bad but the combination is such that it IS the worst movie I have ever seen in my whole life. Seriously, when I came out of the movie theatre I was sick and angry at the same time. The whole movie is about approach towards the various kinds of villains, how they are and how they should be generally handled. You have about twenty propaganda lines, towards which each part of the film leads, those parts connected by a very feeble link. You could almost see the authors as they thought, hmm, we need to put this line into the movie, what circumstances will lead the hero or antihero to tell the audience this truth? Of course that made the movie a two hour drag where the twists and turns of fortune made you think if it wasn't a 10yr old child who wrote it. Ha, the setup worked we caught the Joker. Oh, Joker escaped, what are we gonna do? Then the good guys would realize that Joker wanted them to set up a trap, he wanted to be caught so as to get ..., escape and harm even more. Well, that is so childishly ridiculous, first surrealistic propaganda movie ever. So guys out there in the US remember. When you get spied through your cell phones, when your dear ones die in stead of a rich undercover agent, don't feel offended. Because to fight the ""crime"" or ""terrorism"", we don't need the good heroes (those apparently end up as dead half-faced wackos). We need dark knights. Sorry for my bad English. I needed to get this off my chest. So much approval, 9.2 user rating here, 94% on rottentomatoes, are that many people so simple or so easily bought?"
7100,True,"""The Dark Knight"" is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I've disliked most of Christopher Nolan's prior work, but was willing to be converted, and the rave reviews psyched me up.Drained of humor (even black), plot less, structurally inept, poorly shot, one-third of the movie coming across as a Pierce Brosnan Bond movie (Bale even goes into Bond autopilot without noticing), Nolan hasn't a clue how to make pictures or what makes humans tick, and I wish the undeserved hype around him as a director ended now. Ledger is dreadful, but the poor chap's role is so wretchedly written that his character never stands a chance. Not to mention Nolan's amateurish decision to make Ledger copy Vincent Price's ""Thriller"" voice, undermining any authority the character is supposed to have. By attempting to ground the Batman mythology in contemporary reality, it just comes across as plain silly. Nolan makes films for technology age emotionless drudges hiding their lack of self-esteem and identity crises behind a mask of hipness and faux-aggression. By going to see ""The Dark Knight"", Nolan is dictating to them that they are cool and superior. That the film is a horrible, poorly made, highly manipulative piece of work, is irrelevant."
7101,True,"My comments refer only to the 2008 USA release, aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 widescreen version (not the IMAX aspect ration 1.44 : 1, which could potentially be better)Sorry but the movie was AWFUL, Not worth the money! Special effects aside, gadgets, and the Batmobile which is a dream automobile, the movie runs 152 minutes too long, unnecessary ending, but most importantly does not have any resemblance to the original Batman series or the comic books, neither in character, nor intent.Best of the movie is the director Christopher Nolan,his attention to detail and superb sequences,i.e: bus braking out of the bank, the capture and return of Lau (Chin Han), the explosion, and the capture of the Joker (Heath Ledger). The characters are very intense, especially The Joker, Bruce Wayne/Batman, & Harvey Dent/Two-Face. The best and worst of the actors, I'll start with the worse. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine both accomplished actors they are probably two of the finest alive, Sir Caine was the worst of the supporting characters, neither of the two were convincing, they failed in their craft both were consistently bad actors in this film. The best was Heath Ledger hands down, his performance was top-notch, consistent, but above all spectacular. There will be a sequel to Batman: The Dark Knight which sincerely hope will be better."
7102,True,"I know I am going against the tide here. And I am happy that so many people had a good experience watching this film. I didn't. Maybe I just don't get it? I'm not sure, because I am a fan of superhero films in general. I think perhaps what I don't like is a superhero film that tries to be so serious as to make us believe in it. Batman, and previously I would say Unbreakable, fall into this category. If you want me to take you seriously then tell me this. How the hell does a guy with his face painted run around a city causing mayhem without getting caught? How does a guy who kills his accomplices continue to have support? I mean he even burns the loot so money isn't the answer. How does a guy who claims he doesn't like planning (because he's too crazy to care about planning) manage to get so many barrels of oil and dynamite positioned all around the city with ease. How does he get said equipment on to the two very important ships? A city that is on high alert? Was there nobody to check? The list goes on and on. If the film wants to be taken seriously, I think it has to fill these holes. If it doesn't, then no problem. There can be as many holes as you like.Another bad point was the length of the film. Far too long.On the plus side the acting was very good, although I didn't like the overly put on voice of Batman. However, Ledger deserves all the praise he has been getting for this."
7103,True,"I finally saw this movie because everyone kept talking about it. But for anyone who has seen more than a few movies (ie somebody over 20) there is just nothing there. Even without the hype I found this movie to be really painfully bad. A few points:---It seems the movie is trying to be realistic starting with something that looks like a somewhat believable heist. But then there are so many totally improbable things like batman's hideout and gadgets, the joker somehow getting zillions of minions, etc. So which is it a gritty crime movie or fantasy? I can't tell.---Haven't we seen ""witty"" dialog like this 100 times:Batman: ""Let her go"" Joker: ""Oh, very poor choice of words"" (drops her out window)When this happened my jaw dropped. This is worse than a Rambo movie.---I get it that Heath Ledger playing The Joker is supposed to be some crazy psycho. Hardly original or award worthy. Just looked like a hundred others we have seen before in other movies.---All ""characters"" are totally off-the-shelf. There's no depth or surprise to them at all. ---What does Rachel Dawes see in Bruce Wayne? In the scene in the restaurant (""I own the place"") he seems like a braggart and feels the need to arrive at his own party in a helicopter with three arm candy women on his arm. (Why isn't he already at his own place?)---Oh look a fancy party in Wayne's penthouse. I wonder what's going to happen? Look the bad guy comes in a starts tormenting people. Then Wayne has to change into his batman costume to save the day. How is this not 110% predictable.---Again, is the movie supposed to be realist? When arrested The Joker would really be forced to wash the makeup off his face.---Bruce Wayne saves the armored truck from a collision by placing his Lamborghini in between it an on coming truck. Aren't armored trucks stronger than sports cars. Yeah, I know Wayne has some magic tech. So at this point we are supposed to suspend disbelief.---I could go on. Obviously some people really like this movie. That's great but please don't say its anything like the best movie ever until you have seen some films from the AFI's lists http://www.afi.com/10TOP10/"
7104,True,"I wasn't so much excited about ""Batman Begins"". Simply pseudo-intellectual ""philosophy of fear"" was rather painful than interesting to me. Techno-futuristic Batman surrounded by oh-my-god cinema stars that have nothing to do with traditional Batman characters was nothing special to me. But this time I got excited. 3rd trailer was absolutely great, interesting interpretation of Joker (though vocally not so good as Mark Hamill but very original), a little bit of darkness, ""The Dark Knight"" reminding me of ""The Dark Knight Returns"" (that then I found out has absolutely nothing to do with the movie). It was great. But then... then come the movie... Movie that is absolutely boring, artistic-like weird and is so full of light that calling it ""dark"" is an abomination. If you want to hear the voice of Batman who apparently sings in a death metal band, go for this movie. If you want to see Gotham probably built and designed by IKEA (especially interiors), go! If you want to see ""bat cave"" so full of light that I had to dive under my chair to bring my eyes some darkness, it's the movie for you. But if you want to see anything really dark, atmospheric, Gothic, simply batman-like better remind yourself of things like ""Batman The Animated Series"" (1992) or Burton's movies (1989 & 1992) as you will find a lot of what Batman really is there, the real Dark Knight where word Dark means something and Knight is not meaningless as well. ""The Dark Knight"" is absolutely soulless like IKEA furniture and even Heath Ledger do not save the movie as his Joker is enjoyable for first 40 minutes, then becomes simply boring and all the same. What's funny, myself and audience around laughed much more when Batman spoke with his ""dark"" voice (death metal band vocalist, here...we...go!) than Joker laughed through the whole movie. It doesn't surprise me much as Ledger had the biggest problem with learning the mad laughter and although he did pretty well, lack of it during the movie, lack of single smile on Joker's face made it all look very pathetic. And then, here...we...go... with the plot. Batman decided to give up twice in the movie. Of course because he was afraid of what people think and self-critique. He apparently forgot that he started his obsession thanks to his parents death (oh well...). Alfred is dull and absolutely boring (I start to believe that it's just good to have ""Michael Caine"" name on movie posters). Lucius Fox is ohmygod-another-star-to-have-bigger-commercial-impact. Gordon was and remains not even close to what Gordon suppose to be, in my opinion. Etc. Etc. Finishing this counting-out rhyme with the Batman himself. Personally I love the way Ch.Bale acts. I admire his role in Prestige very much. But here... I don't see Batman, all I see is Christian Bale pretending he is Batman. Sad :(My conclusion is simple, Nolan's vision is far from what I consider as ""the dark knight"" and lack of darkness, lack of dark Gotham (not to mention that Gotham lacking of criminals who are too afraid to do their job instead of overwhelming Batman with number of crimes is simply a blasphemy), lack of darkness in Batman's soul and then lack of taste and common sense in the movie are something that made me yawn and look on my watch for nearly whole movie. Apparently audience thought the same as nearly every Batman's line produced fine amounts of laughter and maybe 10 people stayed to see first lines of credits (just like they would hear ""here...we...go..."" and decided to evacuate as fast as possible, literally).I know that the future will be completely different but I have high hope that Nolan will never, ever do another ""Batman"" again. Please... for the dark knight's sake."
7105,True,"Okay, I hate to have to do this but....this movie really was not that good. First: Ledger was good, a few times I felt he was unsure of his performance but other then that he was everything the Joker should be, dark, witty and sickly humorous. He is the only thing that makes this film worth watching. Every time he was on the screen I wanted more of him and every-time he left I lamented and got bored with pop corn action stupid high budget film affects...far from what traditional film making tenders to. Too bad the old method acting left him sleep deprived and well, no longer alive. If there is one film for him to end his career with it is certainly this. Second: Maggie Gylenhal is not hot, Wayne should have gone after the three girls he pulled up with in his copter, wow. Third: The thugs in this movie sucked, i was not scared of them what so ever, really all their performance did was make me laugh. Fourth: THERE WAS NO BAT CAVE....enough said. Fifth: There were too many stories going on at once, never did they fully develop into what I hoped they would have...Somewhat similar to The Prestige NOlAN. Sixth: Harvey Dent was okay, however when he turned into 2-face he just looked flat out stupid...and to me funny. Don't GET ME WRONG HERE. I HAVE BEEN RAVING ABOUT THIS MOVIE, SAW IT LAST NIGHT AND WELL GOD....IT DID NOTHING FOR ME. I base a films worth on how it makes me feel, in the end, I felt annoyed the Joker was not more of the center piece to this film. EVERYTHING WAS PREDICTABLE....I guess I should expect this with a postmodern popcorn flick ( all too centered around spectacle) concerned only with instant gratification and no digging to figure out latent meanings. Sure...in the end Batman will stay in the shadows, thats all the ending tells us. Didn't WE ALWAYS KNOW THIS????? I really cant go on...Batman Begins was a much better film. All you people had it so strongly in your head that this film was destined to be great that no matter what the end result was, your head tells you it was that very thing...great...when really it was a cliché action flick highlighted by Mr. Ledger himself. They should have called this film ""The Joker"" or of course, ""Why so serious?"". And of course like I said, focused more on what is one of the most original performances of the year in Ledgers. Nough said, pop corn lovers."
7106,True,"I saw this movie on a Monday afternoon in hopes of avoiding a long wait and big crowds at the theater. Good plan. It worked. The movie didn't. Many reviewers have already commented on the gross mediocrity of this film so I'll skip that part. There were some very good, though isolated, moments in the story: a lesson about how torture is wrong and doesn't work, the equal value of all lives regardless of how they have been lived, ""abridged"" civil rights are neither civil nor right, etc. I like all those concepts and they are certainly worthy of exploration given our current political state.To me, however, the most prominent feature of this film was neither Heath Ledger, (whom I greatly respect as an actor), Christian Bale, nor the script, directing, story line, performances, or suspense, but rather the gorrific violence that punctuated almost every moment of the more than two and a half hours this thing went on. Everything in this movie explodes!!! And the cut aways in the editing do nothing to mitigate the impact of all the slashing, stabbing, pounding, bludgeoning, shooting, and impaling that becomes ridiculous about halfway through. And though I have enormous respect for him, Ledger's Joker was basically Ted Bundy with face paint. I think the inspiration for this film came more from Oliver Stone's ""Natuarl Born Killers"" than from anything that was ever written in a comic book.All you need to know is this... In the last ten minutes of the film, with the body count hovering somewhere around 100, a scene begins to unfold where a young child is about to be murdered in cold blood, (those of you who have seen the movie know what I'm talking about). The scene goes on for what I thought was an excruciatingly long time, but even as it was just beginning I was thinking to myself, ""no, no, no, this is wrong. This should not be done this way in a movie"". Then somewhere in the theater, behind me, a child began sobbing uncontrollably. Yes, real terror, real horror, real fear, a real child, right there in the theater. The scene finally came to an end. The sobbing didn't. As the lights came up for us to leave I saw a couple escorting their approximately 12 year old son out of the theater, still sobbing, and hanging on to his parents' clothing as they walked out.I don't blame the parents. This movie's PG13 rating is unconscionable. This is a ""Batman"" movie! With a PG13 rating! ""Batman"" originated from a children's comic book series. One would think that this movie would be a safe experience for children. It's not. Given the grotesque thread of constant violence that runs from the opening credits to the closing credits it's not even suitable for adults. Several of the postings here at IMDb with the lowest ratings have noted that they are putting their rating as low as possible to balance out the overly generous perfect scores that have vaulted this movie into the position of being one of the greatest film ever,according to IMDb. Not me. I really didn't like this movie. And in the last ten minutes of it I came to hate it. It does not do service to the Batman franchise, or movies in general. There is not a shred of ""comic book"" appeal in it anywhere, and it will take it's place as one of the most uselessly violent movies ever made. That this offering has the broad appeal it has makes me a little sad, and sick inside. And if I could speak for the poor kid that was sitting behind me during this bloated gore fest I'd say this, ""thanks for the memories""."
7107,True,"I just saw The Dark Knight and it was even better than I expected and I expected it to be great. Most of this comment is about Heath Ledger so let me start by giving Christian Bale and the rest of the awesome cast, director,make-up,special effects team, writers, producers, and so on a huge thank you for doing such an amazing job in, and on this movie.Now for Ledger. People can say what they want about Heath getting too much praise just because he is no longer with us cause it just isn't true. Alive or gone, this was the performance of a lifetime. The make-up, the laugh, the mannerisms, every little thing he did was perfect. I have always had an image in my mind of how the joker was and this was finally it. I love Jack Nicholson because he is one of the best actors alive, but I am sorry Jack because Heath Ledger just out shined you and that is not easy to do.I was praying the entire movie that the joker would not be killed because it would have just been too symbolic and I would have lost it. I did cry at the end though. The ending when two face, the commissioner and batman are talking about life and death and how unfair and too soon it can be it really struck home and paralleled Heath Ledger's untimely passing.It is completely unfair that Heath's family and the world are going to miss out on such an amazing person with some of the rarest and rawest talent I have ever seen. I am a single mother and I can't even begin to imagine losing my daughter, so my heart goes out to Heath's family and his daughter. I am truly sorry that such an amazing man died so young.Dahr Prince"
7108,True,"It is inconceivable that this movie is anywhere near the Top 250. It is 2.5 hours of a coarse voice, explosions, cheap one liners, and terrible plot.Batman Begins, I thought was brilliant. It had genuine pathos, its characters were very believable and had depth to them. The acting was phenomenal.But this piece of crap, is completely the opposite. I have seen spaghetti westerns and children's cartoons with better acting then The Dark Knight. With the exception of the Joker, by Ledger, who was decent.There is no screenplay. There are explosions. I think Michael Bay actually produced and directed this.There is a random side plot to Hong Kong that had no purpose or place in the story. The cell phone tracking technology is the dumbest and most far fetched thing I have ever seen in a film.The only reason this movie gets any recognition or praise is because of Ledger's death. That plus the Batman and Joker fanboys that flood IMDb to give this crap a 10. They like how 'cool' Joker was, and sided with him, and they feel bad for Ledger. A + B = in top 10 of IMDb.This movie is completely forgettable and deserves no awards and none of your time. It DOES deserve to be an example of a horrendously written, poorly shot, poorly lit, pathetic excuse of a movie."
7109,True,"Let's open this review with the fact that Batman is THE BEST superhero ever, with no other even coming close to his levels. So when a sequel is made for an unforgettable movie like ""Batman Begins"" expectations are EXTREMELY high. I think that if you could describe this movie in a few words it would be ""152 minutes of pure awesomeness."" Christopher Nolan probably created the best ever comic book adaptation of a movie. The movie itself has been adapted in a much more realistic fashion than the comic book series. First of all this movie is PERFECT for people who like punches, drama, shooting and explosions. The movie has a complicated plot that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. It's anything BUT corny, since a few important characters die, and the ending isn't happy, but it's flawless. Christian Bale has proved himself one again as an amazing actor. Michael Cane (portrays Alfred Pennyworth) makes you fall in love with Batman's loyal butler. Now anyone that has seen the movie and is reading this review is probably wondering why I haven't mentioned the main reason why this movie is flawless. And yes, there is ONE main reason: Heath Ledger. Heath Ledger portrayed Batman's arch nemesis in this movie: the Joker. Now anyone who has a clue in comic books knows that the Joker is INCREDIBLE. Heath Ledger's acting in this movie has turned the Joker into a LEGEND. I have never seen such perfect and realistic acting than the portrayal of the Joker in this movie. The Joker is portrayed in a much more mature fashion than the comic books, and that's why it was so good. It's simply impossible to describe him: he's bold, insane, smart, twisted and he's so awesome in this film that at some points you love him even more than Batman. If I haven't mentioned it by now, this is without a doubt the best movie I have seen.Those who come with high expectations after seeing ""Batman Begins"" will not be disappointed. I advise that no one under the age of 11 watches this movie as Two-Face's appearance is rather frightening and the film contains intense action."
7110,True,"""The Dark Knight"" is the most anticipated movie of the summer, partly because it's Nolan's follow-up to the fiercely adored ""Batman Begins"" and partly because it features Heath Ledger's last performance, as the Joker. That makes one good reason to see it. As much as I disliked ""Batman Begins,"" finding myself not just unmoved but bored by its alleged darkness and moral complexity, I concede that it was at least a real movie, with a thought-out structure, a reasonable degree of character development and, most significant, an adherence to visual logic that was at least workmanlike. ""The Dark Knight"" offers the same degree of murkiness, both visually and thematically, and maybe even a little more. And Nolan gives us enough multilayered subplots to at least fool us into thinking this is a work of intellectual and moral complexity. But as a piece of visual storytelling, from shot to shot, ""The Dark Knight"" is a mess. Characters disappear from one locale and show up inexplicably in another, thanks to the magic of editing. At one point, we learn two characters have been abducted, but Nolan doesn't bother to show us who did it or how. (Later, he explains the ""who did it"" with dialogue -- the lazy way.) At the end, a major character is left hanging, literally, as we are figuratively. If this is genius, give me hackery But ""The Dark Knight"" looks as if it were made from a messy blackboard diagram with lots of circles, heavily underlined phrases (""Duality! Good vs. evil -- in the same person! Kinship between hero and villain!"") and crisscrossing arrows that ultimately point to nothing. With ""Batman Begins,"" Nolan assured his audience that he understood that the characters originally created by Bob Kane -- and further developed by the likes of Frank Miller -- were rich, fascinating ones, and they are: It shouldn't be hard to write good stories around them. But what the Nolans have come up with here is just more pretentious poot, dumped onto the screen in a style that pretends to be fresh and energetic but is really only semicoherent. This time, Bale's Batman/Bruce Wayne finds himself involved in a romantic rivalry with the handsome and extremely principled Gotham D.A., Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who has taken up with Batman's onetime love, assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes. Katie Holmes, who played Dawes in ""Batman Begins,"" has used her newly found Scientologist shape-shifting capabilities to morph into Maggie Gyllenhaal, and the effect is pleasing: Gyllenhaal's Dawes is a tough cookie in a Stanwyck-style bias-cut gown, and the movie feels smarter and more supple when she's on-screen.Many of the characters from the first movie return here, busying themselves in this or that corner of the plot with little or no consequence: Morgan Freeman is back as the tweedy genius Lucius Fox; Michael Caine, as Alfred, miraculously gives the movie's overserious dialogue some genuine dramatic heft; and Gary Oldman as Lt. Jim Gordon (he's not yet commissioner), so terrific in ""Batman Begins,"" seems lost here -- in one scene, his enunciation was so bad I wondered if he wasn't just trying to underplay the movie's self-important dialogue. (That dialogue includes choice pseudo-topical sound bites like ""Some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. Some men just want to watch the world burn."") Nolan moves his characters around the screen, in jagged diagonals and crazy swoops, in an attempt to explore the dark side of human nature. We get robber-clowns in scary masks, Batman look-alikes committing evil deeds, troupes of urban villains that come in all colors and sizes. A lot of stuff is blown up. The violence is swift and brutal -- including a pretty nasty trick involving a pencil -- although Nolan tastefully (and wisely) cuts away sharply at the crucial moments. There's an assortment of perspective shots that create the illusion we're looking -- or falling -- down from the top of some extremely tall buildings. To encourage thoughtful beard stroking among his audience, Nolan throws in a ""Lifeboat""-style (Who should die first? Me or the other guy?) plot device.There's no dramatic arc in ""The Dark Knight"" -- only a series of speed bumps. The moments in the movie that should be the most dramatic are glanced over so quickly that we barely have time to register what has happened. I'm not sure the actors know what's going on, either. Bale was a tolerable Batman the first time around, even though he ultimately failed to dissolve the distance between us and that mask. Here, he tries to build on that earlier performance. In ""The Dark Knight,"" Batman is misunderstood and mistrusted by the people of Gotham, who see him as a vigilante and not a hero who strives to protect them. Bale is slightly better as Bruce Wayne -- he's such a good actor that he's capable of conveying the deepest anguish in a single, flashing blink. But his Batman, lumbering through the movie in a suit that's supposed to be lighter than previous incarnations, is a flat, dull creature, with no new tricks up his gauntlets: Playing this moody superhero, Bale has run out of shades of gray to work with.Ledger's performance is unsettling and difficult to watch, partly because it's impossible to remove it from the context of his death. But it's a fine performance regardless, and I wish the movie around it were more deserving. ""The Dark Knight"" may be somebody's idea of a masterpiece, but I doubt it would be Hitchcock's. Nolan may want us to believe in the darkness that lurks within each of us, but instead of leading us to it visually, he chops it up and sets it out in front of us, a grim, predigested banquet. The difference between Nolan and his idol is that Hitchcock demanded that we trust ourselves; Nolan demands that we trust only him."
7111,True,"I've felt moved to comment on this movie if only to provide some much needed balance to the string of 10 out of 10s being awarded. My real rating would be about 7/10 but I can't stand seeing this up at number 4 on the top 250 list , it wouldn't make my top 100! The plot was confusing and ludicrous throughout.The 'moral dilemma' of the two ferries at the end really spoilt the movie for me. Why weren't the passengers diving off the boats and swimming for it ? would both boats (especially one full of ex-cons) really have taken the morally high decision to choose death to save the others ? Some great scenes, special effects, cinematography, lighting, dark mood etc. Brilliant performance by Heath Ledger but overall the plot let this film down."
7112,True,"This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. The actors are good, as is the cinematography and the editing, but that's that. The script is a bunch of completely rubbish lines with no real meaning and special effects that have been done thousands of times and aren't interesting enough to keep our attention. The score is distracting.The villain is the most implausible villain I have ever seen. People who do evil things have purposes, the Joker doesn't have any. Even if there was a person like that, s/he wouldn't be able to have minions, because that kind of madness isn't a shared one. People kill for power or revenge, (or money, which is another type of power), basically. They have to have a purpose to unite and do evil things. All of the BS the joker said about evil and good completely miss the point about good, evil and humanity. They simply don't make sense.And what makes me furious is the fact that a lot of intelligent (or at least more or less intelligent) people are quoting those lines as if they meant anything. They don't. And they aren't even entertaining."
7113,True,"One couldn't help be sceptical of the hype surrounding The Dark Knight before having seen it, scepticism was certainly weighing on my mind as i walked into the cinema. I couldn't help thinking 'is this going to be as amazing as expected, or is the hype just an inevitable reaction to the death of Heath Ledger?' I can safely say to anyone still having not seen The Dark Knight; the hype would've been just as massive even if Ledger hadn't tragically overdosed during filming, The film is mind-blowingly amazing! The action sequences, The dialogue, the editing, the lighting, the costume, the score, the cinematography, The Ledger, The Bale, The Eckhart, The Freeman, The every-single-tiny-bit of cinema... is brilliant.There's not the slightest whiff of the child-friendly-cinema that tore Tim Burton's vision apart all those (not many) years ago. Eckhart's Dent/Two-Face, blows Tommy Lee Jones out of the metaphorical water, the only shame is that his performance will be overshadowed by Ledger's even better one, and indeed his tragic demise.Every insane laugh from Ledger's lips echoes with excellence, Jack Nicholson should be very very very proud. However, Ledger's delivery, commitment, presence and dress-wearing-ability far surpass the realms of merely paying homage to Nicholson's Joker. Nolan and Ledger really show Burton and Nicholson just how darkly immense the joker can be.Not to forget Bale, who brings his portrayal of Batman (and the barking voice it brings) to the next level, the depth and inner conflict create an excellent empathy effect on the audience and also create ridiculously good viewing.I could go on all day, going into every actors success, about how immense The Dark Knight is... but i think you probably get the message by now.As undoubtedly one of the most difficult films to bring to the public, a film so swamped with hype, tragedy, death and scandal; The Dark Knight could easily have been written off with the tragic death of Heath Ledger, we should thank God that it wasn't."
7114,True,"The Dark Knight's extreme popularity must be due to saturation advertising, hype, the popularity of the Batman franchise, and a star-studded cast. Looked at objectively, it fails on a number of levels.SPOILER WARNING: This comment talks extensively about the plot of the movie.A) The script is full of illogical events. 1) Batman jumps out of a window on the 50th floor to rescue Rachel, catches her, and smashes with her onto a car in the street below, and they both walk away unscathed, despite the fact that no parachutes were deployed and no wings broke their fall. 2) The Joker somehow fills large places throughout the city with large oil canisters full of explosives, with no one seeing, including Gotham's largest hospital and two ferry boats, after advertising that these places would be targeted. 3) Midway through the movie, the white knight of justice, District Attorney Harvey Dent, does a 180 degree turn when his girlfriend is killed and becomes a psychotic killer, for no reason whatsoever. 4) Early in the movie, the Joker goes on a rampage and then makes demands and the entire city clamors not for his defeat but for all his demands to be met. 5) Dogs can bite through the bulletproof bat suit. 6) Two Rottweilers can take down and immobilize Batman. 7) The Joker can singlehandedly overpower Batman without any weapons. 8) The police act as buffoons throughout the movie: they put the Joker in a cell with other prisoners; interrogate him without handcuffs; let him out of the interrogation room when he takes the interrogator hostage; and give him a cell phone to use, which he then uses to trigger an explosion in the building that kills everyone but, miraculously, him. 9) The Joker drives alongside a police caravan and systematically picks off one police car after another with a bazooka, and the police continue driving along at the same plodding pace. 10) Batman shoots at the Joker and fights him and flips his 18-wheeler truck, but when he is about to hit the Joker with his motorcycle, he crashes it instead and puts himself at the mercy of the Joker in a fit of GI Joe morality. 11) Morgan Freeman objects to Batman's cell phone mapping technique, saying ""Too much power for one man"", and resigns as his assistant, despite Batman's lifelong pursuit of lawless vigilantism.B) Aesthetically the movie is unimaginative and uninspiring. 1) Batman as a fighter is stiff. His suit is like a slab of sheet metal welded together. His movement is the opposite of the smooth, flowing martial artist one sees in classic samurai or judo movies. Batman arrives without stealth, by smashing through windows into hails of gunfire, and departs in a similarly unstealthy manner. This is the opposite of how a ninja would behave: with intelligence, grace, simplicity, and secrecy. Similarly, the Batmobile smashes through reinforced concrete walls and sits still to absorb a hail of gunfire. The Batman envisioned here -- smashing everything in his path, and indestructible -- is more like the Incredible Hulk than a bat. 2) Set design is drab. The scene in the kitchen, of the conference of mafiosi, is plain, uninspired, and unimaginative. The parking garage scene is aesthetically dull. The bat cave is quite plain -- just a long, empty room with a low, internally lit ceiling, without any gear whatsoever.C) The casting is poor and the acting uninspired and sloppy. 1) Morgan Freeman is a dreadful choice. His acting and presence is like the feel-good music that often accompanies his scenes. Just play the music and skip him. 2) Aaron Eckhart relies too much on his good looks and smile and not enough on acting. He sounds like a motivational speaker -- that is, a liar -- trying to convince, but unconvincing. His body language in the scene on top of the building is very fake: amateur-aggressive. 3) The actor playing Commissioner Gordon is about as good as a director standing in for an actor who couldn't make it to rehearsal. He has no energy or presence on screen. I appreciate understatement in acting, but he seems to be half asleep and mumbles his way through his lines. 4) Maggie Gyllenhaal is unconvincing as the object of desire of both heroes. 5) The black mafia boss is terrible. The other mafia bosses are not much better: overacting without direction or intelligence. 6) The man who turns from a meek bank supervisor to a tough vigilante in the first scene is too self-conscious, and his transition is unbelievable. He is too recognizable as an ""actor"". 7) The acting by extras is very bad and poorly directed. When the Joker says ""half"", the chorus of laughter is like that in a high school musical. The same unanimity of action is found at the press conference. The thugs in the parking garage seem like models, not thugs.D) The editing is too fast; transitions are largely dispensed with altogether. 1) There is no pause before the cut to the trial; dialogue from the two scenes runs together. 2) The scene at the benefit party is unconvincing: Bruce Wayne drops the models immediately, people applaud immediately, it's over. Scenes are too fast and perfunctory.E) In its larger themes, the movie proves to be just as illogical and perplexing as in its minutest details. The end of the movie carries this message: ""Sometimes the truth isn't good enough ... Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded."" This is used to justify the creation of a myth of Harvey Dent as ""Savior Of Gotham"", and to explain the need for making Batman the fall guy for all of Dent's crimes. However, the movie makes no attempt to explain why Dent, the psychopath, should be eulogized and not Batman, the hero. The writer floats a thesis about the human need for myths on a raft of unpersuasive evidence."
7115,True,"This review is for you, if you have watched it, and are wondering if it was brilliant and flawless. Or was there a tiny little ""hard to point your finger at"" thing that was wrong with it?I am an avid Batman fan, who has been devouring the Frank Miller graphic novels that depict the grim and gritty side of the dark Knight. I have followed the tidbits and stories on Dark Knight for over a year. Batman Begins marked the beginning of one of the most amazing ""ordinary superhero movie"" ever witnessed. Four years later, as I stepped into the hall, and awaited the beginning of this new movie, the excitement was almost palpable.I was not disappointed. The movie had enough chills and sadistic pleasures to keep me hooked and unable to look away from the screen for the most parts. And yet, when the credits rolled, I had a queer feeling, as though something wasn't entirely right.A few hours after the sensory overload, when I could finally think,I realized one of its drawbacks was dwelling into too many story plots simultaneously. For instance, we follow the joker through a long, and sometimes cumbersome car chase, which except for that final brilliant (and much publicized) truck sequence, was nothing great. We have been lead to believe that the joker is a man who attacks psychologically, and is not physically strong. This is portrayed eloquently in the interrogation scene.As a result the car sequence became the sort of cliché they could not avoid despite the possibility of becoming the only boring sequences in an otherwise splendid movie. I remember because, I caught myself yawning.Also considering how Joker is the arch nemesis of Batman - the yang to the Dark Ying, the absolute bad guy, Two Face pales by comparison. No doubt, the make up and graphics are grotesque and excellently done. But we just are not able to believe that he is capable of the menace that Joker manages to exude.I just could not believe that Two-Face was that bad. The directors have somehow failed to bring the transition between his characters. If i remember the comic books, the disaster drove Two Face insane, making him dependent on the coin even for small decisions.The real trouble if you ask me, was bringing in a new villain in the last half hour of the movie. One that made the joker's final confrontation with Batman seem a little unsatisfying. I kept expecting them to show Joker one last time. He didn't die, did he? Yes, I do understand how Joker is the arch nemesis, and its Batman's great burden that he can never kill Joker, and they are back at it time and again...but Ledger is dead. We know he won't return. So we, as audience wanted an ultimatum. Not a dangling loose end and definitely not a dangling loose joker from a building top.Enough with the criticism. I am Batman fan. A son of batman, if you wanna call me (ref: Frank Miller). I loved the style. I loved the bat pod, the first robbery sequence, Joker's pencil disappearing trick, the flick of his tongue, the little line about Joker completing Batman, the other line about joker being the dog that chases the car and not knowing what to do if it catches the car...Dark Knight was about Heath Ledger. Sadly, we wanted more of him. It JUST WASN'T ENOUGH! Batman as always was his sporting best, the flight sequences were brilliant, Caine and Freeman had the best lines apart from Ledger. Aaron Eckhart did a great job as Harvey Dent, though I did feel that Two-Face lacked character. I expected the sort of chill Javier Bardem inspired in No country for old men, when he tosses the coin. Instead, Two-Face's tosses were merely just passably interesting. Oh, I must really commend the Nolan brothers for doing away with the only female lead, and in such a sudden and scary way. I almost couldn't believe it.Enough has been spoken about Ledger. I do not want to be repetitive. Clearly, his lines were the best. But more important was his body language and sequences, which were to say the least, eccentric. Kudos to Nolan for a good script, something that could give Ledger an opportunity for such a mind blowing performance. He sparkles in every scene, and we only wish there was much more of him.A word on Bale. As Batman, he is the best ever. As Bruce Wayne, he does excel in a few scenes. But were those scenes requiring Bruce Wayne driving around in his Lamborghini necessary at all? In the quest to make The Joker the most remarkable villain ever, some of the dilemmas that made Batman the Dark Knight are never questioned. Batman Begins did such a good job of bringing in the character. Why leave him like hanging like a prop actor in this one?Some of these sequences could no doubt be shortened. Batman could have been given some character and Two Face could've been the surprise element, AFTER a somewhat more definite end to JOKER, and the movie would have been a tad more awesome. I would have given it a 10. Instead I give it a 9. I dare not give it less than that...Background score was brilliant. The scenes involving Joker, just before he mutilates someone, or pops a psychological question, are well, horrifying. I was almost squirming in my seat.Over all a brilliant movie. A landmark Batman film, that ends on the right note, ready to jump headlong into the next phase of Batman's life. I only hope it doesn't take four more years! Long Live the Batman franchise. Long live Nolan fraternity. RIP ledger."
7116,True,"So this is the movie that created one box-office record after the other. I really expected quite something, but was left disappointed. It's definitely not a bad movie. There are many things that are good entertainment and worth watching and definitely one of the better movies this year, but come on it has so many flaws. If you think that a movie like matrix which is more original, more intelligent, better from its action-sequences and so on and so on just didn't earned that much at the box-office.The most disturbing thing is probably the amount of realism they tried to put in a comic book story. Which always confused me as a viewer. That doesn't work for me. I think there was a hype created in America that pleased the hardcore comic book fans but i think the main reason why it was so extremely successful in America is it's dealing with Americas 9/11 Trauma.The whole movie was kind of a propaganda movie for the government and its actual foreign policy.When you see Batman standing in the ruins of an exploded building together with the firemen it evokes images of 9/11. And America's desperate yearning for a hero. Someone who will clean up with this scum. But what made ""it"" a scum isn't really told. A super-villain like the joker is just mad in a comic book. But in real life who is mad and who is not is often just a matter of the point of view.The prisoners in the one boat evoke images of Guantanamo. And it justifies their illegal and often unjustified imprisonment of innocents with the words of the people of ""other boat"" . Why shall we have mercy with them. They blew their chance. But still we give them much more than they deserve. It still was a nice gesture giving them some kind of redemption by letting tiny lister throwing the detonator outside.In the end Batman stand for me as a symbol for ""W"", because he is blamed by the people even though he is doing it seemingly just for them and sometimes they don't appreciate it or even understand it.Next thing was how often and illogically they let the joker get away. I mean come on. The just cut to another scene and he is free. Thats so cheezy.Batman hits him up like nothing and the man doesn't even bleed a bit. Other real people he just hits once and they are K.O. I thought the Joker had no superpowers but here he seems invincible.Then you wonder how quick he has everything planned without ever getting a touch of an recruited army behind him , even though he seems to have tons and tons of toy soldiers. I a comic book it works but in a movie where they try to put a lot of realism in it it feels weird. First he is in prison but he is so foreseeing everything. Maybe i need to see it again. But it felt weird.The action sequences felt not really thought trough. The whole chase tunnel sequence was so unrealistic. i mean first the police somehow never hits back. And joker just shoots and shoots and shoots. And it felt unreal.Maggie Gyllenhall felt miscast. She maybe a favorite in art-house productions but here you need someone with obviously more sex-appeal. I never bought it that they fell for her.The the totally unrealistic wounds of Harvey dent turning into ""two-face"". Come on. No one would have such an open wound. Isn't ""Two-Face"" a mad scicophrenic in the books. Here he never feels mad, just like a guy trying to get his revenge. Thats what I mean, with the amount of realism. Here a mad character from the books is explained in his madness, but the main character the joker which is a synonym for any terrorist threatening America isn't explained a bit. Yeah better that way. One might get scarred that one self turned that man into a terrorist. So they better leave that explanation out.Then the much hyped about heath ledger (r.i.p.) performance. It was good but not that great. For me it was just an update of the Nicholson joker. He even talked much like him and his facial expressions also resembled Nicholson's expressions. So whats all the hype about. He is still performing very good but not legendary. I have seen better villains.Then it seemed like there were many points in the movie that resembled of ""L.A. Cofidential"" One scene in the end where they let Harvey dent die as a hero is one of them but there were others too which i forgot.So after all. Worth watching. Good movie. But too overrated. And i still don't understand the enormous box-office-records."
7117,True,"Two viewings. First viewing reaction: ""Possibly the worst film ever made. Brilliant, subtle Joker performance weighed down by an overly pretentious film. Why is Batman even in the film? Confusing chase scenes. Confusing to the point of boredom. Ridiculous James Bond episode in Hong Kong.

Fell asleep halfway through. Woke up in the middle of a Morgan Freeman plea for individual freedom, or something like that. Why am I here?"""
7118,True,"Heath Ledger's edgy portrayal of the Joker is a frightening and macabre vision of the Clown Prince of Crime. Sure his costume is the right colours, but shades of purple and green have never looked so muted like he's been dragged through the filth of alleys and gutters. His makeup is a halloween gone wrong: applied blood red over torture scars, smudged & cracked white wash, blacken sharks eyes of death, capped by a entangled toxic green weave of hair. While his lip smacks and tongue snakes, his many quotable psycho babble tirades on chaos and madness had this preview screening audience in silent shock and awe. As fans, we wait to finally hear the Joker's maniacal laughter...we are rewarded. But it is a chilling laugh that plays on our nerves with a subliminal shrilling echo that will haunt us long after the film. His facial twitches and deliberate gestures work to induce a hypnotic and mesmerizing hold on Gotham/audience. His weapon of choice (not the lint or veg peeler) is the knife, for both it's ability to inflict a visceral cold kill and likely because it was an instrument of his own twisted grinning origin. The lack of origin story is also effective as an open book for the imagination. The hand held cam scenes of Joker 1st POV filming his prey and the off cam torture is a stark reminder of the realty of terrorist footage. From the sick punch line of his disappearing pen trick to becoming a masochistic punching bag for The Batman, Joker can certainly dish out as well as he gets. The Joker casts pure fear into the minds of Gotham by testing the citizens beliefs and moral lines of good and evil. This Mad Dog of Chaos thrives in a world without rules, where even the Good of Gotham can succumb to corruption and conflict. Hence his handiwork in the transformation of Gotham's White Knight to Harvey Two Face Dent.The eerie background ""music"" is like a deaf tone barbed-wire noise that rings through Gotham's cityscapes as a harbinger of the Joker's evil to come.In all fairness Ledger cannot be compared to Nicholson. Its Apples and Oranges. Burton's 80's film delivered a comic book to screen, thug turned clown which was hammed up with the flair and suave that's stamped with Jack's vintage trademark. Ledger has redefined the role and delivered a nightmare Monster that won't let you awake or escape. All truly memorable screen villains are able to forever get into the mind of the protagonist and audience. It is with this performance that Ledger/Joker joins the ranks of the top three cerebral cinematic killers, namely Hopkins/Lecter, Spacey/Doe.This is a tour de force Oscar worthy performance that lives up to the hype (rare thing) and even raises the bar (even rarer). So kudos to Ledger/Nolan and TDK Team for unleashing the perfect villain for The Batman. And remember, the next time you're playing a card game your hand may come up with the Joker's signature calling card. RIP HL."
7119,True,"I mean,this is the best movie ever??the number ''1''??Is it better than ''the godfather'' or ''Braveheart''? I think not. People are talking a lot about Heath Ledger's performance,but in my opinion,Jack Nicholson was a much better joker,because he had a twisted sense of humor and a background that the viewer could relate with,this new joker is just a sick individual with no clear motivation and an absurd point of view. Shall the Academy give an Oscar to Ledger??Who cares???Everybody knows who are going to be the winners months before the ceremony,and i wouldn't be surprised if this stupid action flick won best movie,best director and all the other Oscars... Batman should be made for children to see it,how is that possible??This as an ultra-violent movie with Batman being a torturer in some scenes. Some people give ''the godfather'' 1 star and this bizarre experience 10...what is the world becoming??Does special effects and bizarre characters make a good movie??the best one ever???Only for the small minded... The good old days are over...and with this ''turd'' on the top of the list,IMDb looses all the credibility...if the Corleone's were living in Gotham, this joker wouldn't last a day uhauhauahauuahua...."
7120,True,OK first of all i happen to be a real superhero fan hell you should see the space used here to store all my comics so i usually don't have high demands for a superhero movie i like em all at least until i went to see dark knight that is i went expecting a superhero movie instead i got violence violence some more violence and to top it off some violence at some point i actually started to check watch hoping it would be over soon this movie didn't need a batman the way it played it reminded me off those old B-movies you know the good guy gets ticked off and goes after the bad guys bad guys are usually crazy pure violent guys and you end up with 90 minutes of killing shooting and so on this is basically how the movie went first you have the joker who wants chaos and destruction thats is the entire story about the joker no debt in the entire character that is his only motivation and you never get to know why so the movie starts with the joker fighting everyone batman the Mafia you name it this goes on and on and on when you finally think the movie is over and batman won it starts all over again then they add two-face the only believable char in the entire movie but he plays like 5 minutes overall i went in with high hopes after 30 minutes i hoped the story would get started after 90 minutes i was checking watch hoping it would be over soon i think movies like that should have an LBO warning (Leave Brain Outside) when i noticed the score this movie got i felt actually depressed and i really hope someone boosted this score by cheating the alternative is so horrible i can't even describe it so i keep on trying to convince myself the world is not as bad as that score tells me it is
7121,True,"I was not expecting this film to live up to the hype, but it didn't even come close to living up to my lowered expectations. I give it 3 stars only for Heath Ledger's performance, which was very original and nicely done, but still not deserving of the rave reviews it has been receiving. Even his excellent performance was brought down by the horrible script he had to work with.It's all been said before, but:The acting of every cast member except for Heith Ledger was wooden and utterly boring.The Batman character was unsympathetic and had none of the appeal that was built up in ""Batman Begins"" of a tormented soul nonetheless trying to do good. In this film he is both boring, nasty, and indecisive.Every fight scene was mechanical, unoriginal, shot in dim lighting, and used none of the stealth that Batman is supposed to use.Batman's voice was laughable and got worse as the film dragged on.Way too many convoluted and disconnected subplots to keep track of. I had no idea where the story was going at any point in time, and didn't care. I watched this on DVD and started fast-forwarding through large chunks about 2 hours into the movie; should have done this sooner.Every character spouted sophomoric monologues about good and evil that were unconvincing. A good script gets these messages across using the plot and actions of the characters, not through monologues.The Joker's various schemes and escapes were impossible to believe even in the context of a comic good movie. How could the Joker walk into a hospital, with full makeup on, and walk right up to Harvey Dent, who is unguarded, *after* the Joker has already kidnapped and disfigured Dent once, *and* the Joker has announced he is going to attack a hospital? This kind of thing happened countless times. I love comic book movies (e.g., Xmen 1 & 2, Iron Man), but in the good ones you can believe that the events would actually happen within the context of the fantasy world of the story.The love triangle story felt tacked-on. What in the story showed you that Bruce Wayne and Rachel, or Harvey Dent and Rachel, had any affection for each other? You are just supposed to accept all of this without any effort by the scriptwriters or actors.The Joker has an endless crew of henchmen, but why would any criminal agree to work for the Joker after he assassinates his entire crew in the first scene? Why would any criminal agree to work for him if his goal is just to cause chaos and not to earn money, and he burns all the money he earns? Don't criminals normally want to get money out of risking their lives to commit crimes?Two and a half hours is way too long. An hour could have been cut without missing it. Compare this to any truly great movie (Gandhi, Godfather 1 & 2), where several hours just fly by.The scriptwriters couldn't decide whether to make this a ""realistic"" drama or a comic book for the screen. So they flip-flopped back and forth. Case in point: a witness on the stand pulls out a gun, Harvey Dent disarms him, and then wants to continue examining the witness. This is slapstick and is impossible to swallow if we are supposed to believe this is the ""real world,"" but it could work if the whole movie set a ""comic book"" tone in which ridiculous things like this happen. But it didn't, so the inconsistencies are just jarring. At least the Tim Burton films -- and even the campy 1960s Batman TV show! -- created an internally consistent world.I was ready for the movie to be over, when in comes a whole separate story about Two Face. It was completely out of place with whatever plot arc still existed at that point. Plus, the transformation of Harvey Dent's character into Two Face made no sense, as did his ability to survive a car-flipping accident. Then we witness him shoot Batman, who we have already seen surviving hundreds of bullets without a scratch, and we are supposed to be surprised when Batman leaps up again, unharmed?I could write another whole review just listing more plot holes.Again, I am a big fan of comic book movies and even enjoyed Batman Begins, but this was a real loser."
7122,True,"Well, this film is the most overrated movie I can remember but that doesn't mean it sucks at all. It's well made, with great shots and good acting (at least by Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Heath Ledger). The action scenes are filmed more coherently than Batman Begins and that pencil trick was awesome.Still, there are too many ridiculous scenes (like flying out of a window with a cable attached to a plane and cell phones turning into radar machines) and completely unnecessary plot lines. Do I really care if Commissioner Gordon plays dead for half the film and his wife gets mad at him or some Chinese guy is hording the criminal's cash? No. Give us more confrontation between the hero and villain. Lastly, the dark themes this film deals with are taken a little too seriously for a movie about a superhero of sorts. He wears a cape and a mask and fights crime as a symbol... don't try and get me emotionally involved in any THEME greater than that. Develop the characters and make me care about them. The animated ""Batman and the Mask of the Phantasm"" did a better job with that.Whatev, i've rambled long enough. It's still a very enjoyable movie and if I see it again i'll probably like it more but there's no way this deserves all the praise it gets. I'd really give it a 6.5 out of ten but we can't do .5s and this definitely does not belong in the top movies of all time. Too bad because it might be worthy of a 7 or 8 had it not been hyped up like it was the gift of Zeus."
7123,True,"This movie was so wildly praised by critics and fans alike that it was hard not to have somewhat diminished expectations. It can't be *that* great, right? Right.I can't say this is a bad movie, just not a very interesting one. It begins promisingly with a superbly executed set piece, with the Joker staging a daring bank robbery. This is a very nicely done action sequence, and Heath Ledger's Joker does indeed live up to the hype. It's a genuinely strange characterization, and the story built around it should work.After that, the movie starts to drag. There are far too many long, talky sequences, followed by the usual slam-bang action scenes that are shot from a distance so you can't see what's really going on. What's really missing from the action is any sense of a story; there's just more of the same that you usually see in a superhero picture. Been there, done that.Another fatal mistake is one that happens far too often: too many villains. This was a major problem with the 90s Batman films: you have to squeeze the Penguin and Catwoman and Christopher Walken into one film, with no time left for anything like character development. In this movie, the focus is on the Joker, but that's not enough: we have Two-Face into the mix (who only becomes Two-Face at the two-hour mark, leaving only a short time for him to be dispatched by our hero).Two-Face was my favorite of the old Batman Rogues Gallery, and he deserved a story all his own. Throwing him in as an afterthought to the Joker (particularly when Ledger's scenery chewing overshadows everything else in the picture, including Batman) both makes the film far too long, and blunts its impact.Lost somewhere in all this is Batman, who almost seems absent from the picture. Although he has to make a tragic choice, there seems to be no character development, and Bale's performance is practically phoned in. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman contribute their customary gravitas, but again this just adds to the extreme length of the picture.Batman Begins was a strong picture, and I'm puzzled as to what I'm missing here. I saw this on Blu-Ray and found myself reaching for the remote every ten minutes or so, to see how much longer I was going to have to watch this. I finally hit Stop by accident at 2 hrs., but decided to just let it go. This movie failed to engage my interest on any level and I just wanted it to end."
7124,True,"I waited until the DVD came out and the initial media coverage had played out. This movie made money only due to the unfortunate passing of Heath Ledger. Throughout the movie I transitioned from ""when is this movie going to get good"" to ""when is this movie going to end.""Christian Bale is a fine actor and we were able to see his talents in the first installment. He had very few scenes where the audience could see these talents in this movie. He was regulated to the Batman Costume and his Clint Eastwood voice impersonation. This was unfortunate. Heath Ledgers performance was good, but not award worthy. He kept sticking out his tongue while speaking to make his character look crazy. Gary Oldman has played much better bad guys in his day and Heath Ledgers performance does not match any of those or Jack's for that matter. Maggie Gyllenhaal was fine but her role was so limited that they could have pulled all her scenes from the movie and the plot would not have skipped a beat. She is a fine actress but we did not get to see much of those talents in this movie.Aaron Eckharts did an excellent job however his characters transformation into Two Face was rushed. It was kind of like they ran out of time and had to rush him into the bad guy role because they spent to much time elsewhere. I will probably check out the third installment when the time comes, but I hope they get back to the format of the first movie. They let the the actors do the work in that version vice putting all the emphasis the superhero & bad guy characters. If they are not going to let Christian Bale act then they can put anybody into the batman suite and it will not matter. This installment is also getting to the borderline where far fetched gadgets are concerned.It's unfortunate this movie made so much money as it will give the production team a false sense of accomplishment. If they repeat this performance they will bomb next time around unless they catch another break with another unfortunate off set tragedy."
7125,True,"I just watched ""The Dark Knight"" and I really am shocked that people who vote on this site can possibly say that this film is on the same scale as ""The Godfather"", better than films like ""Ben- Hur"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Goodfellas"" and pretty much every film made since talkies started in 1927. I mean everyone who could possibly rate this film so high has to be born after 1990. I mean I'm 38, have seen and own over six hundred films, and to me this was an overlong over-hyped film to the max. Being a video/film editor I thought the editing was appalling. The acting, well it wasn't bad I mean Heath Ledger was good in his role his acting was tremendous. His character, however has no background, all we know is that either he or his father gave him scars. Bale's Batman which was great in the first film, doesn't know whether to hang it up, be a hero, or become a hunted animal. The rest of the cast well, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman can never do wrong, but in this film they are really just used for show. Gary Oldman, one of the best actors working today who is generally a chameleon when it comes to characterization, doesn't even bother to try to cover his English accent. Eckhart's Dent was just plain annoying until he becomes Two-Face, and that's almost 2 hours into the film. I was just disappointed, the first film blew this away."
7126,True,"It is within the list of the best movies I have because of what I saw, as the writer excelled in the writing of this story, in addition to shine representatives who carried out this great work, we saw the Joker in the film, where he was a major reason for the success of the film with Christian Bale, which embodies the personal nicely very. Christian Bale is always creative in other films, but this is work, especially in the Dark knight 2008 is the most prominent and successful Alomes him. I liked this movie a lot and I liked the characters in this beautiful film and I hope that the dark knight of the series do not stop and continue on like this, which is a little like I've seen it in other works Thank Christian Bale Thanks for the director and his staff with representatives"
7127,True,"The Batsuit can deflect bullets, but it can't withstand a dog attack? Holy Wardrobe Malfunction! If I were Bruce Wayne, I would have kicked Morgan Freeman's backside back to The Electric Company, and sued the crap out of the firm that made the material that was supposed to protect my richer-than-God self from the likes of Cujo! But then, that would make way too much sense, and ""sense"" is something that the Batman franchise has never been accused of having!Say what you will about Tim Burton's and Joel Schumacher's Batman movies: at least they never pretended to be anything other than silly popcorn flicks. Christopher Nolan, on the other hand, wants to be Ingmar Bergman when he grows up -- which is why he rips off Burton! Don't tell me that ridiculous standoff was a happy accident, Ledger grunting ""Come on, come on, hit me"" à la Jack? Batman doesn't turn The Joker into roadkill because he has a moral code? Give me a break! And, for a self-proclaimed ""agent of chaos"", every one of The Joker's actions are oddly well-planned and executed. Memo to Nolan: look up ""chaos"" in the dictionary!Which leads me to Ledger. Since when does twitching like a coked-up Mexican jumping bean constitute acting? No disrespect, but let's be real: if he hadn't died, that truly morbid Oscar campaign wouldn't have sprung up, and he wouldn't have been nominated, much less, won. As I could never understand Ledger half the time because none of his directors had the balls to tell him to enunciate like a normal human being, he had to have been dubbed, because I actually understood every word he said!And it's ""close to the vest"", NOT ""close to the chest""! Idiots!"
7128,True,"bad parts of this movie:--The action scenes sucked, other than at the beginning. -The action scenes consisted of the joker saying something stupid, batman hitting him, the joker hitting him back and then walking away, and something exploding -In a good movie, the good guy is supposed to be a little weaker than the bad guy and has to overcome it, but batman has radar vision and can fly while the joker has nothing but a knife-This movie was not inspiring. What does it inspire me to do? Pay a British douche a lot of money so I can dress up in robotic bat suits and catch criminals.Speaking of the bat suit: -If part of batman's sacrifice is that the city hates him then WHY DOES HE HAVE A SPECIAL UNIFORM? If you're supposed to be hated by everyone, wear a ski mask and stop advertising yourself. If you are trying to be loved by the people, then you can advertise.-The movie created so many dumb unimportant plot lines and nothing ended up happening. Right after the love triangle, the girl died. That guy said he was gonna reveal batman's identity, but nothing happens.--There was so much that didn't make any sense. -How does one guy in Hong Kong do the accounting for all the criminals in Gotham? -Why is it the biggest problem in the world that 5 people were killed in 5 days? That's better than things are usually in big cities. -Why don't the gangsters the joker is talking to kidnap him? etc.-The joker wasn't creepy. There is nothing creepy about a guy wandering around in face paint and giggling. If he walked in to a bar, cut a guys head off, and then ordered a salad, that would be creepy.-A superhero should be a superhero because he did something cool. Batman is a superhero just because he's rich.good parts: -The credits."
7129,True,"Even for a blockbuster cotton candy movie, this is a piece of crap. Got a script that makes so sense, characters that you don't care about and mindless violence and unbelievable set pieces.How do you know the joker is a guy that just likes to see things burn? why first Alfred tells us that and if you didn't get it the first time, the joker then tells us he just likes to see things burn and sure enough if that was too subtle for you, he then sets things on fire! Then there is the fact that keep on calling him a terrorist when he goes on about how he only care about chaos. First of all a terrorist is a person who acts because they do have a strong belief not because they have no beliefs. Terrorist do the things they do with a goal in mind, they are in fact the total opposite of the Joker character.Then you have a film that's basic message is hey sometimes it's OK to lie and pretend someone is a hero when they aren't. Wow what a wonderful things to support, I'm sure George W. bush loved this film.Then there is the acting. how hard is it to play completely crazy, not that damn hard, just because Health Ledger is dead, doesn't mean his acting is suddenly good. He was not a great actor and he sure isn't in this film.Too long, so boring."
7130,True,"First of all things i should say i am a comic-book fan. From Eastern Europe. Why is this important? Because here its something really different then in the USA. In the USA comic-books are part of the everyday life. Here it is not. Here it is an underrated genre, and most of the people still think it is something sissy for small children and contains only fighting and dialogue no higher level then Kapow and Boom-Boom. And it was even worse when i was little. It was always a little treasure hunt to get some. And most of them was bad rip-off, cheap junk from the above mentioned category, and it was only Batman, who continually represented quality and was available for a kid like me too. And i was amused and loved it. Not Batman in the first place, but the amazing villains. And especially Joker. He was the best of the best. Maybe the most complex, interesting and remarkable character ever created.And to tell the truth, i wasn't entirely satisfied with either one of the Batman films made up to the Dark Knight. Especially considering that there was an absolutely brilliant animated series: Batman the Animated Series, check it out if you like Batman, well worth it. They first 3 movies were okay, but the Batman and Robin and Batman Begins both sucked big time, but for different reasons. I lost hope i will ever see a really good and faithful adaptation of this comic. Then along came this one.Yes it has some overdone parts, some flaws here and there, a bit rushed and corny ending, but its good, meaningful, and Heath Ledger (who i disliked before i saw this) is the absolutely perfect Joker. When i saw the casting, i thought it is a disgrace. After i saw the movie i thought he was unearthly good. The film has suspense, great acting, emotions, and a very interesting and coherent plot which is very rare in Hollywood blockbusters. Well worth watching for anyone and everyone. Especially for people, who think comic-books are sissy things for little children..."
7131,True,"Sigh. They almost got it right, and with the right franchise too (Batman as the HUNTED hero had the most potential as allegory for the male human condition). Unfortunately at some point the fact that this is a reboot (of a reboot)^3--in just the movie series alone--is a problem. It implies a serious weakness in the CONCEPT ITSELF.As I was writing this review I asked myself just when did I drop out of this movie? -11 minutes in. By then there were already enough annoyances to have induced my disengagement. Here are some of them: 1) The reboots(!); 2) the bank job prologue (opening scene) which adapts the basic story of 44Minutes:The_North_Hollywood_Shoot-Out(2003 made-for-TV docudrama); 3) wasting William Fichtner in a nothing mobster role all over in a second; 4) too many red herrings with the ridiculous faux ""Batdudes""; 5) Batman's audio-""soured"" voice; 6) Lt.Gordon(Oldman)'s similarly but accidentally audio-""soured"" voice in the vault scene as he says ""we'd have to hit all the banks simultaneously, SWAT teams..."" (we DID notice,sorry) --and all this within the first 11mins!!Then there was the manipulative attempt at confusing the ignorant in the audience with the ruse about Commissioner Gordon. Anyone who knows this term will not accept LIEUTENANT Gordon's untimely death, but it's enough to turn us against the screenwriter. This is called ""ratcheting"" the plot, aka ""yanking the audience's chain"". And there's a lot more where that came from in this movie--that's its main problem.One admittedly unavoidable problem was caused be the basic pull--antagonism--in a graphic novel adaptation into live action: superhero comics naturally venture into the fantastic, and it's hard to show the impossible for real. If you're trying to insert fantasy into a police procedural, you cannot get gross or outlandish in the way you represent this.For instance, during the transportation scene with Harvey Dent(Eckhart), although it already rankles that the truck-driver's offsider does nothing to prevent the hijacking during the VERY OBVIOUS criminal misdirection with the burning firetruck, the over-the-top nature of the graffiti'd word ""SLAUGHTER"" on the side of the attacking rig just makes you lose patience with their abandonment of their previous police procedural tone.Ebert likes this installment best. I know why; it's because this sequel tries so hard to be both realistic and allegorical towards society's ills, but it's at junctures like the above hijack scene that if they get it just a little bit on the ""wrong"" side for people like me, they take us out of their picture.And I have bad news for the filmmakers: sooner or later we will all be thinking like this. It's a function of their having raised the bar, but just not far enough, so it undermines its own standard.For people like them, CGI is a trap like catnip. It's all in the tone that you strike; and if you decided that it's OK to depict Two-Face's face all in CGI, revealing teeth underneath the skinless CG-muscle and tendons on that side, then you deserve the flak you're going to cop for it. Here it is: what a SHODDY, mistaken choice that was! It makes your almost-great movie into an embarrassing piece of ""shlock""--YES, there is a word for it.Shlock. Or shtick. Where is Mel Brooks when you really need him?More examples of wrong tonal balance:7) the dinner debate scene about Batman's future role in a democracy is theoretically very admirable, but misfires because it's misplaced at the table amidst all the verbal fencing between two couples(!)--its gravitas is lost in the shuffle;8) Bruce Wayne's awful speech pillorying Harvey Dent undermines our faith in him too, which he tries to undo for Rachel Dawes (Gyllenhaal's annoying replacement for Katie Holmes again smacks of ""rebootism""). His venom was unnecessary, what was his point?;9) (just a little bit) more screen-time should have been paid to the emergent concern of Harvey/Gordon's prisoners in the traffic snarl, so we could emotionally join in on the ferry for the scene's significance for humane compassion. The battle of wills with The Joker about this was significant, but the audience doesn't get to chew over the so-called Prisoner's Dilemma (from game theory);10) Two-Face was too rabid in his scenes. He/Harvey used to be well-adjusted, so the (ratcheted) petrol burn and the accidental loss of his fiancée simply didn't justify why he became so violent. Without showing his back-story, it's irresponsible to either kill him or turn him so deeply and irrevocably psychotic, all in one picture. Where's the deep significance of ""what he lost""?; 11) Dent's hospital-room yelling is implausible: he shouldn't have enough strength to roar at Gordon, let alone have the option of rejecting skin grafts. No ER patient would be given that option. Since this is completely implausible, why ruin our disbelief?;12-A) Dent's skeletal musculature CG vision is also wrong within the Batman mythos. But burn victims never have clean muscle afterwards anyway, so why depict a falsity when you could have just applied practical prosthetics? -for obvious directorial (self-)indulgence given access to cheap CGI;12-B) there was no plotwise reason for the deep burn either, since Batman was rescuing Dent from the flames. Why was Two-Face burned? -Again, purely directorial self-indulgence with CG (I would've loved to hear the screaming-match in the Exec Prod's office about this);13) the darkened interrogation cell for The Joker was also audience-manipulative directorial self-indulgence. The room, if you recall, was darkened excessively during Gordon's interrogation, just so the Batman reveal could shock the audience. Completely implausible; wouldn't have worked in real life because reality can't control ""the fourth wall"" (the audience's POV). Overripe and ridiculous.B-TDK(2008) does contain several great points, but I'm not wasting word-count on them. Suffice to say that ""Jingle bells, Batman smells, Robin (CLEARLY) ran away""..."
7132,True,"I wouldn't say this is a bad movie, it's still good entertainment compared to other 21th centuries block busters that fail in every possible way. But it has NOTHING to do in the Top 250. Sorry IMDb, kids who know nothing about cinema took over your ranking system.The main grudges I'd have about this movie would be:1. It is way too long!!!! It'd been a while since I last experienced the feeling of expecting the credits to begin each time a scene would end. I was like ""OK, then, the end?"" and the movie would keep going into some nuke the fridge like action scene that has nothing to do with the main plot, as if the directors told themselves ""People paying money to go to the theater want to have bang for their bucks so let's give them 56 explosions, 87 wrecked cars and 77 dead guys"" (fictive count, but you get the idea) Toward the end I was completely out of the movie, focusing on not peeing in my pants.2. What's with 2 face !? I didn't know about 2 face making an appearance in this episode. I thought it was all about the Jocker VS The World. Boy I was surprised to see this coming straight out of nowhere right in the middle of the movie. But hey, at that time I thought ""nice way to introduce 2 face, could it be the next batman they make will have him as the main villain?"" So I was kinda expecting a ""The End"" screen when, say, the Jocker sets him free from the hospital so that the movie is still coherent with the others. Like, ""OK this time batman half won, the jocker is introduced as its arch ennemy and there's another freak out there to spice it up, the end, to be continued..."" But the movies keeps going and going and going and going............ ALTHOUGH IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT STORY!! It's as if they packed 2 movies in 1, seriously they should have called it ""Batman Vs The Jocker featuring 1 extra villain""Of course, there's also the ""2 face is dead"" thing when we all know he's coming back a few episodes later. I can't understand why they made it that way. It would have been so much easier to have for example the 2 of them drop into water and only have batman to reach the shore leaving a question mark over 2 face's fate. Completely cliché, sure, but at least they're not killing someone to have him reappear in a sequel (oh hold on, maybe batman and gordon and all the cops can't tell the difference between a corpse and a living fellow?)I could go on forever on all the flaws like:_ cell phone crap (yeaaaah right OK it's batman but still.... and like 1 guy alone could trace millions in real time...)_ stupid prisoner's dilemma in the boats (since when criminals have morals?)_ ""I burn money 'cause I don't care but I rob banks"" stance of the Joker_ the batcave is now located in an almost empty room in the docks_ alfred burns his master's letters (come on, why so serious alfred?)_ batman is strong with men but weak with dogs (where is the batkick at?)_ batman's awful voice (puberty at 35 between Begins and TDK?)_ the joker has no plan but everything goes as planned every time_ the batpunch carpets big fellas but the jocker can handle it no problem_ crime syndicates give away their money to keep to some Chinese guy nobody knows, trusting him to keep it safe (since when criminals trust each other over money concerns?)_ gotham changed a lot between 2 episodes...and on and on ...I repeat this is NOT a bad movie itself, it's just WAY overrated. It's just another action movie that you go see to put your brain on low power mode for a couple of hours.I would have put a 5 or 6 on it but we need to counterbalance the tens that cinema uneducated dumb kids put."
7133,True,This is one of the movies of all time. There's action beyond belief and humor that breaks down the tension that really works. There also enough emotion to round out the experience. The joker is one of the best characters of all time. He's truly amazing. R.I.P Mr. Heath ledger. Christian bale is of course one of the best actors ever. It's truly a gift to watch them on screen. See this movie it will make you a better person.The ending is perfect and amazing. Every time I watch it pick up something new. There was a lot of effort put into this. Better than batman begins but not as good as inception. It's actually surprisingly under rated.
7134,True,"I'm so relieved that I'm not the only one who doesn't think this movie is great. I saw this first in the theater, and to be honest, probably would've given it a bit higher rating...if I would've reviewed it then. But........I just watched it again on cable and it doesn't hold up as well outside of the movie theater with it's huge screen, dark room and loud speakers. First off...what I liked. Heath Leadger was fantastic as the Joker and could've done so much more with it if the writing and plot had been better. The movie should've focused on a battle of wits and balls between Batman and Joker. That would've been more interesting. I liked Morgan Freeman. I enjoy his character. I like that there wasn't some big distracting relationship for Batman/Bruce. I even enjoyed some of the explosions. I hate Christian Bale as Batman/Bruce. He just doesn't emote anything. Also...HE HAS THE WORST BATMAN VOICE EVER....EVER....EVER!!!! The movie was way too long and had way too many subplots going. I could've lived without the whole Harvey Dent thing. Why introduce Two Face just to kill him off? It made no sense. Then again, a lot of the subplots made no sense. The movie takes itself too seriously. There's really no humor either. I realize the whole idea was to make it dark, but sheesh, c'mon. There were too many just shoved in there explosions going on. It felt like two movies being rammed into one. It's just too much. Too many things going on that don't really gel together. I guess I'm tired of movies that offer more in explosions and chases than solid story telling and characters you can give a damn about. I honestly could not sit through this movie again. If I do anything, I'll watch it free on demand and fast forward to the Heath Leadger scenes. He did so much with what he was given to work with.....which wasn't any where near what it could have been. All in all...this movie doesn't live up to the hype."
7135,True,"Let me preface this by saying that the dark knight is a good movie.Unfortunately, that's all it is. Not excellent, not a masterpiece by ANY means, and anyone who tries to tell me this movie's a CLASSIC, save your breath. This flick's a summer blockbuster and nothing more.let me start out with the good parts: Heath Ledger and Michael Caine. Both actors brought good things to the table and prevented the movie from being just dismally bad. When I first saw Ledger was to be cast as the Joker, I was disappointed; I guess I'd been hoping for someone different. What a sleeper he turned out to be. Unfortunately, Ledger essentially carried the film. He was the one strong performance among the leads. Some aspects of Ledger's Joker were downright creepy, creative, and most importantly, convincing. Props to you Heath, you were quite a talented actor. Michael Caine as Alfred was as good as he was in Begins, but he's a pretty minor character which is a shame.I'm pretty neutral about Morgan Freeman, he did a good enough job, but could've been better, which leads me to my next point: the script. What an awful piece of trash this was. The script was the reason why Lucius could've been better; it certainly wasn't Freeman's fault. The lines were flat, the storyline was contrived, and there were plot holes en masse. I think the Joker's lines were OK, as they fit with Ledger's portrayal of him. It was a shame, then, that the writing for Batman, Bruce, Dent, Gordon, and Lucius was completely flat.I think what irked me most about the movie was Two-Face's role. It didn't work in the film at all. It almost seemed as though two face had been some kind of afterthought. Dent was all well and good, but two face was in the movie for all of 25 minutes, and killing him off at the end was mind-bogglingly stupid. Two-Face had such potential, especially for the 3rd movie, and the character was a complete failure.More plot holes than you can shake a stick at. Everything went like clockwork for the Joker, from the bank robbery to the interrogation to the jailbreak to the mayor to the hospital. It's all WAY too easy. The story isn't coherent at all and was also too complex. I could have done without about half the minor characters.Nevertheless, none of that stuff really bothers me nearly as much as this: people are calling it a 'masterpiece' and a 'classic' and 'timeless'. That last one really gets me. What are you, stupid? this movie embodies none of those words. Wake up, people. Check back with me in 25 years and if it's still #5 I'll give it some thought. For Christ's sake, it topped the chart for like 2 months! that to me is just obscene. Tell me that it's better than Casablanca, Seven Samurai, Goodfellas, a Clockwork Orange, Rear Window, Seven, and Apocalypse Now and try keeping a straight face. In a perfect world, TDK wouldn't even be on the top 250, but I'll be happy when it gets below #150. Read: 'when', not 'if'."
7136,True,"The only list this movie should be at the top of is ""Most Overrated"". When I wasn't dozing off, I was hoping a fire alarm would evacuate the theater. I won't jump on the Heath bandwagon because he's six feet under. He was AVERAGE. To quote another review, if Heath gets nominated for an Oscar, I will never watch another Hollywood movie again.Plot holes the size of the grand canyon, overall terrible acting, and about 45 minutes of useless fluff at the end. Had this been the real world, The Joker would have been caught about 15 minutes into the movie and the credits would have rolled. Too bad that didn't happen.I will not be seeing the next Batman in the theater. That I can guarantee."
7137,True,"Well I wanted a Frank Miller style movie and I got one. Just got back from the Montpelier VT hosted premiere, presented by Senator Leahy and WB CEO Barry Meyer....Heath's haunting portrayal as the Joker was captivating; this is the wild, anarchist, and truly disturbed loon we've been waiting for. I'm glad they kept any concrete origin out and instead opted for explaining Joker's existence as a necessity to Gotham's order and control. From the Killing Joke' ""Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another... if I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!"" He wails on Bats in one scene with cane and knife, using the strength of a madman, contrasting sharply with Batman showing restraint just when you really think he might lose it.The development of Two-Face played out well, showing his transition from strong public leader Dent to the duality driven, obsessive Two-Face, raging against free will. I'm proud to report he didn't rob the 2nd Gotham Bank at 2pm on the 2nd of February.Batman/Bruce give us what we expect from where Batman Begins leaves him; as a very very busy vigilante. It is nice how little change he goes through as Bruce, against how detached he must become, and how far he must fall as the Batman.Other than that, cool gadgetry from Wayne R&D of course, almost all of it believable. Sonic suit, cell phone hacking- a glimpse of ORACLE? wait till you see the bat-bike show up --- (eruption of cheers)Hardly any confusing effects, stunts or fights. Well choreographed and executed."
7138,True,"In the world of Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight,"" Batman is to the Joker what Dirty Harry was to Scorpio. Like Eastwood's Harry Callahan, Bale's Batman isn't above smashing heads, cars, and civil rights, in his brute-force quest to bring justice to a lawless city; like Andy Robinson's psychopath, Ledger's gleefully nihilist Joker seems to enjoy having the stuffings beaten out of him almost as much as he delights in highjacking schoolbuses and committing murder, up close and personal.I've never been a huge fan of comic book superheroes. The Green Lantern was pretty cool, however I generally prefer guns to super powers, and have always thought there was something a little ridiculous about a man in tights and a cape who flaps around the city, fighting crime. Which is why I was not a fan of the previous Batman movies. However, with ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight,"" director Christopher Nolan has attempted to free the character from the albatross of campy convention, reinventing Batman as a kind of urban ninja. The previous films were all about style over substance, whereas Nolan has re-imagined everything from the batsuit to the batmobile in a way that makes them seem more practical, functional, and--most important--more believable. There's a gritty reality about this Batman. He gets hurt and has to stitch himself up, Rambo-like. He gets bitten by dogs, fer Chrissakes! Moreover, his gadgets don't spring magically from thin air, but are the result of meticulous engineering on the part of Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), who is Batman's answer to Bond's ""Q"". In fact, the Nolan/Bale Batman has more in common with James Bond than he does with his own prior incarnations in film and print. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the dazzling ""Operation Skyhook"" scene.With ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight,"" Nolan and his team have worked the minor miracle of making an utterly fantastic character seem plausible, which is no small accomplishment. In so doing, he has also brought a great deal more respectability to the genre. Truth be told, though, ""The Dark Knight"" isn't really a ""genre"" picture at all. Nolan goes about the film as if he's never seen a comic book before, the result of which is a breathtaking departure from every other superhero movie ever made. This isn't a superhero movie so much as it's a hyperkinetic crime thriller mixed with a psychological horror film: ""Heat"" meets ""Silence of the Lambs,"" with a delicious dose of sly theatricality. Everything about this film is exceptional, from the cinematography and visual effects to the fine acting and the snappy, intelligent script. But as anybody knows who has already seen it, Heath Ledger owns this movie the way Al Pacino owned ""Scarface."" Ledger's Joker is a self-described ""agent of chaos,"" out to prove that people aren't worth saving in his own giddily vicious way. During one of several mesmerizing exchanges with Batman, the Joker explains that he's not a monster, he's just ""ahead of the curve."" Ledger's performance is an elliptical masterpiece of existential rage and sardonic wit, alternately ferocious and funny. The brief but brilliant scene of the Joker, dressed in an ill-fitting nurse's outfit, fiddling with a malfunctioning detonator, was clearly an audience favorite if the applause and laughter were any indication.Can't say too much more about the film without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it. Suffice it to say, even if you're not a fan of superhero movies, ""The Dark Knight"" is what great movie-making is all about.So, why so serious? Get out and see it! Let's put a *smile* on that face..."
7139,True,"I can't believe this movie got so high ratings! Have you all lost your minds?! This is one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen, and I'm not talking Batman's kicks being more than match for bullets! This is a comic-based movie, suspension of disbelief is due with regard to things like that or cops cooperating with Batman (cops don't like sharing *any* power, and neither does the govt apparatus, which would rather have Joker murder a hundred of civilians than let one vigilante like Batman go free).Where suspension of disbelief is NOT due are the movie's messages that it dumps in truckloads on viewer's heads! Aw the poor corrupted cop who did this because of her mother's hospital bills! Aw hear ye the socialized medicine is needed! Aw! Aw we do spying on people where necessary but it's still wrong! Aw! Aw we never kill villains, even when they wrong-do us! Aw! Aw the prisoners are at heart good people, we just should re-socialize them more! Aw! The scene that topped all the other in hypocrisy and idiocy was when one of the prisoners has thrown the detonator for the 'civilian' boat through the window. In real life he'd be pushing the button in a second. This is where the movie gets it all wrong. Or perhaps it lies to us but in such way that we should notice? After all, at the end of the movie we are lectured that some things are more important than the truth? Like, having a hero with bad taste in women? Speaking of which, you don't really believe that Brucey and Harvey would swoon all over the mediocre-looking Rachel? In real *real* world the two would rather be jointly gang-banging the Russian ballerina (which was a stunner) than trying to get Rachel's affection, who in turn had a misfortune of a scriptwriter getting her spout the mandatory post-feminist line (oh Bruce don't make me any chance blah blah), but let's put this aside and come back to make-believe real world.Strangely, in this movie the only character with an ounce of sanity was Joker, he just did not let that sanity get in his way. Have you noticed this? He was the only character that the scriptwriters let tell the truth; how things were in his view. Everyone else was a puppet with mind tied up by shallow politically-correct slogans. So even here the movie got it wrong: the Joker *was* sane, just evil.All in all, this was not the epic battle between good and evil, but between dumb and evil. Perhaps that is why this movie was after all so *boring*. The characters are shadows of their former selves from previous Batman movies. This is a version disinfected from everything that has mental life, like in one South Park episode where the directors digitally replaced all the guns with walkie-talkies in their movies. This movie has had that kind of surgery applied to it at the scriptwriting stage. The result is a neutered cat instead of a tiger. Tragedies portrayed in it are fake, we feel that characters portrayed in it do not feel what they exhibit, but exhibit what they feel they *should have been* exhibiting, because they feel watched all the time.One of reasons the movie is not believable is precisely because good guys do not pull the trigger. The good guys are PC pussies with lawsuits worrying them more than bullets. The dumb ideology, and yes, politicized world-view, emerges even in selection of the main hero: a lawyer. Lawyer as a hero? Puhlease. Everyone is a walkie-talkie for some false line, you get the idea. This is a movie staffed with mannequins instead of characters.I had a gnawing suspicion somewhere at the back of the head when I was watching the movie that all of it was result of cold calculation, that it was all just designed to pull emotional strings of naivetés with whatever calls, once to ""never kill a villain"", then to ""tax-funded health-care is Good!"" thing, then whatnot. This movie does not believe in itself. Why should I believe in it then? And don't tell me 'it's just a movie'. Yes, it's just a movie. Just an exceptionally dumb one."
7140,True,"How many times does a crook have to be caught and released over several boring hours to make a movie feel dynamic? Spoilers - if Joker has so few people in his 'gang' (especially if he goes around killing them on a regular basis), how does he get the large set pieces sorted out exploding buildings and boats etc! Yes it was fantasy that much is clear - but rushing from set piece to set piece drama, tension, explosion is poor production technique. But a 9.1 rating over 270,000 voters - this will be a lone voice probably in the love fest that has occurred around this title. Please no Oscar nominations. Glad I got that off my chest."
7141,True,i have never been so bored the plot was totally predictable and it just never seemed to end it kept going on and on and on. the best bit was when the love of Batman's life died. my husband and i both nearly walked out cos it was so boring. the amount of times that the joker was caught was unprecedented and the heroes just had no brains about them as to what he would do next it took 3 of them to catch him and then he still got away. personally preferred Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the joker and as for batman what is with that fake voice? This is the worst film i have seen in a long time. as for it being a 12a who's idea was that? it should be a 15 so a warning to all parents. anyway don't waste your life wait till it is the DVD clearance shelf at woollies.
7142,True,"After I was done watching this movie, I was sitting there waiting for it to begin. There was no story. There was nothing for viewers to hope to happen or not to happen. Unbearably trite performances all around. Can Morgan Freeman play anything other than Morgan Freeman? I was waiting for the scene when he tells Batman that he is really God and that Batman has to be God for a day, i.e. Batman Almighty.We're given no reason to care about anything that happens to any of the characters. This was a classic example of weak screen and story writing covered up by special effects, explosions, and other eye candy. The only thing redeeming about it was some decent ambiance and directing, but in that regard, it did not live up to Batman Begins. Nolan is past the point in his career where he has something to prove. The love is gone and it's showing in a big way.The Batmobile was fun to watch, but that hardly makes a movie.Please look past the special effects and give this movie the rating it deserves. Make Nolan and other film-makers do more than throw gobs of money at ILM to make a movie."
7143,True,"The Dark Knight is for sure a good movie. It can easily be called the best Batman movie yet, although in my opinion thats not saying much. To be honest, there are just as many things to dislike about this movie as there are to enjoy.Just to summarize the things I liked about this movie: This is the smartest, darkest, complex, involving and violent Batman yet. There is no doubt that a lot of thought went into the plot movie. I really enjoyed how they made the Joker psychologically attack Batman and cause havok around the city. He really seemed like an intellectual villain who had a larger purpose than just killing Batman.My main complaints were that at some times, the movie takes its storyline a bit too far. I honestly thought the whole Two-Face origin was way too pushed. Harvey Dent's story arc seemed way too predictable and quite flat. I didn't really buy his whole transition into a villain. It seemed a little rushed and completely unnecessary and I think the movie could have done much better without the Two-Face side story.Plus I didn't like the whole ""Bruce Wayne turning himself in drama"". The story of the people turning against the hero has been overdone in the movies. It tries desperately to create some inner character turmoil for Batman, but 15 minutes later he is kicking ass like it never happened. Silly.Don't get me wrong, its a good movie. I just wish all the fans would see the movie for what it is and take their fan goggles off."
7144,True,"OK, I know my opinion may not be the most popular, but after recently watching the Dark Knight again, I am forced to air my grievances with this highly overrated, nonsensical farce of a film. It can certainly be entertaining, and Heath Ledger turned in an above average performance, for sure, but that is pretty much all this film has going for it. The plot has some gaping holes, the characters are paper-thin, the acting is atrocious, the writing falls flat, and the whole thing is entirely inconsistent.To unpack this a bit -- let's start with some of the glaring plot holes. The most noticeable one is right after the Joker crashes Bruce Wayne's little get together, and Batman jumps out the window after Rachel Dawes. OK, he got Dent out of sight and he rescued the girl, but what about the murderous villains that are still in his home threatening all of his guests? There is not even an attempt to explain this. Then there is the Joker's fortuitous luck -- he was expecting that robber to be standing in just the right spot to get hit by the bus? How does he escape from jail all of those times? He escapes by setting off a bomb? We see a shot of an explosion and then we see the Joker cruising down the street in a cop car. What? The whole Gordon faking his death thing is ludicrous, topped off by Gordon being in exactly the right place to put the shotgun to the Joker's head. Batman taking the blame at the end of the movie is also absurd -- Dent murdered 5 prominent people and Batman thinks that there will be no evidence at any crime scene to link them to Dent? I could keep going, but I think you get my point.As mentioned before, the characters are all paper thin, which was perfectly acceptable in the 1989 rendition of Batman, which was set in an entirely fictional world. The biggest problem here is that Christopher Nolan takes the same one dimensional characters and throws them into a realistic setting, making them much harder to swallow.I don't have much to say about the acting other than the fact that it made me die a little bit inside to see Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman turn in such awful performances. I did not expect much from the likes of Christian Bale, but I was positively shocked to see Morgan Freeman play such a flat, uninteresting role. Heath Ledger was certainly good, but I would have a hard time going so far as to call the performance great. If you want to see great, go pick up the Silence of the Lambs and watch Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, that is a great performance. Heath Ledger's Joker was good, but very far from great.Oh and as a side note: what is the time frame for the events of this film? A month? A year? It really seems like a random string of events, there is no sense of time passing or any sort of real things happening whatsoever. Again, in a less realistic setting (Tim Burton's Batman), this becomes irrelevant, but it is very important in a real world sort of setting as we see in the Dark Knight.All in all, this film was extremely inconsistent and entirely overrated. I would recommend that anyone who thinks that this movie was intelligent go out and rent 2001, the Godfather, and the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, and then compare them to this solid-gold turd."
7145,True,"I actually agree with almost every comment in the ""Hated It"" category. This was an enormously over-hyped and overblown flick - but apparently the explosion-and-violent-chase fans are rating as one of the greatest movies ever, despite a collection of plot holes that resembles the face of a tennis racket. I can understand their enthusiasm, but what was going through the minds of the professional reviewers??? I've seen them pick apart unto death much better flicks than this. Their bitch meters should have gone straight to the infrared, but instead they turned into pompon-wavers. Were they paid off? I have one extra comment on the plot. When the Joker is in police custody, one of the first things they would have done was wipe off all the clown makeup. Without it, this guy becomes a nothing - Samson without his hair. Then they just bury him in some out-of-state max security pen (and label him a child molester, by way of revenge), and all Gotham's troubles go back to same-old same-old. SSDD.Unlike most, I saw this movie first on DVD. It damn near drove me crazy: if I could get my hands around the neck of the Sound Director, he'd be dead meat. The explosions and demolition-derby car chases like to blow out the speakers on my TV - and then half the dialog is done at a virtual whisper! I practically wore out the volume buttons on my remote: up and down, up and down, ad infinitum. You want to sit back and just enjoy a movie, not have to continually stop it and go back because muting down the explosions caused you to miss the first five sentences of dialog. I dropped my vote three places just for this alone. It was THAT infuriating.As for the Oscars, Ledger's award HAD to be a sympathy vote. If he hadn't committed suicide (nobody can take that many different drugs accidentally), would he have even been nominated? His acting was pretty much just Jack Nicholson's Joker on angel dust. (Art imitating life???) Of course, the Academy keeps throwing statuettes at Nicholson, when in every role he's played he just played Jack Nicholson. He's got THAT character down pat."
7146,True,"Good movies should create ""the willing suspension of disbelief,"" meaning you forget that it's just actors and special effects. This movie failed to deliver that for me. I kept waiting for it to match the review hype but it only had random moments.The Eastwood/Devil voice of Batman needed explanation. It was too far off from his regular voice, like a crank caller. Was it just assumed to be an identity trick? It was hard to work up empathy for either Wayne or Batman. The best acting I've seen from C.B. was in ""The Machinist"" (a far more disturbing and better film than this).Excessive lesions on C.B. and M.G. were distracting in close-ups but that's not unique to this film. M.G. isn't what I would call hot, and it's unclear how she got to be the object of rich desires. She added a dowdy effect that dampened the felt urgency of certain things.Many special effects went beyond fantasy. Vehicle mass defied inertia laws in crashes; like the Bionic Man pushing a building. The bat-cycle was ludicrous in how it could blast every obstacle out of its way. The cellphone sonar was logistically absurd, if even technically possible. I like special effects with some chance of realism. The half face, half sinew thing was well done, but the sudden meanness of the D.A. seemed forced.I found the opening bank scene the most engrossing, promising part. The guy on the street corner dangling the mask had a spookiness I was expecting from the rest of the film, but it washed out. Where was all the ""darkness"" reviewers wrote of? I guess he kept kid audiences in mind. The Joker was well done but no more menacing than random creeps interrogated on C.S.I.Most importantly, the plot didn't feel naturally driven by events (see title of review). I think a rare combination of hype and the death of H.L. carried this film to a higher status than it deserved."
7147,True,"Like many a thing, keeping it simple is one way to make it good. As much as I loved Batman Begins, I disliked The dark Knight. The movie wanted to cram so many sub-plots into it that at some time I didn't know exactly where it was going. And is this movie really about Batman??? If it was, there are some features in it that made it look like a CHEAP Batman:1. OK, Wayne's manor was destroyed, blah blah. But making Batman roar out of a CONTAINER??? Can we make this any cheaper? An underground lair for Batman that seems to contain NOTHING but a table and a chair and a few other stuff???? Production could have made a little effort there, really... 2. Batman's costume, frankly didn't look THAT better than the Batman wanna-bes.And what's that fuss about dogs? Batman's costume isn't dog proof. It's bullet proof, fire-proof, shock-proof and nearly stupid-proof but please don't unleash the dogs on poor Batman... pathetic, really.The movie in itself does not lack action and blow-away special effects, but the storyline really lacks of substance. We see Batman in a supporting role, to do what others ask him to do, we don't see Batman as the leader and coming up with unexpected plans and twists - U gotta bring back the Chinese guy, OK I'll go. -U gotta save the hostages, I'll go. U gotta do this, do that? I'll go. Anything else? Tea or Coffee anyone?Not the best movie, at any cost. Not of the year nor of any time, sorry..."
7148,True,"Being a huge fan of superhero movies. Batman in particular has the right balance of amazing sound effects, score, visuals effects and all round action to keep my eyes glued to the screen and wanting more after the end of the film.While most films are so focused on big explosions and sometimes an overload of special effects, this film manages to deliver great dialogue in between the action scenes and in doing so setting a good pace for the action to follow.Going to recommend it to those who haven't see it yet. A definite must watch."
7149,True,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen!!! It has nothing to do with Batman and especially Joker!!!Joker is supposed to be a crazy,obsessed with money and vengeance villain who had an accident with chemicals! Not just an anarchist who doesn't like organizations and money and looks like homeless, with paint all over his face and some scars!Two-Face isn't supposed to die, he is supposed to be playing in another movie.And come on now, more people know who Batman is except Alfred, Batgirl and Robin?I am telling you this is not Batman."
7150,True,"Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' is a big and bold production. The great special-effects, sharp editing and affecting score sweep the film into a high-entertainment package. It is a vast improvement on Batman Begins reaching a higher level of storytelling. Although there are self-evident inadequacies in the script this is a breakthrough film. The Dark Knight is a long film, and in this respect it surprisingly fails somewhat to provide enough depth. Instead we do get scenes where the obvious ineptitude of the police enable the plot to continue as it wishes. For example, why is a police officer in the same cell as The Joker when it was entirely unnecessary? It therefore sometimes falls more into a comic book experience conflicting unfortunately with the superior film elements. However,if this can be forgiven (as I have) Nolan has produced a successful cross-over from his somewhat comic book feature of Batman Begins. Heath Ledger is stunning as The Joker providing the emotional context and thrills. The set-pieces are as grand as they are gripping.A minor point, which I could not get away from was a particular moment when Bale is discussing gadgets with Freeman, was this just me or did anyone else feel like we were watching a James Bond and Q moment?The Dark Knight is a breakthrough film it is more majestic and gripping than any of its Batman predecessors. It is a superior film of entertainment only hampered by its over long-running time but ultimately it is a triumph."
7151,True,"I suppose many people might be offended by the simple suggestion that this movie could be anything less than ""the best movie ever"" or perhaps just ""the best movie of 2008"", that it was merely okay, for superhero action drivel.But to me, that's what it was. It's the old good vs evil thing, the good billionaire dons latex suit to fight the evil for no apparent reason other than that he's the good guy, and the bad guy being ridiculously-over-the-top so, with a similarly solid rationale. Then there is the another good guy who has to experience a biographical kink in the form of a girlfriend blown to pieces and some cosmetically challenging facial events, and he becomes the semi-good guy. Lots of explosions, pseudo- technology, vehicles driving above the speed limit, lots of fighting, the end.I never really understood the appeal of the Batman franchise, which turned a unremarkable set of comic books (uh, ""graphic novels"") into an unremarkable series of movies. Yet, many people seem to love it, and consequently another one of those hit the streets, bigger, better, more expensive, and this time with an IMDb rating that even made me curious.To be sure, there are many interesting and impressive aspects of the movie. The director, for one---I very much enjoyed Memento, and give Nolan a lot of credit for it. The cast of The Dark Knight is nothing short of impressive, with certified talent such as Caine, Ledger, Oldman, Bale, and Eckhardt. And, of course, the special effects are great, the fights are well-choreographed and fast-paced, the cinematography is excellent, and so on. It is, no doubt, a technically well-executed action flick, which I suppose is all that it wants to be, and probably all most of the people seeing it in the cinema expect it to be.But it is also other things. Overlong, for instance. The trivial comic-book plot does not sustain 150 minutes of interest, its self-indulgent repetitiveness becoming boring quickly, the little character development happening in cartoonish hit-you-over-the-head-with-hamfisted-symbolism style, the rest being fights, battles, destruction, and some more fights. The range of excellent actors that make up the cast remains woefully underused, although we do get so see some excellent acting, most notably from Ledger and Oldman. Ledger's Joker, in particular, does not require a very broad range, but it's far out in the crazy and psychopathic part of the spectrum, and Ledger manages to turn a fairly ridiculous and cartoonish villain into a three-dimensional and utterly creepy character, which is testimony to his acting ability. By and large, however, one does get the feeling that performance per talent ratio isn't a very good one, and that this crowd could have been put to better use in a more grown-up production with less of a focus on expensive action sequences.Overall, this movie is way over-hyped for what it is, it's not among the top ten movies of all time in my book, but then neither is ""Shawshank Redemption"" or ""The Empire Strikes Back"". It does have its moments, though, but it could easily be cut down to 90 minutes."
7152,True,"My lack of faith in the audience is justified, how can this film be so highly rated when it's total garbage. Batman was my favourite comic book, the dark tortured hero really appealed to me. But this film really is a mess. Where do I begin? Probably the biggest problem of any bad movie, the characters.BATMAN The one we're supposed to identify with and feel his plight, is so wooden in this film that I could mistake him for a tree. Christian Bale's Batman seems devoid of any emotion or any internal plight, Plus in a film that is supposed to be about him, Batman seems relegated to a supporting role. In TDK he's merely a goon with a bad case of laryngitis. I know he's supposed to disguise his voice, but it's so over the top it's laughable. This is were Keaton and Conroy got it right, he seldom talks, when he does the voice change is subtle. Not sounding like a goon on a sugar high.The JOKER, The main villain. Heath Ledger's performance is good with what he's given, But the writing for the Joker is all wrong. Joker in this film is actually a very generic psychopath. If it wasn't for the make-up I would have never guessed it was supposed to be the Joker. The Joker isn't supposed to be a nihilist. Everything to him is a big joke, even murder has to be funny to him. Ledger's Joker lacking virtually any sense of humour, he's more akin to Jack the Ripper who seems to have an obsession with knives and scars. Also what put me off is how the Joker always looks physically ill. Constantly hunched over, waddling about, constantly licking and smacking his lips like his saliva is on overdrive. This simply doesn't work for a clownish criminal amusing himself.With the exceptions of Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, the actors in the film just seemed rather lazy. Like they wanted the film to end as quickly as possible and collect their pay cheque. Why in a film where characters are supposed to be the central focus be so wooden and one dimensional with them. The film flops completely on it's characters The directing was equally sloppy. A lot of pointless noise and generic action scenes that seem to be put in as filler in order to extend the film to the 150 minute mark. Excessive cuts that make the action difficult to follow and often in poor light where we can't see anything. Equally pointless was the plot, in fact it's more a collection of subplots, none of them with any closure or resolution to them. With the sloppy cuts, it also leaves enough plot holes to sink this film into an incoherent mess.Yet I hear this film heralded as a masterpiece, I see critics and fan reviews who just gush over this film. Has the standard of film making really reached this low? 20 years ago, a film called Robocop came out. A very silly concept at it's core, but the characters are what made the film work. We could identify with Robocop ironically enough.Tim Burton's despite it's plot flaws, The characters were well created and acted and kept to the spirit of the source material. TDK has no such redeeming features."
7153,True,"First I'll say, if you're one for the story and the 'why' of a character, in this movie, you will be disappointed. It was not the directors goal to explain everything about every character, and wanted to show the story instead. I feel that the story went along nicely. Most movies, I look at my watch, I'm not a movie person, this movie did NOT feel like 2 1/2 hours at all. I feel that Aaron Eckharts transformation from Harvey Dent to Two Face sucked. He didn't play Two Face up good enough... they had developed him as too much of a good guy, and didn't seem able to throw himself into the 'bad' Two face role. He needed to be more tormented when talking... more dramatic. He fell short as Two Face IMO. Ledgers Joker was perfect. He lost himself in that role. Sometimes when watching, you can see an actor through the part.. and that was not the case here. All you saw was Joker... crazy, funny, quirky Joker. Oscar worthy? maybe."
7154,True,"I'm not sure why people think it's so great.A lot of people talk about this being Heath Ledger's last movie. People... not only was he working on another movie... THAT Movie had decided to use his footage, so when it comes out THAT will be his last movie.Do people think it is ""dark"" because it is mistakenly believed Heath Died because of this movie? (Even though it has already been proved to not be true.)Cause I've seen cartoons that are ""darker"" theme wise. Last night I saw an anime on Scifi that was more twisted than this movie. This movie really wasn't as dark and twisted as they made it out to be... and considering most of the violence is suggested rather than seen, People can't say this is the most violent movie out there.Also, why did the guy who played batman feel he had to talk as if he had Laryngitis or Bronchitis or something? Every time he talked when he was in ""Batman"" costume, people started giggling.Another problem was that it went on FOREVER. It went on and on and on and on. I walked out. I'm not sure how much longer there was to the movie. But once the Joker was caught by Batman, and you thought it was coming to an end... in comes ""two Face"" with Commissioner Gordon's kidnapped family. I had had enough by then.The plus sides: I like Michael Caine. Glad to see him in the movie.I have always had a crush on Gary Oldman The makeup they did on Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) after he became 2-face was brilliant.And I liked what they did with the joker, to a point. But for what it was, Heath did a good job.However, I have to give this movie an over all D.It was too long, Too boring, Too long, Too hyped, and Give Batman a cough drop for pete's sake!!"
7155,True,"I'm pretty serious about this one because I love movies. And since this movie is being rated as the best movie of all time, I was expecting something that could measure itself with the great movies of all time. I expected a movie that grips you, crawls under your skin and leaves you breathless. It does none of that. It is pretentious and inconsistent. It pretends to dig deep and dark and explore themes like morality, fate, good versus evil, heart versus mind, madness versus reason, and at the same time it wants to be this big spectacular action movie. But it fails miserably. It's all just a big clumsy pretentious inconsistent mess.Yes, Ledger is good, but for his performance to really contribute to the movie, there should have been context. If the rest just doesn't feel right, it looses its potential. If you throw a diamond on a mountain of poop, it doesn't change much of the way it looks or smells. Love interest Maggie Gyllenhaal (great performance in Stranger than Fiction) produces no chemistry at all, so I wasn't really blown away when she was blown up. Editing feels weird. But most of all it was the inconsistencies that got to me. And then not just the 'practical' ones (like the inconsistent protective quality of the batman suit; or why leave an extremely dangerous criminal unrestrained with a tubby policeman in his cell ('hostage volunteer? you, tubby?'); a schoolbus is used twice to make a grand escape? - do they come with teleporter machines these days?; why would you want to ride your batmobile face down?; Batman lowers his voice to be unrecognizable, but how hard is it to follow a batmobile with a helicopter to its hiding place?), but more importantly it's crucial plot/ morality inconsistencies. Yes, the White Knight went through some traumatic experiences, but to turn to the dark side so wholeheartedly and sadistically? And then to just let the Joker (at least indirectly responsible for his trauma) walk when he only needs to pull the trigger? Oh yeah, forgot, he's Mr. Coin Toss now. But even if he is guided by blind fate now, he still determines himself who he goes after and whether it's OK to threaten to blow out the brains of little kids. And then the Big Bad criminal who throws the detonator out off the window. Ah! The Joke is on you Joker! People are not what you make them out to be. Even the baddest bad ass has a good heart. Never mind that just before when the Joker threatened to blow up a hospital unless an innocent lawyer was killed, there was a crowd with guns ready to shoot the guy within no time. Also, what with the vote on the 'good people boat'? They vote to blow up the 'bad people' (democracy at its finest) but then Nobody has the balls to do it? So they don't blow up the other boat because they think it's unjust, but because they're spineless hypocrites.I applaud movies that try and deal with complex issues like conflicting emotions or morals, but to just make a big soup of it all under the pretense of 'but that's how life works, it's conflicting ideas, feelings and actions' is just a weak excuse for the inability or laziness to produce a good consistent story. Believe me, I detest black and white thinking and applaud the exploration of the Grey area. But that's not what this movie does. Piling a bunch of random inconsistent ideas on top of each other is not equal to exploring the Grey area.The climax is the ending though (it usually is). Our dark knight has to sacrifice himself, has to live like a hunted animal in the shadow, because the People would not be able to cope with the idea of Denth doing bad things, despite his recent traumas. So it's better to LIE to the public, because they are too stupid to make up their own mind and their faith in goodness of man would be lost forever (despite the fact that they just tried to establish with the boat-thing that there's goodness even in big bad criminals). So Batman (whose enemies take advantage of the fact that he doesn't kill) takes the blame for a bunch of random killings that could have been linked to anyone - a Joker perhaps? (even if they wanted to absolve Denth from his crimes -I mean, evidence/motive would have been needed to link it to Batman too?) and goes off running ('run Forrest!') into the night to save us another day. Because you just can't trust people to make up their own mind, it's better to lie to them. It's for their own good. Great morale. Straight from the White House? But ey, why so serious?"
7156,True,"This is one of the worst movies ever made. If you think that it will be as good a the original I urge you to never watch this. Heaths over the top ridiculous performance as the joker was not Oscar worthy, but they gave it to him because he died and robbed him in Brokeback Mountain. The use of the Harvey character was pathetic and Christian Bale is one of the wost actors to ever play Batman. His Bruce Wayne is the only redeeming quality of the movie, other than Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordan. The whole movie is trying to be more epic than it is and this leads to a terrible storyline and pathetic use of special effects. I would recommend watching the original batman with Michael Keaton any day. Don't waste your time with this crap written by Nolan, he is a hack. Unless you like Batman sounding like he is Satan... don't watch this film"
7157,True,"If I could give this movie less than a 1, I would certainly do that. I had read and heard so much about it that I was sure this would be a defining work of numbing minds to make a bad story look good with cheap tricks. I was game and we thought it can't be as bad as the critics said - you know critics. Sure enough... Give me a break with the awful acting (OK excluding Heath..), horrible camera work, poor use of the budget (that has been mentioned over and over again). I've seen better on films with smaller budgets that are 100 times better. It's the Director and the Producer that makes films work - they choose the teams. That's it. If they don't put it together and make it work...it simply won't. So, they didn't - and it doesn't. Worst part is that I know this group can do good work... I just had to take the time to write this review...though I'm sure the film crew and the half crazed fans doesn't appreciate this review - I hope I'm doing you all a favor with my wish for you to do well. Good luck. Final Word: The polar opposite of Batman Begin's awesomeness."
7158,True,"I know people will hate me for giving this movie 2 stars, but allow me to explain why the rating is deserved. I watched this movie twice and my initial impression of it was confirmed on the second viewing. The tagline of the movie is ""Welcome to a world without rules."" But even someone who likes the movie must realize this is absurd, because the rules of the film are strictly defined from the start. Batman is PERFECT GOOD, and the Joker is PERFECT EVIL. Whenever it's the cops versus Batman in this movie, we know the cops are wrong and Batman is on the side of good. He's just that good. And the Joker is so evil that he doesn't even have a motive. He's there to create a force of perfect chaos which Batman is duty-bound to fight.To deny that this movie is about terrorism is to deny the well-executed thrill elements such as the videos released to the press and closed-circle moral tests (on the ferries; similar to United 93). These are borrowed directly from the terrorist playbook, and one persistent element, the ticking time-bomb scenario which Batman solves by brutally beating people up until he gets the information he wants, is derived from our fear of terrorism even though ticking time-bombs NEVER happen in real life. When you compare the movie to reality, though, an outrageous discrepancy is made evident. Terrorists are not born psychopaths like the Joker. They are poor, scared people driven to violence only by persistent reinforcement of hatred and duty. That's WHY there are no ticking time-bombs: true psychopaths do not act like the Joker, and terrorists are not true psychopaths.In this movie, the only mistake Batman makes is when he injures himself swerving his motorcycle so that he doesn't kill the Joker. He is just too good to kill his enemy. Three thousand years of storytellers are laughing themselves to tears in Heaven at our image of a hero. Read Shakespeare. Read the Iliad. See if you can figure out for yourself what kind of travesty this is.The areas where this film deviates from standard superhero crap only condemn it further. Batman creates a magical cell phone network, which his buddy says a violation of privacy; the film makes his buddy out to be a spineless coward, because Batman needs his magic to do good. Do you see the problem here? Here it is: Batman doesn't exist in real life.To call this movie the best film of the year, or, as IMDb currently reckons it, the best film of all time, is to admit that we want to believe in a world where good battles evil. It creates a worldview where ""good"" people will not have to admit their own problems, and ""evil"" people can be rounded up and beaten half to death without any moral qualms. It is EXACTLY this kind of mentality which has caused the war in Iraq, Abu Ghraib, and Guantanamo Bay.I award this movie eight stars for execution, but subtract five stars for its incorrect, dehumanizing, and morally stunted outlook on human nature. Thus, it ends up with three stars, which I think is more than generous."
7159,True,"To think that this movie belongs in the top 100 movies of all time let alone the top five is ludicrous. You bet, it' quite a spectacle. But spectacle doesn't make a great movie. There's one truly great character and everyone knows it's Heath Ledger's Joker. That was a magical paring of great writing and great acting.But what happened to the rest of the movie? Besides The Joker the film is merely almost good. That is if you like exceedingly dark and depressing movies that have little if anything to feel good about. It's mildly suspenseful at times but much of the action is telegraphed. Let's see some more stupid police who can't see another Joker getaway coming from a mile away.I'm no wimp -- I can be engrossed by and accept wholesale carnage when it's in something like ""Saving Private Ryan"" -- but this is yet another movie in which it doesn't matter how many faceless civilians and police die just as long as there can be lots of shooting and car crashes and the stars are OK.And what of poor Batman? Christian Bale does a creditable job in the role, yet this is really a movie about The Joker. The hero and who he is isn't nearly as well explored as the villain.Besides Ledger the two old pros, Michael Cain and Morgan Freeman, play the most interesting characters. Gary Oldman does a decent job as James Gordon. The problem is we're never given any reason to doubt him yet there is this undercurrent to the character that maybe he's not really working for the good guys.The scene where Batman hunts The Joker as SWAT teams come crashing into the building is one of the most confusing messes I've seen. There's no clear idea what's happening and why and The Joker's final capture is anticlimactic. The turn to the dark side by character Harvey Dent is poorly developed and in the final scenes, lacking much logic. And the suspension of logic -- especially when it comes to the evil doing of The Joker -- just goes too far.In the end, despite Batman's expected saving of the child, the movie simply peters out with a muddled message and Batman zooming off on his motorcycle in the direction of -- we can only presume -- another sequel.If you want a dark, action-packed film then see ""Quantum of Solace."" It's not a great film -- not nearly as good as ""Casino Royal"" -- but it's a fair shot better than ""The Black Knight."""
7160,True,"It starts with a pretty good story line, and good characters, Batman, the mob, the joker, and the attorney are all OK. There are great actions scenes, the kidnapping ""over the air"" in Hong Kong is really cool. But after the half of the movie, it turns down: the attorney's girl friend gets killed, OK, and he gets crazy, after 20 years fighting crime, he doesn'st know about casualties? in front of the gangster, he shoots his driver: non-sense! he kidnappes the most honest cop's family: non-sense! voting for survival in the boats : total non-sense! and what do excellent actors like Oldman, Caine, Freeman in such a waste ? Sorry, i'd like my money back.."
7161,True,"I've never read any Batman comics, I only saw the films and few episodes from the excellent animated series when I was about 10. Batman '89 is still one of my favorite movies (mainly because of emotional reasons), along with Batman Begins which was a very good movie too. I was really hyped about The Dark Knight and like Batman Begins, it is a very, very good movie, though not the best. Let's start with the cons first.CONS Two and a half hours were a bit long for me, they could have done it in 2 hours and it still would have had this same resonance with the audiences IMO. Two unnecessary story lines: Mr. Reese and Hongkong, especially Hongkong. It was a nice little sequence, but not too important.Batman's voice: Too much, I almost laughed.Scarecrow: the character deserved so much more than what he finally got, I hope he'll be back for the third ride. He was a real threat to Batman in the first movie.Rachel: now I believe it was the character itself all along, not Katie Holmes. She simply didn't work, I'm kinda glad she's out.Music: most of the time it was excellent, but it annoyed the hell out of me in some places.PROS Greatly crafted story, full of twists and turns, though I felt a definite anti-climax during the ending sequences. A wanted a bigger showdown between the Batman and the Joker, I guess the writers wanted to save that for another movie.Christian Bale's Batman: apart from his growling voice, very, very good like in Batman Begins, though I think he should have got more screen time.Aaron Eckhart's Harvey/Two-Face: the real steal of the show, he was bloody brilliant. I hope he'll also be back for the third movie as the main baddie, his Two-Face was very threatening.Heath Ledger's Joker: I won't go into details, but I guess the greatest compliment I could give him is that I hated the Joker, I couldn't stand this psychopath.Gary Oldman's Jim Gordon: He was Gary Oldman. Enough said.:) Brilliant and the character was very well written.Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine were superb as well, so the cast was top-notch.SUMMARY So, the film was very good, but not great (only in my opinion!!! Fans, don't shoot me!). The Dark Knight is NOT a comic book movie, perhaps that's the reason I'm not as thrilled about it as other people (which DOESN'T mean the film isn't excellent), for me the concept of Batman doesn't really work in the real world as it worked in Burton's fantastic Gotham. But comparisons with Batman '89 are kinda fruitless, the styles are so different, it's impossible for me to decide which is better. Like the Ledger vs. Nicholson debate. Nicholson's Joker worked perfectly in Burton's version as did Ledger's in Nolan's, the two universes could coexist together perfectly.7 and a half out of 10. I want a third movie right away with Scarecrown and Two-Face (I hope the latter didn't die).:)"
7162,True,"People who know and study FILM will all have the same basic review of this MOVIE. It's overacted (and yes, Heath Ledger is included in that remark) and just an overall horrible script. The whole ""why so serious"" bit was again, overacted, and SO predictable. I wrote better dialogue when I was a toddler. Then comes the completely unfathomable events - Nolan wanted the movie to be realistic but he clearly is a moron for that statement because only pre-teens and people pretending to go along with the hype would believe the whole cell phone bomb inside a guy's stomach. And a gun in court? COME ONE STOP INSULTING ME! The fact that this movie is ANYWHERE in the top 250 proves that people are generally stupid."
7163,True,"Soon after watching the Dark Knight, I decided that it does not belong in IMDb's top 250 greatest movies of all time. It's a problem with IMDb. The minute a popular film hits the box office, what does it do? It skyrockets to the top 250. Of course, this happens because, whenever a big blockbuster first comes out, people get all hyped up about it and rate it 10 stars. They hardly ever take the time to recognize any faults that may be in the film. They just jump to conclusions to call it ""a masterpiece"" and ""best movie of the year."" Now I too had looked forward to this movie for a while. I really enjoyed Batman Begins, and saw all of the other Batman films. The Dark Knight takes what was originally a cheesy comic book concept and tries to turn it into a big-budget crime thriller. It doesn't exactly make the transition. Because of this, the whole film turns out to be contradictory. At no point does the atmosphere jibe with the source material. The Dark Knight is also much too long and it isn't even that engaging. I wanted to like it but found myself wanting it to be over already halfway through. The way it is structured is also very sloppy and disjointed. It's just one outrageous scene after another. The movie doesn't have a whole lot to offer apart from a great performance from Ledger. I feel that Batman is very weak in this film as a character, compared to Batman Begins. The Joker really dominates the entire film, not leaving much room for Batman's character to be developed. Batman also speaks in a growl throughout this film. Yes, I know this was intended, but it is not very menacing, nor intimidating, but quite ridiculous. And it is made worse by the fact that the Joker is only character in the movie who poses much of a substantial threat.Christian Bale is alright as Batman in this movie, but his performance is really dwarfed by that of Heath Ledger. Morgan Freeman is great as he almost always is--best acting in the whole film (besides Heath Ledger). Maggie Gyllenhall is mediocre in this movie, and I found myself not sympathizing with her character at all. She's just another wooden character. Gary Oldman is alright. Michael Caine is good, but I have seen him do better. Aaron Eckhart is very competent at playing his characters (Two-face and Harvey Dent).But it is pretty unbelievable how brutal he turns out to be, compared to his cordial personality in the beginning. The Dark Knight has one very good scene which is the hospital scene, in which Two-face looks at his coin and finds it has half its side burned, just like his his face. I was very impressed with this scene. In my opinion, it is the one part of the movie that has any depth or symbolism. But I found many scenes in the movie to be poorly done, including the scenes with the Joker escaping from the prison, and the scenes with Batman on the motorcycle. These scenes rely on expensive special effects to compensate for a story that isn't very compelling.Also, the scene with the two ships at the end is way too long, far-fetched, and really just a poor scene overall. The movie flows somewhat until this point, but this scene is just intrusive and irrelevant to the movie. The whole scene is very anti-climatic and interrupting. Overall, I'd say The Dark Knight is OK as far as summer blockbusters go, but that's really not saying much. For many, the movie is made watchable by a great performance by Ledger, high-end special effects, and first-rate production value, but, for this viewer, the shoddy writing ruins its chances of ever becoming great. The Dark Knight isn't so disappointing that I would ask you not to watch it; it's probably worth watching if you really like Batman. I do not ask you to side with my negative opinion of the film, as I am of the minority. However, I do ask you to not blindly fall for the hype, as so many have done, and to acknowledge the faults present in the film. Thank you."
7164,True,"I'm probably one of the last people in the world to see this movie, and I'm glad I didn't spend $10+ to see it in the theaters. Technically, the effects are amazing, and Heath Ledger does give a very good performance as The Joker (though crazy people are the easiest characters to portray IMHO). My issues with the film are: Batman resorts to physical torture in several scenes. The Batman I know would scare criminals, mostly through the fear of the mysterious ""bat man"". However, dropping a crime boss off a building to break his ankles is pretty extreme, and even his treatment of The Joker in the interrogation room is over the top.The film has too many plot lines...romance triangle, Two Face, both add extra baggage. The ""Two Face"" story line (coupled with a love triangle) could be a film on its own. And how about the Wayne Enterprises employee who was going to reveal Batman? Plot holes galore....I can suspend my disbelief and let Batman ""fly"", but how can the Joker sneak explosives into hospitals and ferry boats in MASSIVE quantities without anyone noticing? Too long by about 30 minutes. If they had trimmed a few plot lines it might have worked better.So enjoyable to watch, and probably a 7 rather than a 5, but I feel I need to vote down a bit to offset all the crazy 10 ratings."
7165,True,"I will admit, when I first saw The Dark Knight, I was blown away. However, after repeated viewings at parties, I noticed things that were corny or unnecessary, and some things that didn't make sense at all. I will explain exactly why this film deserves almost none of the ridiculous amounts of acclaim it has received since it's release.I will start off by saying that Heath Ledger gave a career-making performance in The Dark Knight. Though he was an incredible actor, I sincerely think that he never would have been able to top the Joker. This role stands out to me along with my other personal favorites, such as Hannibal Lecter (The Silence of the Lambs), Andy Dufresne (The Shawshank Redemption), Annie Wilkes (Misery), etc.The opening bank heist scene was the last real interesting moment of The Dark Knight. Seeing goons with clown masks robbing a massive New York bank definitely grabbed my attention. When the Joker was revealed, with his face-paint and devious smile, I was drawn in. But, after that moment, the film mugged me and left me standing in the rain.The Dark Knight was an involving, but not an overtly moving film. The story was nothing more than an amalgam of action/superhero film clichés, bland supporting characters, and weird technology, snowballed into one, giant of a Hollywood blockbuster, fueled by one great performance and a few cool fight scenes.Harvey Dent has earned himself a full paragraph in this comment. I... Hate... Aaron Eckhart. This mediocre actor does not look like, sound like, or act like a person that could be associated with a film such as The Dark Knight. He simply lacked the morally twisted personality of the Harvey Dent that the film depicts. Also, what they did with ""Two-Face"" as far as character origin really irked me. I realize that Chris Nolan wanted to stray from the original batman films, but leaving the scarred by acid concept untouched wouldn't have hurt the film any. Harvey's resulting injuries were unrealistic and ultimately unbelievable. (His eyes and teeth were not discolored or mutilated in any way, which is impossible for the amount of flesh missing from his face, and he would have succumbed to crippling infection within an hour of leaving the hospital.) The line at the end of the film, spoken by the Joker, really hit me on a physiological level. He said, ""This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets and immovable object."" This is a reference to Gotham's blaming of Batman for murders and accusing him of being a menacing vigilante, and also their turning to him for help when the Joker overruns the film. This message is a deep one indeed, though I think that Mr. Nolan had wasted it, along with his superb directing talent, on an utterly stolid film.In summation, The Dark Knight was not a terrible film, it is just vastly over-hyped. In the technical aspects, such as cinematography and sound, it excels tremendously. However, to say that it is a masterpiece of American cinema is highly inaccurate, and to place at number SEVEN on the top 250 list is both ignorant and disrespectful to all of the great films that it outranked. I recommend you watch The Dark Knight, as you will probably like it much more than I did, but, if you are like me, you will walk away remembering nothing but the Joker's demented laugh and a plethora of explosions."
7166,True,"And thus it has been watched; one of the most talked about movies of latter years. The crowning achievement of Nolas career and the apex of Heath ledgers movie history. So is it worth the praise? Does it live up to the expectations set? In short, no. In long: Noooooooooooooooo. The Dark Knight should, at heart, be about Batman and his eternal nemesis the Joker. But Nolans uneven film-making assures this is not the case; The movie has more subplots than three full seasons of ""Days of our Lives""; and most of the subplots feels as relevant as that show. To put it simply: This movie tried to put too much into too short a time. To move on to more specific details: The story has enough plot holes to sink Titanic; How does the Joker finance his operations when he seems unwilling to use cash? How does he get an army of loons to work as a cohesive and highly fanatical religious unit? How does he smuggle vast amounts of explosives onto two boats and one hospital? Another weak point is bad acting and just stupid plot movement; Bale is excellent as Bruce Wayne, he is however horrible as Batman. His completely hilarious attempt at distorting his voice sounds like a severe case of throat cancer. It is of little consequence however as he's delegated to the role of sidekick anyway. The actor who played Harvey Dent is in the long run pointless; He is of TV-quality and can't handle his role .Then again, he does it better than Tommy Lee Jones did. Gary Oldman has something of a broken look over him; he seems to wish out of the movie as soon as possible. Michael Caine as Alfred isn't that good compared to the old Alfred, but he suffices. Morgan Freeman does what he does best; Speaks with an authoritative voice.And now..To the name of the movie: Heath Ledger, who's untimely death has elevated him to the sort of cult status only death celebrities gets. WHich is unfortunate for while he was a good actor his role here is NOT that good. His version of the Joker is decent, but looses itself in some sort of misguided attempt at realism. In the end the only thing it manages to come across as is boring. The Joker is realistic, and yet gifted with overwhelming superpowers which allows him to do pretty much everything he sets his mind too. And I mean anything; Build up a criminal empire strictly on IOU notes? Check. Smuggle several tons of explosives into what one can be assumed is heavily guarded ferries? Check. Do the same to a major hospital? Check. Convince the man who's wife to be he just murdered brutally that he isn't responsible because he's just ""A dog""? Check. Damnit, this guy could probably convince Batman that he really does have feelings for Robin.Overall TDK is a uneven movie: It is hampered by poor acting, lousy effects and a horrible script. But it has some bright spots in mood and overall theme. In the end, it isn't enough and I cannot for the life of me understand why this movies is hailed as the second coming of Christ."
7167,True,"THE DARK KNIGHT is ALL hype and no substance! I've seen it 3 times and it is just plain awful. Basically, it is too long and convoluted as all get out. It felt 4 hours long to me the first time I saw it...no kidding! I guess the confusing part is worse than the long part. If a film flows smoothly for its run, length ought not be an issue, but TDK is utterly messy and confusing for it's running time. So Nolan wants a REALISTIC version of BATMAN? Then explain SOME things to us! The big one is HOW DOES JOKER SET ALL THIS STUFF UP?At least BATMAN BEGINS was grounded in realism, explained motivations, techniques, and plans, and had a aura of realism. After BB was over, I remember thinking I LIKED THIS MOVIE! Although I'm a Burton Batman fan, I admit that Nolan did a very good job with BB; it feasibly defined a realistic Batman world while still embodying a sense of fun and had a lot of entertainment value. And the plot made sense! But after TDK was over, my impression was WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT? Some points about why TDK is a weak film to me: *Harvey Dent swallows all that gasoline and isn't even sick enough to hurl! He is badly burned, but his rage and need for vengeance dulls his pain and he easily walks around and does not scare the Bejesus out of anyone? NO ONE is shocked by the way he looks! Seriously, Nolan?*Gordon and Batman decide that Dent/TwoFace will be a hero and no one will know that he killed 5 people. EXCEPT for them, Gordon's family, and that bad cop Ramirez! I'm sure they will ALL keep it a secret...Plothole! *Maggie Gyllenhall as Rachel Dawes not attractive! Katie Holmes from BB wasn't jaw-droppingly gorgeous, but she WAS fairly easy on the eyes! And Holmes worked much better in this role in BB, had a LOT more chemistry with Bale, and had an important function to the story. When Joker says that she (Gyllenhall's Rachel) is a beautiful woman, I was like, NO SHE'S NOT! Gyllenhaal is perhaps a better actress than Holmes, but Holmes was actually much more right for the role of Rachel Dawes. Gyllenhaal literally has nothing to do and just doesn't cut it in TDK. *Lucius Fox (played by Morgan Freeman, who just exists in this film, nothing else) has the ability to do ANYTHING technological? This includes constructing a sonar device that can scan all 30 million cell phones in Gotham City simultaneously. Or did Bruce Wayne in his very limited technological training and experience do it? Either way...OK. Yeah. Right. Whatever. In BB, the stuff Fox was selling Wayne at least seemed plausible. In TDK, it comes off as just plain absurd technobabble!*Batman and Joker get the crap beat out of them repeatedly, chewed up by dogs, fall from multiple story buildings and don't even get hurt. When Batman saved Rachel, they fell from the penthouse of a CHICAGO high-rise for cripe's sake. That must have been 100 stories easy! No bones broken, no trauma, just ho-hum, back to business.*That climactic ferry boat scene is pure de Hollywood manipulation! It is there solely to reel the viewer in to make it seem like TDK is some kind of original, provocative piece. Instead, it comes across as sappy, maudlin, and empty. The ending to that scene is soooooo predictable! *In general, though, TDK is choppily edited, is populated with one-dimensional, lifeless characters, is humorless, convoluted as heck, has dull dialogue, and is VERY cliché. I mean, it's barely even a DECENT movie!Christian Bale was great in BB, but in TDK, Nolan's hack direction and the script really let him down, making him look like a laughingstock as a hero. He was barely even in TDK and when he was in it, you didn't get any feel for the character so well-established in BB. What makes Bruce Wayne/Batman tick? What does he really want? Just based on one dinner where Dent spouts about being a crusader, Wayne thinks that he's THE ONE, the savior of Gotham City? Not very deep character development. In addition to Freeman, you have Michael Caine as Wayne's butler/accomplice Alfred, Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon, and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, all giving rather lifeless performances. Ironically, I think Eckhart has the biggest male role in the film, but unfortunately Dent is not very accessible and rather empty to the viewer. Really, Bale shares lead honors with Oldman, Eckhart, and Ledger; actually, Oldman and Eckhart may have bigger roles in this than Bale and Ledger! Who wants a Batman flick where neither Batman (the main hero) nor the Joker (the main villain) have the biggest role? These skilled actors are unfortunately operating from a vapid script and extremely short-sighted character development.Tim Burton's surrealistic, neo-noir, skewed, artsy, comic book BATMAN flicks (BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS) are truly the best Batman movies. We accept at face value those films because Burton's unique vision not only strived for something different for a superhero movie, but also succeeded in a way that Nolan's films just cannot. Batman the bad guy who is hated by the entire city of Gotham?!. No way, not in superhero world, not acceptable! And I don't care what these nouveau moviegoers so enthralled with this film think!"
7168,True,"This is the second worst film I have ever paid to see in a cinema. (The worst was Zoolander) Where to begin? The ersatz brooding music, the inane plot, the ""heavyweight philosophical dilemma"" posed by the two ferries episode, the overacting, the deeply pathetic ending. There was much made in the British press about its violent content, and the (un)suitability of its certificate - after seeing it all I can say is I didn't find the violence objectionable, but emerged thinking that perhaps a new certificate is needed for the irredeemably crap. Avoid!The tragedy of this, and what personally makes me angry, is that directors like Loach and Leigh could probably have made ten films on this budget, even someone more expensive and supremely talented in the fantasy genre like Gilliam or del Torro could have made several. What a waste."
7169,True,"This is one of the most over rated pieces of $hit I've ever had the misfortune of watching.Went to the cinema to see this when it came out and was bored $hitless. Only now do I have the patience and calm to write a review.Well done to the makers of the movie for exploiting Heath Ledgers death to the maximum to push this movies appeal to the general public.Christopher Nolan is a hack director in my opinion. Scene upon pointless scene of boring tedious dialogue. Scenes that drag and drag going nowhere.Christian Bale was utterly dire as Batman. Not only was the voice he put on absurd, but he just doesn't suit Batman end of story.Heath Ledger, while a competent actor, was NOTHING special as The Joker. Yet again, another over rated aspect of this movie-his performance. It was mediocre.THe plot is ludicrous with The Joker planting bombs without getting caught etc.THats another thing I'd like to mention. Chris Nolan tapped into a bit of terrorism here....9/11 anyone? Don't tell me none of you noticed this. What a total cop out. Lets get the American viewers attention by throwing in a bit of 9/11 themed stuff.After the film ended, I was really angry that I had been charged an extortionate amount of my hard earned money to watch this garbage.What was worse was having to read and hear about the raving reviews of this total mess of a film.To hell with all the fan-boys who will defend this plastic pretentious charade at all costs.Who gives a flying phuck how much money it made, it was utter $hit."
7170,True,"Ledger gives a powerful performance as the joker, but the rest of the movie was a bit out of focus. Surprisingly the movie revolves around Harvey Dent. ""The White Knight"" Unfortunately Eckhart was bland as Harvey Dent and his fall to the dark side was almost corny. Shame really as this was Harvey Dent's story rather than Batman's. Speaking of which, I have never seen Christian Bale act this poorly. The man is one of the greatest actors of his generation and now his performance was totally uninspired. The Batman voice is incredibly distracting and as Bruce Wayne he just sleepwalks through his scenes. I also noticed that he wasn't as buff as he was in Begins. In all honesty there wasn't much for him to do here though. The script simply doesn't give Batman much to do, other than fight and beat up people. Bruce Wayne is the billionaire Playboy and that's about it. Freeman and Cain virtually play the same character. They do it well but the cast is too bloated already so they don't get much screen time.Maggie Gyllenhaal was great. She was able to bring warmth to her portrayal of Rachel Dawes. But unfortunately we don't get to see much of her either.The philosophical themes in this movie are barely explored. Every hero turns into a villain? Or some such nonsense. Every firefighter will turn evil unless they die? Very shallow and laughable. Only Jokers nihilistic speeches were convincing. Every good hearted person either dies or gets horribly mutilated. And then turns to evil. Batman beats prisoners and brakes peoples legs. Why so violent? Then you have your boring action sequences, the mandatory car chases and numerous explosions. The Dark Knight is actually an action movie much like Die Hard. Only the nihilistic philosophy sets it apart and gives it a unique flavor. If you are a big action movie fan you'll probably enjoy this movie. The Dark Knight isn't as good as Batman Begins. Batman Begins was a character study. How a traumatized young boy became a hero and how he turned his anger and fear into something positive. Here we see the hero corrupted by Joker. He is violent and angry. No longer a hero. He is willing to lie to the people of Gotham because they couldn't handle the truth. This sends a dubious message.In fact this movie has way more propaganda than your average summer blockbuster. Invading privacy, torturing prisoners and lying to the public.... But It's cool cause it's Batman. Kids wanna be like Batman and therefore Batman is cool even while torturing prisoners. Dark Knight could be viewed as legitimizing Dick Cheney's War on terror. It's pretty disgusting. ""We have to work the Dark side...""- Mr Cheney said after 911. Batman agrees."
7171,True,"I think its adorable that certain members of an unspecified generation find ""The Dark Knight"" (aka Batman 2) to be a Masterpiece of Contemporary Cinema. Is 'adorable' the right word? Christian Bale reprises his role as the humorless comic-book hero and Heath Ledger joins the cast as the humorless comic-book villain ironically named ""Joker."" Ledger's ""Joker"" is about as much fun as an emergency spleenectomy, which means to say he never laughs, never makes anyone laugh, and never jokes. Are we having fun yet? The film takes place in the same Gotham City from the previous film: flat, bleak, black, dark, foreboding, menacing, pessimistic, intense, sinister, colorless, numb, petrified... is this the fun part? Bale- an otherwise fascinating actor- manages to create a black hole as both Bruce Wayne AND Batman, leaving the audience without any protagonist for whom to cheer. Christopher Nolan's solemn direction is the same as in the first- he's working so hard to convince us that all of this is ABSOLUTELY REAL that there is no chance for any fun. Fun in a superhero movie? I must be out of my mind.What's sad is that poor Heath Ledger took the role of Actual Psychotic so seriously that it contributed to the man's death. No film role is worth your life, and if playing the villain in a comic book movie messes with your mind, you're doing it wrong. No offense to the late actor- whose performance here would have been great in a dramatic or psychological film- but Jack Nicholson nailed The Joker in '89. It was nice of the Academy to give Ledger the posthumous Oscar, but I think we all would have preferred he not die before his time.This is not to say the movie is terrible... it's still an above-average action flick with some nice moments: the sunset prison transfer is beautifully done and the scenes at Wayne's cocktail party border on subversive, but the generally dour approach to the popcorn-flick leaves me depressed, and I can't help returning to the thought that a man gave his life for this...Maybe that's what certain members of an unspecified generation want... maybe the Imagination is so damaged they don't believe a movie character is killed unless an actor really dies. I find the death of creative thought rather frightening, and I keep coming back to an old horror catchphrase: ""It's only a movie, It's only a movie..."" GRADE: C"
7172,True,"Forget all the hype of it being the best film ever and it being the best film of 2008 and Heath Ledger being fantastic. None of these things are true. Yes the film is good, bordering on very good. But that's it, no way is it as great as everyone is making out. Let's start at the beginning the story, the story is just not involving enough, there's a power struggle between gangsters and Batman/the police, the Joker offers to kill Batman in exchange for half the gangsters money. The end. That's it? that's the whole story? Yeah, OK we have the relationship angle with Rachel and Harvey and Bruce but seriously what a ridiculously dull storyline. The action is good without ever being exciting or involving, personally I didn't care how many anonymous henchmen Batman fought with or how many faceless extras were put in danger by the Joker. This film needed a major face off between the two and that just didn't happen. As for Heath Ledger's performance, the characters name is called the Joker, clue is in the title, he just wasn't funny. I can't remember a single wisecrack in the whole film. Joe Pesci in Goodfellas is the perfect template of how to play the Joker - likable, hilarious with a serious threat of explosive violence. Heath just wandered about looking like a mad goth grumbling in a Richard Nixon voice. As for Harvey two face what really was the point in introducing him right at the very end of the film? a total waste of a character. Overall I feel slightly cheated by this film. It's not the fantastic movie I was expecting, it's an above average sequel. Nor is it up there with THE great superhero films Superman - The Movie and Superman 2, Spiderman and Spiderman 2. These are great superhero films, these set the benchmark way above whatever this can reach. An enjoyable film but not worthy of it's overblown status."
7173,True,"Anyway, I finally got round to seeing The Dark Knight and, given the overwhelming and fanatical praise the movie has engendered, a rather negative critical evaluation which pours cold water on the mass hysteria seems a bit pointless. Because what do I know? But here goes anyway!So let's confine ourselves to a couple of observations that might give the adoring fans some food for thought.The plot, whilst completely linear, and in fact, rather banal, was confusingly laid out, and not because Nolan was trying for anything enigmatic or even thought provoking; simply it was a tale not very well told. Muddying up a plot, especially one so basic, is not the mark of a clever movie, simply a poor one.The fight scenes were likewise confused and consequently rather uninvolving. And somebody must have been on a bonus to see how many shots of the back end of the ""Batcycle"" could be included in the final cut.POSSIBLE SPOILER ELEMENTPOSSIBLE SPOILER ELEMENTBut the real surprise for me was the misuse - and I think it is misuse, however deliberately it was conceived - of the central character of Batman.Batman was essentially a bystander in his own movie. He didn't really seem to do anything, other than swan off to Hong Kong, a sub plot that seemed to be taken from a another movie altogether.Harvey Dent was the protagonist of this film and The Joker the antagonist.Batman was seemingly cast adrift, totally peripheral and rather ineffective. It seemed to me that everyone's destiny was settled without much help from Batman, and even the Joker achieved pretty much what he wanted to do.I'd almost go as far to say that if the movie had done away with Batman and had been rewritten as a straight crime procedural, it would have been a better movie. Now Nolan and his buddies obviously know what they wanted to achieve, which is fair enough. I am just surprised with the impression I was left with.Still as I said at the beginning, I am really the wrong person to critique this film. I was cajoled into going and I thought, well it will probably be OK. And, being kind, that is just about what it was."
7174,True,"OK, Batman TDK is a good thriller, worthing maybe a 7 out of 10: but is simply not conceivable that it is ranked more than masterpieces like The Godfather and other wonderful pieces of art. Batman TDK is NOT a piece of art: is just entertainment. Good entertainment, even if the movie is a bit long, the plot confused and sometimes non-sense (what about the logic of the ending? Mobile-phone image scanning?),etc. etc. as other reviewers already commented. The Batman character voice is also pathetic with the forced laryngitis-like tone: do you want Batman to talk like a 140 kg wrestling player? Nah... Those things may perhaps have impact on kids but look ridiculous to any other (more mature) audience. Heath Ledger's performance is good, in my opinion the best thing in this movie. I liked his performance when the Joker is coming out from the hospital before the explosion, when he walked in a very strange psychotic-way, dressed like a nurse. Ahaha, I liked his mimic! I put 1/10 on this movie knowing that it deserves probably a 7/10 to reduce this insane over-rating."
7175,True,"Okey I went to the cinema for this movie with the idea it was higher rated then the godfather and pulp fiction... Well i just registered to IMDb to say I was very disappointed about this movie. Just because the flaws in the movie some. Here are some really stupid things in the movie: 1. Batman can bend a gun barrel whit his bare hands. 2. Dogs can chew true batman Armour but bullets can't. 3. The Joker can do everything: 3.1 He drives a school-bus into a bank and drive away without being noticed by anyone. And the bus had no scratch on it. 3.2 He can get into everything even on a parade with 100 of cops and the cops just ignore him there not even thinking about where there college's are. (But cops don't think in this movie they just panic when 1 guy takes a shot at the mayor) 3.3 The hospital that is guarded by lot of cops, Joker just walked in, the explosives are just there and he just walked out and blows the whole place up. He gets on a school bus and vanished into fin air. 3.4 He has tons of explosives on ferries that are heavily overcrowded. 3.5 They lock him up with a personal guard but they also lock him up in a general jail. Did he wanted room-service on his jail or was the personal guard to prevent him from getting bored? (but again cops are stupid in this movie)I had a lot of moment in the movie with:'Just shoot the Joker!!!!!'. Gotham was not Gotham but some city in the USA. Batcave was some to big ugly place under the ground with to many lights. third degree burn wounds just put a blanked on it wait some days and its all good but ugly. And god he was in pain I really noticed that... Balistic testing with some big ass gun why do you need a machine gun to fire 1 shot at a time for testing. This movie is just bad.But there some good things one is the joker was good he missed some good Joker jokes but at least is was evil. And really that the best thing I have to say about the movie. I give it a 1 against all those who gave it a 10... normally I would give it a 6/10"
7176,True,"Yawn.A few years ago, despite repeated critical praise and entreaties from friends and colleagues, I gave up on ever wasting my precious time on earth watching another Steven Spielberg film. Time and again I was told, by others, 'No, this time I really mean it, it's a GREAT film,' and time and again I would leave the theater angry or nauseous. But, now I am at the point where I feel the same way about ALL Hollywood tripe. As with the Spielberg crapfests, I was told how wonderful excrement like Brokeback Mountain and Crash were. They weren't. Similarly, almost all the reviews of The Dark Knight were glowing; especially praising the performance of Heath Ledger (the cock-mumbling hero of Brokeback Mountain) as the Joker. And with his demise shortly before last year's premiere of the film, the inevitable chorus of Oscar buzz for his performance rose, with him, indeed, snagging a posthumous Best Supporting Actor nomination and win (ala James Dean). So, was this the greatest film of all time? Was Ledger's performance one for the ages?No.In fact, not even close. And, as badly hyped as the Spielberg stool has been, and as nauseating as the PC films named above were, The Dark Knight, and Ledger's performance, have to be the two most over the top unbelievably hyper-hyped things Hollywood has ever unfurled. Why? Simple. The picture barely rises above mediocre, and Ledger is nowhere near as good a Joker as Jack Nicholson was, twenty years ago, in Tim Burton's Batman.The Dark Knight simply goes on for far too long- 153 minutes- and gets worse with each passing minute. It goes from a possibly good film, in its first hour, to a barely passable one in the span of the last hour or so. A good 45 minutes could have been lopped off with no discernible detraction from the film. In ten years, few people will care about this film, and Ledger's Oscar win will go down as one of those great WTF? questions wiser generations will chuckle over. The Dark Knight is not good comic book stuff, it's not good sci fi, it's not a good action film. It's just hype.Yawn. (the sequel)"
7177,True,"Good cinematography and special effects makes a perfect movie??? Well, according to most people, I guess so. But for people like me (unfortunately there aren't too many of us individual-minded thinkers left), it takes a good STORY to lure us in. To me, this movie tried noticeably hard to pack everything together and failed... of course unless good cinematography and special effects gives you a hard on. A way-overdone story with an unrealistic genius villain loaded with shattering glass and more shattering glass is what I got out of it. One thing after another made me feel like I was watching ""Batman: The Law & Order Miniseries."" Oh yeah, for one of the best, if not the best movie of all time, this thing didn't leave me in awe for a second or raise the hair on my arm one bit like so many movies with a believable, likable story. Funny to think how well this film would have done if you could take away let's see... the cinematography and special effects."
7178,True,"When the Joker showed up at Wayne's fundraiser for Harvey Dent, my tentative rating was at an 8.5. I was thoroughly enjoying myself, and was having it go mano-a-mano with my all-time favorite superhero movie, Spider-Man 2. By the time Batman swerved around the Joker on his motorcycle, I was getting a little restless, a 7.5 maybe, and set the score around 7.5 or so; still liked the film, and was pleased that at least I was going to give it a positive grade, to spare myself the hassle. By the time Harvey Dent was chillin' in a warehouse with ol' Jim, I was rooting for Batman to die if only to end the film more quickly.There is a good film in here. Hell, there's a GREAT film in here, but my god, to humanize this film is to implore it to do a few crunches. The Dark Knight is hideously, mindbogglingly, monstrously overlong. Every source physical and electronic had informed me that the time FLEW by that it may have lasted two hours and thirty-two minutes, but it sure as hell didn't feel like it. Well, they're right. It DIDN'T feel like two hours and thirty-two minutes. It felt like three. By the time Dent got his faced burned, I was glad that it was finally wrapping up, because it had gone on a bit too long at that point. The HOUR that it spent unnecessarily wrapping up plot strands after that scene was what killed the film for me.There was definitely a lot to like here. In a superhero film, the constant is the hero, the variable, and thus, the definition of quality, is in the villain. The Joker is the best of the Batman villains because he's the most colorful, and yet the most terrifyingly plausible. He embodies things we fear on a fundamental level: People who hide their identity,in masks and grotesque makeup, who are unhinged, who can and will do anything on a whim. Where other villains include a poof who tells riddles and a man raised by penguins sewer (don't worry about correcting me if I got that wrong, I don't care), the Joker seems horrifyingly impervious to scrutiny.In the acting department, I had surprisingly little problem with Bale. He seemed less brooding and more personable, more lively than I had seen him. When he put on his scaaawy voice, my entire theater chuckled, but I understood what he was trying to do; it far more real and acceptable than before. As for the rest of the cast, Ledger did a good job, but by the halfway point, I grew tired of the film treating him as an go-to gag machine. The longer we sat with him, I saw him descend from Jerry Brudos into Jerry Lewis. People seem to overestimate the difficulty in playing a crazy person. Talk with a funny voice, affect a little walk, invent a couple of mannerisms, it's really all in the definition. The entire film, I was thinking: You know who could have been fabulous at this role? Andy Dick. Seriously, Ledger's put-on voice sounded almost exactly like Dick's normal voice, and there's a built-in hatred for the man anyway, what better way to immediately cultivate a visceral audience reaction? I think he could have done a fine job. Aaron Eckhart, on the other hand, was quite poor. He had the chiseled chin, and I know the man can act, but here he just seemed out of his element. Far too often, I saw Aaron Eckhart acting when I should have seen Harvey Dent speaking. As for positives, I thought Maggie Gyllenhall was a tremendous upgrade on Katie Holmes. She infused the character with dimensions and life, and she convinced me every second she was on screen. Michael Caine also did a fine job, and I want to give a mention to Eric Roberts, who I thought stained the screen with the sleaze emitting from his body in his meager calls to set. Most of the rest of the cast had little to do, although I was still lamenting that, as good as job as he did on the good side, possibly the great go-to villain actor of the last generation will never be given a chance to enliven a Batman villain.Batman Begins, which I gave a 6/10, ran 2:20. I don't remember feeling it was overlong, just sort of lame. While, The Dark Knight is as far from lame as you can get, but that other problem reared its ugly had and caused me far more pain that the immediate fizzle of its predecessor, because it had so much going for it, and it seemed to have squandered it with a wasted hour that did NOTHING NEW for the characters. Did anything that important happen in the final hour of the film that hadn't happened at least once beforehand? And every new thing they did introduced was so labored and obvious that it was just as much of a time waster as everything else.The word, more than any other, that I want to use for my opinion towards this film is ""lament"". I wanted to LOVE this film, to be greeted with open arms by my electronic peers into their cool, hip club that apparently numbers in the billions. And my initiation was all set. Bruce, Chris & I had passed several hurdles, several tests, on our way to being accepted together, hand-in-hand, brothers in arms. But like Harvey Dent's infamous coin, the game was rigged. They flipped it until we failed, and fall flat on our faces we did. Or at least, I did. We took part in a five-legged race, and they persevered while I got stuck with the shackles, and that's too bad. The finish line was in site, but they kept moving it back, and all I taste is dirt.{Grade: 6.25/10 (C+) / #16 (of 60) of 2008}"
7179,True,"I was could not wait to see this movie on the opening weekend. The critics and audiences everywhere were giving this movie such high praises. So I rushed to my local theater to catch what could be a known as the greatest superhero movie ever made in history. Two hours and something minutes later after the movie was done I realized the greatest thing ever made in history was the marketing package for The Dark Knight. Boy, did they over-hype this colossal nonsense of a movie.SPOILERS! 1) I don't understand why the martial arts style, Keysi, was used in the film. It just doesn't look cinematically pleasing in any sense. In the documentary for Batman Begins, the choreographers wanted Batman to look like an angry beast that would just run over people with his attacks. They didn't want to make the fighting look like a dance (like traditional Wushu). Great. So then what they decided to do was get a bunch of guys who look like they made a fighting style up. They look like monkeys hammer fisting each other! If you don't believe me check out the documentary: (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVWyqBdE5RI). As a result the fighting was clumsy, poorly staged, and filmed. Batman is supposed to be stealthy, nimble, yet powerful. But instead, he moves heavily and lethargically.2) Choppy plot development: Right after Batman dives off the building to save Rachel, what happens to the Joker? We're made to assume he left because Dent was not there. But was that it? Joker crashes a party, finds nothing, and just leaves? It's a movie about The Batman vs. The Joker!!! It's their first interaction with each other  isn't that suppose to be a grand event??!! Nope, instead Joker drops Rachel, Batman goes to save her, and Joker leaves the party. Its plot points like that that really weakens the movie. Another example is Batman's batpod chase throughout the city. At the very end of the sequence, Batman hurls himself at the Joker and falls off the bike. WTF???? No grand battle between good and evil? No epic moments of struggle between the two forces? Then James Gordon saves The Batman? Then why do we need Batman???? Which brings me to another point 3) WHY EXPLAIN SO MUCH? I DON'T CARE WHERE BATMAN GOT ALL OF HIS TOYS!!! It's like every scene had to explain why Batman could do what he does. Batman can bend guns cause his gauntlets have steel clamps built in them, Batman has white eyes because it's part of the sonar technology, Batman can now move his head around because the suit is now segmented instead of being once piece, Luscious Fox helps Batman utilized an escape method that was used in the 1960's by the military and so on and so on and so on and so on.If Batman is suppose to be this mythic creature, then why bother to demystify him at all? From the way they are explaining Batman, it just seems as if ANYBODY can be Batman. All you have to do is get martial arts training and a lot of money and that's it  NOW YOU ARE THE BATMAN. I can understand the explanations being used in Batman Begins, because it was an origins story, but in the Dark Knight, let's see why he's so good. Why only Bruce Wayne can be The Batman.4) And why all the philosophizing? I can understand the serious themes of the Batman mythos. In the books like ""Arkham Asylum: Serious House on Serious Earth"", """"The Long Halloween, Brian Azarello's ""Joker"" they take the time to explore the Dark Knight's world and the characters that inhabit them, but without trying to cram pompous banalities into your mind. In between the action scenes were benign philosophical interludes that were pretentious. And Batman talks way too much. Yes, Batman is more than just a muscle bound superhero, but couldn't we see that through his work as a Detective (which is what he is)? And the voice Christian Bale used was horrible to begin with so making him ramble on and on about right and wrong wasn't appealing at all.5) This movie was The Joker movie. It wasn't about the Batman. Nolan said he tried to make it more about the hero. He didn't want to make the ""mistake"" that Burton did with his Batman films where the hero was more of a minor character. Nolan repeated that mistake. Joker was once again the main focus of the movie.6) It was way too long. The movie should've ended after Batman defeated the Joker. Why bring Two Face into the picture at this point (where I was getting ready to leave the theater)? I really wished they saved Two Face for the third movie.So hopefully in the third movie they take a step back and really try to slow it down a bit. I know Nolan was ambitious in his creation of the sequel, but I felt like those ambitions blinded his ability to see the details. Too be honestI probably should have just rented this instead of paying $15 for the IMAX showing."
7180,True,"The main highlights of this dismal, dark isolated atmospheric superhero adventure movie is the Joker's (Heath Ledger) appearances the climactic special effects like the explosions and the believable dark clouds that surround this dreary, but riveting blockbuster. According to demographics, the majority of the audience who went to see ""The Dark Knight"" are 85% males between 18-35 who's minds are fixated on video games. And that is a non-surprising statistic.With the exception of Ledger's stunning performance, this movie fails to carry out its promise in gathering our interest in watching the good usurp the forces of evil, almost to the point where we take more sympathy for the evil Joker than the dark hero himself, Batman(Christian Bale).Bruce Wayne comes on to me as philandering playboy and his portrayal is thinner than a Ritz cracker. His envy and rage over the new female D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is more juvenile in personality without any sign of emotion at all. Even when they embrace in that fatal kiss, it's more manipulative than inspiring. Batman's robotic voice and stoic expressions convinces the audience into thinking, is that a man or a cyborg? This pedestrian performance may give the audience the impression that this movie was never meant for adults to watch. The anger and rage manifested in the Joker's soul has some spark of appeal and sorrow, but the schtick eventually become monotonous after a while that it becomes tiring after a while. The final scenes in the movie has very little excitement that afterwords people started to slowly trickle out of the cinema disappointed because of the set-up. It was just pure banal.Though it's not the worst movie in the world, it's still very over-rated in the end. The real standout was the Clown Prince of Evil himself the Joker. But even he couldn't save this movie himself. He wasn't getting any real help from his co-stars. But if you are those who just want to watch the movies just to see Heath Ledger one last time? Well the more power to you, but you really shouldn't do that on account of someone's unfortunate premature death."
7181,True,"Where did it all go wrong? Unfortunately all the hype turned out to be exactly that. Just hype. This is a mediocre and highly repetitive film, perhaps marginally better than average action movie. It certainly is a major improvement over the recent mess that was The Hulk, but that's not saying much. Then again, even The Hulk managed a little better in the character department for its first third, before devolving into mindless dross.They seem to have forgotten the things that made the first of the new Christian Bale Batman movies a success (In more than just box office). Dark Knight is a bloated misshapen mess of a film, with little coherent structure. From it's rather lacklustre opening to it's weak finale, we are just treated to a variety of scenes that just seem to have been lumped together. At 152 minutes, someone needed to seriously take the editing scissors to the negative. Then again, if the fat had been trimmed from this film, there wouldn't be much left. The first film worked, because we had different locations, an interesting back story, and some genuine character moments, that all came together to make the 'action' parts enjoyable. Because they had a reason for being, and we became invested in what happened to the characters.Dark Knight is simply a collection of action scenes, and 'Joker' scenes for the sake of it. Heath Ledger is serviceable as the Joker, but it's by no means an Oscar worthy performance. Jack Nicholson at least had a certain level of theatricality to make the character work, in Burton's Batman. Though in Heath Ledger's defence, he had very little to work with, character-wise. I think he did the best he could with it, despite lots of pointless 'Joker-giggling' and 'oh, look, I'm insane' expressions. There are virtually no meaningful character moments in the film, no real structure to the story, and so there is no emotional involvement in the action. The fight scenes seemed to lack any genuine sense of threat or risk, because it never felt like Batman was ever in danger. In the previous film, he was fighting people of equal training and skill, so you felt he was having to struggle to defeat his enemy. In Dark Knight, he's simply going through the motions. And any genuine threat in the violence is shied away from. Don't believe the other reviews. There's plenty of 'action' in this film, but not a lot of 'violence' as such. Which isn't always a good thing. It may keep it child-friendly (in a way) for the most part, but leaves us with no real sense of consequence or risk.In terms of setting, this time around they decided to film mostly on real city locations. The idea being, that this will make the atmosphere more realistic. Unfortunately this works against it. The ever so slight fantasy feel of Gotham in the first film, helps us as the viewer, to dwell in their reality and accept the fantastical parts. By bringing this new film more into the world of everyday reality, the more outlandish elements become less believable than they might have otherwise been, thereby resulting in a detachment from events, rather than drawing us in.Morgan Freeman is poorly used, with little to get his teeth into. While perhaps he did not have a large part in the previous film either, he was at least imbued with some sense of personality and a genuine feeling of necessity to the plot. Michael Caine fairs a little better, and is one of the few characters to maintain a reasonable level of personality and purpose, that is on a par with his character in Batman Begins.As for the Harvey Dent character, Aaron Eckhart is simply adequate, but apart from his general role as the District Attorney, his evolution into the 'Two Face' villain feels utterly superfluous and tacked-on for the sake of cramming in another temporary antagonist. Though admittedly, he has stunningly well executed CGI enhanced make-up. (unfortunately the un-shrivelled eye ruins the effect, since it simply would not have likely survived the wounds, and even if it had, would dry up and wither, without its surrounding tissue, eyelids and moisture.) He is supposed to be some sort of example about how evil can change and affect even the best of people, but it all feels clumsily executed and poorly resolved.So what's good? Maggie Gyllenhall as Rachel Dawes, brings her character some much needed depth. She's a more mature actress, both in style and looks, than Katie Holmes was (As the same character in the previous film). She also has a rather sad and tired appearance, which keeps her from looking like the typical overly-pretty female love-interest. She felt like a character that you could imagine he had grown up with and loved for herself, rather than simply an attractive face.To be honest, that's about the best that can be said, in comparison to the previous film. And in it's own right, it is a movie that can best be described as an enjoyable distraction, with virtually nothing to remember once you walk out. Sadly, this is very much another forgettable summer blockbuster. What makes it so disappointing is not that it is actually that bad, but simply that it should have been so much better, and certainly does not live up to the hype."
7182,True,"You have got to be kidding me! My husband and I decided to watch this piece of garbage on New Year's Eve instead of a marathon of The Office. Boy did we make the wrong choice. How do people like this ""film""? What has happened to artistic integrity and plain old good taste. The plot was disjointed, confusing, and ridiculous!! The direction was horrid. Even the actors who many I respect all looked like a bunch of sell outs who were in it for the paycheck. Gary Oldman are you joking? One of the greatest actors - what a horrible role. Could you not keep your English accent out of Gotham when you raised your voice? Don't you learn how to do that in acting 101? The highlight of the movie is when Rachel blows up. Sorry to be morbid but talk about a bore - that Maggie girl should take some lessons from her at least competent brother. Can anyone explain the plot in 1000 words or less? Unbelievably all over the place. Heath Ledger did a good job as the Joker, but please don't tell me this role drove him to emotional torment and insomnia. I have great respect for him as an actor and feel so sad for his death. I just don't understand what was so dark about the dark knight. Batman should definitely hang up his suit."
7183,True,"For a summer superhero movie, this is a great film to watch; however, in terms of greatest movies of all time, it is in no way number 3. It baffles me how some moviegoers could be so dumb. This is a good movie, but people grossly overrated it.The performances were great especially ledger who in my mind should get an Oscar nomination. - I enjoyed the movies darker grittier feel and I believe Nolan did a good job projecting that feel. - Etc...However, I believe there are no moments in the film that are really that revolutionary in terms of film making. The plot was not difficult to figure out: introduce the Joker, Batman fights the Joker, captures the Joker but OH NO!!! He tricked us, Batman fights the Joker against tremendous odds and of course wins. The basic plot was well presented though by Nolan who I believe has a very very bright future in Film making. This movie is very good but does not deserve the place it was awarded, although I think it can fit into a good spot on the top 250 list. But the lack of genre defining moments limit it to be merely a very good yet generic summer movie. Although I do believe that the Nolan era Batman movies take a giant dump on the previous Batman series which sucked."
7184,True,"Okay, so please don't immediately want to kill me for not liking this movie. And first, let me say that I thought that it was magnificently acted across the board, and that there were really excellent things about it. I understand why everyone likes it so much. But it just wasn't my cup of tea...as for why, I attempt to explain...and yes, THERE ARE SPOILERS HERE!!! While I may be alone in this, I wanted...how to put this...a more traditional superhero movie. I wanted the superhero to get the girl and defeat the villain. And honestly...in The Dark Knight, the girl died, and the villain won, basically. Which was kind of a downer, really.Also, I felt that it was a little jam-packed. With the whole fraudulent money thing, plus the two villains, plus all of the plot twists, it became one giant hell of a movie. There were so many random characters that were introduced that I found it difficult to keep track of all of them...for instance, the police detective Ramirez, and the man who replaced Falcone as the leader of the mob, (as well as less significant others) were difficult to keep track of. As a result, I did spend the first half hour being confused as to exactly what was going on. Also, in the same vein, I didn't see the point of having Cillian Murphy (Scarecrow) in the movie. His cameo was brief, placed in the middle of other action, didn't really add anything, and was too much, on top of everything that was already going on.Going off of that, a little, TDK had very little connection to the first movie. Obviously, as a sequel, it has license, but also as a sequel, I felt that it should have had a little more in common with the first movie. In Batman Begins, there was so much more Bruce Wayne -- It was mostly a Bruce Wayne movie as opposed to mostly a Batman movie. So much of the plot was devoted to Bruce's parents, and his training, and Rachel, and all the backstory, and that was partially why I really liked it so much. By contrast, there was NONE of that in TDK, and you kind of forget the bigger picture of why Bruce doing all of this (i.e his parents' legacy, Rachel...) This was totally a Batman movie, as opposed to a Bruce Wayne movie. Some people will undoubtedly like that better, and I imagine that Nolan did it intentionally, but I didn't like it as much.Although this is somewhat nit picky and couldn't be helped, I really didn't like that they switched from Katie Holmes to Maggie Gyllenaal. In my opinion, Gyllenhaal is a much better actress. However, the Batman Begins!Rachel and the Dark Knight!Rachel seemed to have nothing in common except that they shared the same name. I didn't think that they had any of the same personality traits, few of the same characteristics, and TDK!Rachel didn't seem to have a lasting, intense attachment to Bruce like that which was seen in the first movie.Lastly...and this is something that many will disagree with me about, but (although it was necessary to facilitate Dent's transformation) I really didn't like that Rachel died. I felt like she gave Bruce a higher purpose, where there was something that was more important to him than being Batman, and there was something waiting for him at the end of it all that made it all worthwhile. Now, though, there is no higher purpose. Now, he's just fighting and fighting until the criminals are vanquished, or he dies. There's no bigger picture, and it's very bleak. While that was probably intentional as well, it simply didn't suit me.That said, this movie was wonderfully acted, and Heath was absolutely incredible. Some things about it are brilliant, particularly the black humor. So, while it was not for me, it is still a great piece of cinema complete with phenomenal performances."
7185,True,"This comment is labelled as containing spoilers. In fact, it describes no actual events from the film, but it does talk about underlying themes, and it refers to 3 lines of dialogue. Read on if you wish.Batman has a new enemy - the Joker - and a new potential ally, Harvey Dent, the new up-and-coming District Attorney. The film quickly develops into a study of good versus evil.We discover the Joker's motivation for the evil that he does ... he has no apparent ultimate aim, he simply enjoys being evil. The sheer senselessness of his acts makes him unpredictable. As the film unfolds, the forces of good appear powerless; whatever they do, there is a greater evil, a more twisted motivation that they are unintentionally feeding. The film's title is, in fact, a triple pun ... it is metaphorically a ""dark night"" for the city, and much of the significant action takes place in a single night. By the end, we are asked to consider whether good or evil are simply a matter of luck, and whether truth as well as law are an inconvenience to doing good.The film is therefore thoroughly postmodern. It could be described as doing for justice what ""Titanic"" did for love ... showing it to be worthy and desirable, but ultimately unsustainable in the face of evil, corruption, and random blows dealt by Fate. There are some events in which good is seen to triumph, but in hindsight these are plot contrivances ... to do evil would have been so much easier.The film itself is also senseless in some ways. The factors that made the Joker what he is are never laid out. Nor are the (sometimes incredible) feats of anticipation and cooperation, which allow the Joker often to have an extra card up his sleeve, ever explained.There are two subtexts beneath the central theme of overwhelming evil: one is intentional, the other (I think) not. The first one is Batman's credo: ""sometimes, to do good, you have to act outside the law"". The second is based on a line spoken by the Joker: where good and evil clash on equal terms, evil is more powerful, because the good have to follow rules, whereas the evil have no rules.The film is well made: the special effects are very impressive, the acting is generally good, and it's technically very well made. But I found it disturbing and (literally) hopeless."
7186,True,"I finally watched it this evening and i have to say i was thoroughly entertained. no question about it. However, The Dark Knight falls short of greatness for several reasons. But if anything about the movie is great, then it has to be Heath Ledger's performance as the joker. I think he is the reason why some people are (wrongly) jumping on the bandwagon to label TDK as the greatest movie of all time. At best it might be the greatest superhero movie ever made but i wont pass any judgment on that particular point.I give this movie a 7 and that is mostly because of the entertainment it provided and ledger's joker. I can't possibly give it more than a 7 after seeing how unconvincing the Harvey Dent/Two-face character became towards the end. His transformation is hardly given enough time and as a result is totally unconvincing. As far as i can remember, it was not foreshadowed either, nor did his actions later on make any sense (e.g. why would he let Joker go free but decide to kill Maroni (the mob leader)? because according to Two-face, ""the Joker is just a mad dog. I want whoever let him off the leash."" lmao! give me a break!) Okay next up is the ferry subplot or whatever you might wanna call it. I've seen some people branding it as ""useless"". I beg to differ. I think the subplot/scene had great potential, only if the director/scriptwriter chose NOT to resort to the typical ""good overcomes evil"" thing which is prevalent in Hollywood and i guess in Disney and superhero movies in particular.First of all, although none of the ferries blew each other up, the point that the Joker was trying to prove was well-proved (at least to the audience). Because, think about it. The ferry voted and as much 400 people were FOR blowing the other ferry up while ONLY 150 people were against it. however, when it came to actually press the button of the detonator, nobody had the guts to do it. Fair enough, but how in the world does that prove the Joker wrong? If anything, it proves that not only ""deep down, everyone is as ugly as him"", but they are cowards also! Therefore, to pass it off as some kind of a ""good vs evil"" thing where good wins the day is a futile attempt. And last but not least, the idea of all of Gotham's notorious thugs and criminals suddenly becoming moral beings with no intention of survival was laughable.You see, this is where the Joker should have had his ""moral"" victory over Batman. The people in the ferries should have killed each other. And in that way, some kind of a balance would have been established and The Dark Knight would have truly become a ""dark"" film, because as we know, in the end Batman does not let the Joker win by taking all the blame on himself. And that brings me to the next point.The ending was forced and didn't make much sense. So the highly principled DA of Gotham goes nuts after his fiancé's death and after losing half his face and then, ACTUALLY KILLED a mob leader and corrupt cops? And Batman takes the blame for this? lol WHY ON EARTH would people hate Batman for killing a mob leader and corrupt cops? Again, makes no sense.So these are the few things that bugs me most and I'm not even gonna start with the pretty poor script with its flaws and stretches (which are quite a lot even for a superhero movie). As for the entertainment value, yes i was entertained as I've said before but i have to say that i found the action sequences to be very ordinary. I think at the end of the day, it is Heath Ledger who makes it a (slightly) better movie than Batman Begins. I can't say Christian Bale gave a good performance because frankly, he didn't have much to do! But it's a shame that we won't be seeing Heath Ledger in a Joker makeup again. It breaks my heart. If I give this movie a 7 out of 10, I would have to give Ledger a solid 10. I hope he at least gets an Oscar nomination."
7187,True,"This has to be one of the most overrated films I have seen. It isn't a bad film at all, it isn't overly dark like some of the Tim Burton Batman's, which was a nice surprise. But this film shouldn't have 8.9 out of 10. It's more a 6 or 7. To think that Dent could just all of a sudden turn from the cities Saviour, to being some psycho loony, for no other reason than his girlfriend being killed, is ridiculous! He stood up against everyone, and then one person he loves dies, and he loses it?? The acting in this film is good, although Christian Bale is not that good at all. Can you really tell him apart in this, as apposed to American Psycho, or even Shaft? I agree that Heath Ledger is great as the joker, but I have to think, if he hadn't died, would everyone still think he was so amazing. I really thought that the Batman Begins was a better film, and it was interesting to see how he became batman. It does seem amazing, how things become so fashionable, and people all rave about something when everyone else seems to be. This films plot is weak, and at points, like with Dent, it is just plain stupid. To be honest, this is the problem with films nowadays, all people seem to want, is great special effects, and lots of action. But what about the plot?? For me, the best decades for music were the 60's and 70's, and for films, without doubt the 80's. Sure, some films are bit dated now, but they are classics. The goonies for example, is for me, the greatest kids adventure film ever made, and one of the best adult adventure films ever made too. It had action, but it also had great acting, and a great storyline. I know the goonies has nothing to do with Batman, but it seems people are satisfied with mediocrity nowadays, with music and with films. Bands where the musicians sound like they just started playing the guitar a month ago, and films with lots of action, but no substance. And the worst part, no one seems to care? Shouldn't we being asking for more for our money?"
7188,True,"I am sincerely confused by all the hype around this movie. It just didn't seem that great to me. No characters had any personality or motivation whatsoever, except the Joker. There was no plot structure at all... the entire thing was just the Joker threatening to kill people and everybody freaking out, then repeat, then repeat again. No break in the action, no climax. And all this for at least two hours. By the end I was TRYING to fall asleep.Not to mention the really, really stupid plot devices. (If you don't care to hear my rant/list of these, which may include SPOILERS, skip to the next paragraph!) Being able to remotely transform all cellphones into high-resolution sonar devices? This idea is just stupid. Wayne chooses ""taking a boat ride with the entire Russian ballet"" as an alibi? Because somehow he trusts all these near-strangers enough not to blow his cover? That entire plot device was clearly an excuse to fit in at least one scene with scantily-clad women. And the Joker escapes from jail because they didn't bother to put his handcuffs back on after Batman took them off. How lame is that? As soon as he got into jail it was obvious he'd escape, because that's how these stereotypical plots always go, but I at least hoped it would be because of Joker's cleverness rather than because of a completely unrealistic and inexplicable lack of security. He was an infamously dangerous criminal, obviously an entire police station wouldn't be so lax around him. And when he holds his knife to an officer's neck to make demands, another officer about ten feet away is pointing a gun and has a clear shot at his head, and a reason to shoot, but he doesn't. Why not? This movie follows SO many other predictable plot stereotypes. Like the fact that as SOON as Harvey is disfigured, it's completely obvious that he is going to become a villain. Because you can't be disfigured without being evil... Only the handsomest of men are heroes. The most annoying thing is how they didn't even feel the need to explain his lighting-quick transition to being a supervillain with no convincing motivation except for showing his burns, because as soon as you saw that his face was burned you just knew he was evil, end of story. It's just like the way that as soon as you see a child in this movie, you KNOW that group of people won't die, because children never die, of course. The audience might be offended. Also, both protagonists are totally infatuated with some boring girl for no apparent reason, which is a pretty good sign that a movie isn't very thoughtful.Some of the ridiculousness and predictability of the movie's plot could have been forgiven if it wasn't so very tedious. Two hours of the exact same continuous action sequence with no breaks to allow for deeper plot or character development is just too much. Unless you like watching violence for its own sake regardless of plot, and have a really, really long attention span, I can't understand why you like this movie (and you probably do, everyone does, apparently). Not to mention that this long tedious action sequence mostly consists of the exact plot of the first half being reused as the second half (Joker's setup on the boat and the hospital were the same story, it's as if they couldn't decide which one to use and then thought ""hey, let's make this movie REALLY long and just use both of them, one right after the other..."").It did have some redeeming qualities. The joker WAS great, the nihilistic spin on his character was well-done. The beginning was relatively interesting, before they got into the repetitive action sequences. And toward the end they killed someone who I really didn't predict would die. But, I would never, EVER sit through this again."
7189,True,"Those looking for some fun, a bit of entertainment, will be disappointed by The Dark Knight. It's almost as if the director is trying not to make a superhero film at all, its desperate attempts to make everything plausible and gritty ignoring the fact that the two protagonists are actually a mad clown and a man who dresses as a bat...Fair enough if you don't want to make a superhero film, but if you don't want to make said film please don't pick one of the most famous superheroes of all time to drag down into an overlong grim-fest with far too much standing around and discussion of the film's plot.As with the (superior) Batman of Tim Burton, once again the Joker dominates the film. The problem is that Ledger's Joker does not really play any jokes, have any gadgets, or try to make anyone laugh. The Joker should be scary AND funny, and Ledger fails in this regard. Bale's Batman is also portrayed as a thug, beating up an imprisoned Joker and dropping a villain out of a building. Isn't Batman supposed to be the 'World's Greatest Detective'? Isn't he supposed to use his brains and intelligence to outwit the villains, rather than just pounding them to a pulp? Perhaps this is a reflection of tactics deemed acceptable by the War on Terror but it isn't the Batman I admire.Dark Knight's claim to realism is also blown out of the water by the Joker's merry band of mental hospital patients (!) managing to install huge amounts of explosives in hospitals, ferries, offices etc without anyone noticing till the conveniently dramatic crucial moment. Finally, the Batman rescues the Joker from falling to his death, because, after all, Bats is a hero. Sadly this contradicts his actions in Batman Begins where he refuses to save Ducard from certain death on the stricken Gotham monorail.Overall, the film leaves a nasty taste in the mouth. For some viewers, the darker the better, and as a teenager I'm sure I would have loved this film. But if you want dark, watch a horror or a thriller, and leave superheroes alone to be larger than life. I'm not advocating a return to the days of the Joel Schumacher neon-nightmares, but this film should have allowed Batman to have a bit of fun, and be less of a thug."
7190,True,"Ledger is irresistibly interesting in his portrayal of the Joker despite the somewhat hackneyed plot, and his performance saves the film from disaster. Without his performance I would have walked out as the rest of the film was trite, melodramatic, garbage.Christian Bale gives wood a bad name as he soullessly meanders through the role. The guttural growling he performs as Batman may make sense to the plot but its almost unbearable to listen to .The previous film with Bale a beaten down outcast and a man struggling for an identity was infinitely more interesting from an acting perspective than this film. Bale feels trapped in the role in this film going through the motions and he seems bored and unchallenged almost not knowing what to do with it. The plot also doesn't have the structure of the previous film. There was a appreciable beginning, middle, and end of the previous film that let things percolate, the action build, the plot be exposed.This film is too evenly paced and like an unstructured watercolor the plot runs together and gets lost somewhere along the line.(or maybe I just lost interest) I remember seeing a scene with the Joker in a nurses costume, and while the character was interesting not knowing or caring at that point why the Joker was blowing the place up. The Two-Face character was fairly weak, the emotions in the wronged Harvey Dent seemed forced and the plot explanation of his 'do-gooder' gone wrong personality seemed ham-fisted. Maggie Gyllenhaal was not a particularly interesting character and there were no fireworks between her and either Bale or Eckhart. Michael Caine almost seemed to be biting his lips to spit out the lines in the film. He seems to be almost embarrassed to be in the film. Acting wise the highlights are Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and of course Heath Ledger who you never doubt 100% inhabit their parts and actually add something positive to the film.Unfortunately they are fighting an uneven script, a hackneyed story, and bad acting from Bale and others the whole way.The result is an uneven, and eventually uninteresting film that relies on constant action and superficial delights to offset the uneven acting and flat out bad plot. Certainly inferior to its predecessor and without Ledger would have been an outright disaster. I feel a bit alone on this analysis and I am surprised as anyone about this as I was expecting greatness when I went into the theater. But thats the way the cookie crumbles."
7191,True,"My expectation for Batman: The Dark Knight, the 2nd of the newer, sleeker installments was probably a little high mostly due to the word of mouth of co-workers/friends calling it better than/ as good as Batman Begins. Unfortunately I didn't think so. There is an awful lot of jockeying and expository dialog - too much - testing my patience. The media reported ""Oscar-Worthy"" performance by Ledger, while good, is not fantastic. He is only sporadically on the screen. It follows, the movie I think suffers from the film-makers trying to develop several story lines at once. The Joker should've been focused on more - (spoiler) instead we have the Joker, love triangle weirdness, and Harvey Dent villain development. Also, what is with Christian Bale's raspy (I'm masking my voice) line delivery when in the suit - detracting and awful. A fan of the original 89 movie, I'd also like to add both of the lead females in these newer Batman movies really don't bring the class and presence of Basinger from the original - they are the girl next door - Gyllanthal is a good actress but is not a fit in this movie imo (maybe even less so than Holmes in Batman Begins),... anyway.....,Interlaced were a great locale skyline/scene in Hong Kong, and about 2/3 of the way through a superior chase scene delivering (spoiler!) the most exhilarating moment technically in the movie - the tank transformation. There was some great final dialog by the Joker delivered to Batman too - For me these were badly needed elements, but few between. Also we have a less interesting/less imaginative crises - (spoiler) bomb hostages vs. weird kooky interesting hallucinogen idea in Begins. I was hoping for more ""wow"" moments, but instead got more hand-to-hand combat and rapid-fire expository dialog - ho-hum - Some editing and recasting could've done this movie some good. Mixed review, with several entertaining scenes trying to break out of the mold...."
7192,True,"The Dark Knight in my opinion was a little disappointing. This was not caused by so much of the quality of the movie but by all the hype that critics and other viewers created. It is obvious Heath Ledger is the star of the movie whether he is considered the lead or supporting actor, but he does play an outstanding role. The only problem with Ledger and the movie is that it is over shadowed by Ledger's death. Only since Ledger's death did this movie become so anticipated and it is the only reason why it is getting so much credibility. Many viewers also have over looked Christian Bale who also played a well role as Batman/Bruce Wayne.The movie also has many flaws, Aaron Eckhart's little flip of the coin to decide someone's fate is taken from No Country For Old Men. Then, some how, the Joker can find 1,000 tanks of oil and put it under a hospital or two boats without anybody noticing it even though the police were searching the entire city for traps and explosives. The excuse most people would use is that its comic book movie, but the rest of the movie wasn't. So your telling me the director can make two scenes of the movie a comic book movie so that it can unrealistic.Also, what happens to the Joker? Sure you can say he was arrested, but then you have to think he was already arrested once in this movie and escaped so how do you know that he can't do it again. Then in my mind the worst part was the length of the film. The film did not have to be longer then 2 hours, and if you were to add extra scenes it shouldn't be action scenes, it should be about the Joker's past because in Batman Begins the movie touches on Bruce Wayne's past in such detail that it creates a story which this movie should have done with the Joker.Overall this movie was good and Ledger can be considered for an Oscar Nomination, but i hope the next installment to the series will not be so hyped up so that viewers will not be disappointed."
7193,True,"First of all, this movie has a pretty good cast. It's a shame that Freeman and Oldman have such small roles because Christian Bale as Batman would be as forgettable as the usher if his voice wasn't so stupid. The joker was indeed played excellently by Ledger which saves this film from absolute mediocrity, but I can't understand why the performance could deserve an Oscar. He just plays a crazy guy well. His character lacks any other emotions or motivations. The effects and gadgets are very impressive, if not a bit ridiculous at times, but it's a comic book movie and I wasn't hoping for realism. The plot is a bit messy and dragged out but overall quite good. I felt like two face was created rather inexplicably and was killed off too soon. Ranked the best movie EVER at present?! Not by a long shot. I didn't leave the cinema feeling moved, thoughtful or blown away. It was just a decent action film."
7194,True,"I loved Batman Begins. It advanced from Burton's shallow fun and brought him reality. Naturally I expected yet more from Goyer and Nolan. Boy was I wrong. This ""movie"" is a nerdy fanboy jerk fest. The hype it has received is so unjustifiable that it can only be the product of Warner marketing and fanboy Internet manipulation; no film can go to #1 on IMDb in 48 HOURS without prior orchestration.While a final reckoning between Batman and Gotham's lowest is inspired the story becomes a mess of plot lunacy. The Joker's great but I was dumbstruck to watch the camera suck off Ledger's performance to wallpaper over plot chasms, generally shallow characters and a complete lack of the Dark Knight himself. Where is Batman in this movie!? He is nothing, a playboy billionaire on a yacht who wrecks Lamborghini's in a vain attempt to prove he's a hero. He didn't prove it to me one shred. Batman Begins reveals Wayne as a tortured soul making the world a better place for the memory of his mother and father. His moral code here was impossible to track. He mocks other vigilantes with high school quips about hockey while they get murdered (along with many) for what they believe. Isn't what they believe what he believes? Claims he mustn't kill (comic lore) as its immoral but happily jams shut a police interrogation door so he can beat six bells out of the Joker. It seemed to me that Gordon and Dent with the placid Ms. Dawes were in the moral front line while Batman lurks in shadows. All Mr. Wayne contributes are ridiculous gizmo's for epileptic action scenes. Batbike's tripping trucks like Skywalker tripping an ATAT, cell phones become security cameras, Gatling guns that rebuild bullets so we can scrutinise fingerprints for no good reason, another bat-suit, Lamborghini's & yacht lounging, need I go on?The worse effect of this is do you even need Batman? Consider a film with Gordon and Dent fighting alone against the Joker's criminal nihilism. They battle and win only for Dent to be consumed by his war against evil. Sounds good? I was watching that fine movie until they wrote Batman into it! And when the Batman spoke at all it was digitised alligator gruff tone that made me laugh. The story ricochets everywhere. Hong Kong, a Gotham come Miami and through multiple plots until you're just enjoying the cinematography during another action yawn. After two hours I could not care who did what or why, least of all Batman. This film resembled an over hyped episode of ""24"", complete with real-time ""waronterror"" inspirations, to such a degree I wondered if Jack Bauer would make a better Batman. At least he would have been at the forefront of events a little more. For a superhero the Dark Knight was an amoral superflop. The culmination of this movie's propensity for absurdity it the arrival of Two Face. His injury from some of the Joker's mountain of bombs is ridiculous. No human being could come close to surviving this let alone check out of a hospital to roam the streets for revenge. But it was done for the comic owner's need to make the silly real for fans and ultimately that's what this film is about.Dark Knight's biggest error is its script editing. It seems most of the writing is done by the Nolan brothers with just minor input from Goyer. Has the studio let the Nolan boys run amuck? Every idea they have come up with (or stole from ""24"") is crammed into this film until it explodes. Some don't rate Goyer but he has more experience writing and may have controlled (a few must be his) the absurd elements and kept pacing sensible. This film is also far detached from Nolan's previous work (Prestige, Momento) and is either a poorly conceived sortie into action adventure on his part or the studio's yanked the rug from under him. It does appear Warner's sponging off Ledger's unfortunate demise with him receiving TRIPLE screen time from Batman. Bale also seems bored when he performs. He has always liked deep complex characters to play so I suspect he was also unimpressed with the script.Batman Begins was outstanding but IMHO The Dark Knight lets its predecessor down in spectacular fashion. I won't say don't see it. Do and make up your own mind. If you are one of the happy, brain washed masses that love The Dark Knight because Warner/DC says you should then enjoy. However, I am not one of them. Sorry Bat fans."
7195,True,"The only 2 reasons I give this film a 7 is: 1) Heath Ledger's fantastic performance, truly deserving all the Oscar buzz he's getting. And 2) Aaron Echhart as Harvey Dent/Two-Face. Despite those two excellent performances the movie is surprisingly... average.Now how can I say that after it's become the number 2 movie of all time and is one of the highest rated movies on IMDb??? Easily. It was too long and convoluted (and boring). Every time Heath Ledger was off screen I found myself eyeballin' my watch... something I didn't do with Batman Begins (a better film), until - to my surprise - Harvey Dent became Two-Face (I thought they were gonna save him as villain for the next film). When I first saw the trailer to this film I thought two things: Heath Ledger looks cool and the action scenes look dull (Which is why I waited so long to see it in theaters). Now, maybe I'm wrong, but for me, what is essentially an action movie should have exciting action sequences. I couldn't count one. I didn't come to see a Batman movie for a moody drama with a couple of good villain performances... I came for an exciting film. This was not an exciting film.... In Batman Begins Christian Bale gave us the most interesting Bruce Wayne/Batman ever... in this he registers zero.... I could go on forever but this movie is so AVERAGE that it's not worth the time (I'll save longer reviews for truly great films or truly awful films)."
7196,True,"Well, it's been a few years, but I might as well warn future moviegoers.This is the movie which so many critics and viewers raved about, yet I couldn't see what for. Let me explain:I'll be brief because I don't want to reveal too much of the plot. The film is basically where the Joker sets out to corrupt the Batman and to prove that 'chaos is order' through death and destruction, and Batman goes to his limits to defeat him. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne goes through an emotional crisis as Rachel Dawes is now dating Harvey Dent, who later is scarred and becomes Two-Face. It sounds good like this, but it's not.The two main leads are terribly irritating and not at all like the comic book and cartoon versions. Instead of a deformed, conniving, sinister clown, the Joker is a painted emo who preaches about chaos while he senselessly murders people to no apparent aim except to cause that Batman turn to the dark side. I'm not sure if his plan was to pretend to be crazy so that he could conquer the crime syndicate, because it never clearly states any actual goal of his. He acted like some generic psycho, not the real Joker, and I could get ten times better on Criminal Minds.Meanwhile, the Batman is constantly whining about how terrible his life is, and pining after Rachel, and several rushed scenes leave it ambiguous as to whether he wants to be Batman or not. It seems to be a poor rehash of Spider-Man 2, which did this story-line much better. The Batman is the one character in the superhero universe who sacrifices personal relationships for justice more than any, so this is an inherent contradiction of his character. The worst part of all this, though, is that he actually believes some of the Joker's moronic pseudo-philosophy, and acts as if he will somehow be exactly like the Joker and go around murdering people needlessly if he kills him. Really, though, Gotham would be better off if the Joker died, yet the Batman saves him even though, in the final fight, killing him is in self-defense. I didn't get any sense of the bitter rivalry between the two.The rest of the movie doesn't fare well, either. Harvey only becomes Two-Face later on in the second half, after the mob deforms him and kills Rachel. The Joker is responsible, of course, yet, he goes after a few corrupt cops and then Gordon's family. They give no back story to him or reason for his actions, and he is killed off accidentally by Batman. Plus, the love triangle angle is never fully developed anyway (although, because I never really liked her, I wasn't sad when Rachel died). Sal Maroni is a minor secondary villain, but gets more involvement than Alfred or Lucius (they're just minor roles here). Gordon is the only consistent and interesting character in the whole movie.The film is too dark (literally, because everything's in shadows), and the actions scenes, while sometimes good, are hard to see, and seems misplaced anyway. He travels to China to capture a mobster who's not really important, and destroys half of Gotham in a pointless chase scene. The Joker magically seems to be able to blow up bridges, a hospital and ferries, and hack into television broadcasting, without notice and with unlimited resources, but his acting makes this all too unbelievable. His idiotic master plan is to rig two ferries with explosives and see who blows who up first, and the Batman defeats him by magnetizing the city's cellphones to track him. And, in the end, the Batman pretends to be responsible for Harvey's crimes after the latter's death so that the Joker's doesn't win the battle for Gotham's soul (although he and Gordon commit corruption, so the Joker does win, anyway). The musical score is fine, but it's the same one from the last film.All in all, it's just boring and dull. All the philosophy was nonsense, and felt forced. They just used the Batman franchise to sell a film which would otherwise be panned by critics (so why it wasn't, I don't know). I don't recommend that you don't watch, but don't be sucked in by all the hype."
7197,True,"Well I had anticipated that it would be something like this, with all the hype about this movie. I gotta give one thing to them though, it was well commercialized, which is probably one of the causes for it's super god status.Now going into the movie, the first flaw that caught my eye, the most, was during the first 10 min of the movie when Batman takes a hard bang on a concrete wall trying to climb a van and then the dog bites he gets. Both of which were shown later in a scene where Bruce is stitching and mending his wounds. Now fast forward to the part where the Joker drops Rachel from a skyscraper and Batman plunges like he was Superman, both take a fall on a car and both are absolutely fine?! Come ON ! at least put some rope action or something, also why doesn't Batman go back to the top floor where all the guests are left with the ""deranged"" Joker? Or is it that Joker just said ""oh Batman is gone the scene is over I should leave too?"" ridiculous!So i relentlessly made myself forget all that , but then i realized that Nolan and Ledger were both too busy trying to darken the joker character to a point where they forgot that the movie is a batman movie and Alfred is a lot more important in his life than a butler. and that because it is a batman movie there should have been glimpses of Batman's dead parents, well at least once cause that is the reason he is Batman/ the dark knight. Adding more fuel to fire where was his bat-craft ? when he went to Hong Kong to kidnap the mob boss , why would he spend billions on a cargo plane and not on his own bat-craft, I failed to see the logic - cargo planes are slower and easily traceable where as the bat-craft is fast and can beat radars. I would call this missed opportunity for the movie. And then came the sonar phone thing now Batman said that the technology allowed them to monitor 2 or 3 million phones, does Nolan know how big a server you would require to do that? Given that you had access to all security protocols from alien ware. Instead they stuck in about 600 little LCD screens and 4 or 5 servers. in my opinion lame. Now comes the joker character : 1. he should have laughed hysterically all the time, if ledger had managed to do that, then it would have been perfect. he basically missed the craziness of the real joker. 2. Joker does not go around telling people how he got the scar . but it is true that he makes up a different story each time he says it, but this is when he is asked about it, he doesn't advertise it! even if i take it for what they did in the movie i think it was way overdone, joker seemed like a Joker merchandise salesman to attract kids buying the new joker t-shirts ""Why so Serious?"" and crap and by God it has worked, but that is not what makes great movies. Now few things they did get right : joker and batman confrontation at the precinct that was the best scene of the whole movie, joker's dialogue was straight from the comic books, but again minus the laughter. Gordon's character, as in his importance in Gotham was well portrayed although, it was very rushed. - forgivable.. Harvey Dent was good but two face lacked the intensity. over all i would say the movie wasn't made for the Batman comic fans but more for the people who like blockbusters. You should watch it cause its fun to watch and you will realize all the opportunities it had to make it an actual masterpiece in the comic book movie adaptation genre. Now looking forward to watchmen, superman: man of steel and the next Batman which could be Arkham Asylum !"
7198,True,"How could the critics and the public be so WRONG about a movie? Well, the public is easily influenced, especially if they are teenagers with no broad movie-going experience to allow them to contrast this with other films. But the critics? More and more I get the feeling that the reviews we see are no longer about quality but only about sales. In this world of ""reality"" shows that are anything but - and MTV music videos that are to what film-making is that McDonald's is to cuisine - well, who can blame them if they no longer have any reliable criteria?What is WRONG with this movie? Just about everything... First and foremost, we don't CARE about anyone. Whether they live or die doesn't seem to really matter at all. Did ANYONE get teary-eyed over Maggy Gyllenhaal's death? I certainly didn't. We are not really given any time to FEEL anything. Second: no real suspense about anything. We're not given enough information, there is almost no attempt to build suspense... we just sit there passively watching as events keep happening all around us with NO attention to logic. Just one example: the Riddler is left in a locked room with a policeman. He has bizarrely been left without his handcuffs on... and all of a sudden the two of tehm are outside the jail-cell, and the Riddler has a knife at the man's throat. We don't know where the knife came from, we didn't see him overpower the guard, we don't know how they got out of a locked room. This is LAZY film-making... and it happens over and over again throughout this film. Events happen but there is no logical progression. The action scenes. Terrible. Everything is shot like an MTV video. Close-ups of the action that leave us with very little idea of what is really happening. The car-chase sequences were boring, because we had no real idea of who was where. It was all just a lot of close-up chopped editing. If this is supposed to be thrilling, then I suggest everyone go back and watch the chariot race from Ben Hur. No special effects, no insane wild editing in close-ups that don't allow us to really see what is happening... and yet it is three (four, five?) times more exciting than anything in this film. Bruce Wayne/Batman: stupid voice for batman, is he trying to channel Darth Vador? Wooden acting ... no sense of humour. A bore. The Riddler: better than I expected, but not as brilliant as everyone says. OF COURSE he'll get the Oscar, but mainly because he should have gotten it for Brokeback Mountain, and because he died. Everyone else? Just wasted talent... Such a disappointment, after Batman Begins..."
7199,True,"For me, 'Batman Begins' is the ultimate Batman movie and I was very much looking forward to The Dark Knight. I had some reservations about Heath Ledger and thought that the hype about his playing is created only because of his untimely death earlier this year. But I was wrong as he was excellent as the Joker. As a matter of fact, he was so much better than anyone else in this movie that he sort of played the others 'off' the screen. The acting the other big names did in this movie seems very weak if I compare it to Ledger's outstanding work. This is his movie,no doubt about that. My real problem with this movie was that the plot is weak and a lot of things are predictable. While '..Begins' builds up the world of Batman and explains his motivations, clearly shows the links and connections and does all this in a stunningly dark & sinister atmosphere, The Dark Night fails to build on the heritage of Nolan's first Batman movie. Techincally this movie is 10/10 but as long as the story, characters and playing are concerned, it is just lame at several points. Bale's 'Batman voice' is just terrible and ridiculous at the same time. Instead of adding to the 'batmanism' of Bruce Wayne this voice-thing makes him funny, in a very lame way. I was more than annoyed by this while watching the movie. All in all, I so much wanted to love this movie but looks like this won't happen. My mark is 5/10."
7200,True,If I'd been sitting at the end of a row in the cinema I would have left after 30 minutes. I've sat through enough hard hitting films to know the difference between meaningful grit and wanton hatefulness. The production values in this film are so high that the 'terror' that is deliberately laid down seems genuinely possible in its evilness. The killings and explosions however do not support the supposedly 'psychological' subtext. Two men sitting either side of the same coin...or as Gotham DA's coin shows....both the same side... is not adequately developed. The story's many conflagrations and large set piece explosions cannot possibly have been set up by one man (The Joker) in any reasonable timescale - and certainly not in the one suggested in the film. The whole thing is just preposterous - it is just an exercise in slash and burn without relief. I had one hell of a headache after seeing this film - I can't have been the only one. One other patron I heard afterwards was positively spitting with rage and contempt over being made to see a film about 'some psychopathic sociopath not Batman'. Heath Ledger evidently had to do himself in in order to kill off the blasted character seeing as Batman wasn't going to.
7201,True,"Only once every few years does a movie of this caliber get released, the last movie of recent days that impressed me as much as this film did was ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy so this film is now sitting, in my opinion, with the biggest films of all time.The acting in this film is mostly superb, i say mostly cause the performance of Maggie Gyllenhaal leaves a little bit to be desired and the voice that Christian Bale puts on when he becomes the dark knight is a little over the top plus some very average performances from many minor characters but Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are all excellent and so is Christian Bale for the most part when you look past the over done voice. For obvious reasons, I left one name out of the list and its the name everyone has been talking about since this movie was released, the sadly departed Heath Ledger.Heaths performance as the joker is beyond excellent, it puts him up with the greatest actors of all time including Marlon Brando and Johnny Depp. He undoubtedly becomes the Joker and throughout the film you never really see Heath Ledger you are looking at Batman's most famous villain not a man playing him. I did have doubts when i first heard they were casting Heath as the Joker but obviously my doubts have been put to bed.Now, what makes this film great is not just the acting, its the storyline, the directing by Christopher Nolan and the all round production values are just superb and surpasses the excellent ""Batman Begins"" by a few miles. The only thing i will say against the storyline is that Harvey Dent's phase as ""Two-Face"" is way too short lived, they killed him off after about 45 minutes of the character being in the film which disappointed me a little cause Two-Face is an excellent villain.All in all a brilliant film that deserves all the hype and praise it gets and more with only a few very niggling problems that don't effect the overall score of this film one bit."
7202,True,"A thrilling, action-packed, visually stunning movie that had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish! Hands down, the very best of 2008! It's impossible to imagine a more perfect film! Christopher Nolan delivers the prime example of what happens when so many perfect things come together to make a work of art! A brilliant, exciting storyline matched with an intelligent, witty yet deliciously dark script, makes the foundation for this incredible production. The look of the film, costumes, make-up, sets, locations all fit the atmosphere and make the Gotham City that this film requires. And now the big one... The actors make this film as mesmerising as it is! Not a single one of them can be faulted! Christian Bale is an amazing Batman and a great Bruce Wayne. He handled the change in his character really well! Gary Oldman is awesome as Gordon, Michael Caine is the perfect Alfred and all those gangsters are brilliant! Maggie Gyllenhaal takes over the role of Rachel very well and Aaron Eckhart is simply incredible! He plays Harvey Dent, Gotham's white knight with charm but also vulnerability and then makes an almost too believable transition into Two-Face! But the best of the best, Heath Ledger, of course! His portrayal of the joker is legendary! Such a change from his other, also great, roles, but just as real! You know that you're a convincing villain when you can make 30 year olds hide behind their jumpers!I could ramble on forever about this truly incredible film but, really, if you want to know what The Dark Knight is like, go and see it! It won't let you down! Promise!"
7203,True,"Normally i don't read comments from others before a movie, but now i did, cause i was wondering why this movie got such a high rating. A lot of people say its fantastic and i read some people who really hated it. Im not a Bat Man fan, though i had bat toys as a kid, a long time ago, so i went in pretty open minded.I still don't know why this movie got such a high rating. I fell asleep 2 times during it. OK, I'm a bit tired lately, but a good movie sure keeps me awake.The story is kinda lame. The classical batman story is good versus bad, pretty simple and straightforward, but the writers chose to abandon this theme more or less, stating that 'good' will always turn to 'evil', given enough time. Yea, sounds pretty deep, but isn't. Go read Nietzsche. I found it all pretty predictable and where it wasn't, it was too far fetched to ever be realistic. It leans on the psychology angle to pressure people to chose 'bad' over 'good', kinda like 'Saw' (and others), but not as good as that. Actually that theme gets worn out pretty fast. The pace seems way off, in the beginning i was like ""Huh, whats all happening?"", going way too fast, other passages are too slow (prolly where i fell asleep). The art of telling a story - any story - is to take the listener (or viewer) along for the ride with all possible means. This just doesn't happen. It's not the worst movie ever, but surely not the best either. The acting is pretty OK, Freeman and Caine always deliver. Batman obviously has a cold as soon as he puts his cape on, or watched Darth Vader too often and replicates it as a 10 year old. The Joker is totally not funny and where he should portray the madness, the only thing he knows to show is to stick his tongue out periodically. Didn't find him scary at all, not funny, nor interesting. They nominated the guy for an Oscar ?!?! The only reason i can think of why that is, is cause he's dead? I'm not saying his acting is bad, but it's by far not *that* good. ""You either die a hero, or live to become a villain"", has to be made true by awarding a posthumous Oscar?Effects and stunts are OK, but nothing new or exiting.All in all its doable, but i wouldn't recommend it to anyone over ~13. Gave it a 5, cause its not all bad. Maybe i just outgrew Batman.No, we're not destined to do this forever and in fact, before redoing a Batman, you need a really good angle on it. So think twice."
7204,True,"I read one review on here that says that they couldn't stand the movie because of the way that everyone moves their lips. Others say that it was ""painful to watch,"" and that the script was ""cringe-worthy."" However, I say that this movie deserves all the hype that it it stirring up. It is, at it's core, just an action movie. But somehow, it manages to come across as a much better Batman than it's predecessors.Maybe this is due to it's all-star cast (which includes the much missed but praise-deserving Heath Ledger for his role as the Joker), but I don't think that the fact that such good actors are in the film is the only crutch the movie can stand on.It contains a message that some people, perhaps the people who gave this film bad reviews, are to distracted by something shiny to notice. There are different kinds of villains, and just as there are different villains, there are different heroes. They come in all different shapes and sizes, and yet we need them all for a society to really function.Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is the White Knight of Gotham. He is the best kind of hero because he doesn't wear spandex, yet he saves the day, he's a part of society, but he's not afraid to get his hands dirty. It's been three days since I've seen this movie, and I still feel a part of me die when I think of the fictional Harvey Dent being covered with acid while he had to hear the woman he loved say her last words. Before this movie, I knew Dent as Two-Face, and nothing more. But this film added depth to his and many other characters, one of the things that made it great.The Joker, who we know from the other films as absolutely cuckoo, also gains a bigger back-story. We begin to really see the madness behind that madman in the Dark Knight. And, with much ""sorry""s to Jack Nicholson, I must say that Heath Ledger's Joker was much better than I'd expected, and much better than any other Joker. For once, the bad-guy explains his thinking without monologuing! How they did that is even shock worthy.As I mentioned, this movie doesn't lose all of it's action. The scene where Christian Bale blows up the truck and flips it over had everyone in the theater saying, without shame, ""Whoa..."" Yet, the action is on a level that no other action movies really are. The bomb triggers given to the passengers on the ferry boats conceal a thinly-veiled message to the viewers. ""Are you willing to kill to save?"" Of course, I believe that the triggers were really to their own boats.All in all, the martyr that Batman had to become and the film that enveloped that message, will always deserve the praise that it claims."
7205,True,"I tried to get through this. Really I did. And I could appreciate the effort that went into the performances and the wads of dough that must have been spent on special effects. The atmosphere too is lucidly rendered -- night time in the big city.But my enjoyment was hampered by the fact that I'd outgrown most of this stuff about the time I entered High School, and that was when the comic-book Batman still looked like a human being, not a bemuscled behemoth.The experience, the viewing of this, as much of it as I could stand, was exhausting. You have never seen so many vehicles, large and small, racing through the gloomy and deserted urban streets. And every one of them seems to crash and turn into an exploding fireball emitting shards of glass and flaps of unidentifiable metal.The business is taken seriously too. The blows rained upon the victims seem to hurt. The occasional wisecracks from The Joker don't begin to make up for the realistic pain.It all makes me wonder if our peculiar civilization hasn't entered the decadent period that precedes its fall from dominance. At least in the comic books you had to READ the dialog bubbles. Here, no challenge at all. Just sit back and let the despondency overwhelm you.I know, I know. I missed the point. It's just a fantasy. Right enough, but it's somebody else's fantasy, not mine."
7206,True,"When I saw Nolan's ""Batman begins"" I thought it was poorly directed - Not because Nolan is a bad director, but because this style of directing does not fit a comic. You can't take a movie about a guy in a bat suit too seriously and dismiss all comic aspects. Tim Berton knew this, directed accordingly (although this is also his usual style) and the result was a good movie. Nolan ignored this fact. The result was a movie that was not realistic at all, and yet tried to seem serious - an unintentional parody. The ""eastern wisdom and training"" montage clichés didn't help either.With ""The Dark Knight"", Nolan keeps making the same mistake, only this time its much worse. If the film is supposed to be realistic, you can't have so many unrealistic assumptions. One example: How is it the the Joker can get anywhere and do anything he want? He plants powerful radio activated bombs everywhere (it takes a whole company just to design these), He infiltrates the world's most powerful crime organizations etc. He keeps talking about how people start behaving like animals once you start disrupting their ordered world. But a plan of the Joker's magnitude would in real life require a huge, organized and coordinated group. Actually, in order to create ""anarchy"" in real life, you would have to organize and create a new form of order, so the Joker's point is moot.And that is just one of many contradictions I feel this movie has. That's OK for a movie that doesn't seem to take itself too seriously (like Berton's), but not for this one that seemingly aspires to be 'realistic' and to be taken seriously.The reason to give 2 stars instead of one: Superb acting by Heath Ledger."
7207,True,"After first 30 minutes I was about to get out of the theater but I gave it a chance, I left after 60 minutes.. Great cast, most boring plot, I know that probably it has great CG overload effects at the end and all the good guys win. I don't understand the actual rating for the movie, I expect it to fall drastically in the next few days. I suspect manipulation in here and it is a sad thing to see when the business takes over and the honest rating for the movie does not matter anymore.Great, I want 60 minutes of my life back and the money for my ticket.Don't spend money on that dirt.avrook"
7208,True,"I give it one star because of the headache-inducing over-storyboarded and dull midsection. A botched directorial effort by Nolan.1. Mid-point scenes of Harvey Dent character w/ Maggie Gyllenhall, scenes of Commissioner Gordon & cops etc. slowed movie down drudgingly with boring back-story- needed 20 minutes shaved off.2. Batman fight scenes had elbow jabs galore and looked like a blur.3. Choppy story editing in first half of movie swung from action scenes to modern high-rise scenes back and forth like a yo-yo. Felt like I was going up and down an express elevator- gave me a headache.4. Not enough Joker in first half. (see first aspect) 5. Two-face should've lived, but the special FX on him were overkill.6. The mayor, played by a too-young and effeminate looking actor with obvious mascara, looked ridiculous."
7209,True,"With such big hype on this movie, I am afraid that this movie will disappoint me but luckily it didn't. For me, the movie is a very well rounded movie in which it has everything it in...From Romance, to action scene, Inner conflicts, philosophies in life. I think it is nicely packaged into one movie. The Dark Knight isn't just a movie of Good vs. Evil, it goes more deeper than that. The storyline is very good. The development of the character especially that of Harvey Dent / Two-face is very good. At the end of the movie, I can say that I believe in Harvey Dent.Performances are very good as expected. Ledger didn't disappoint the people of his stellar performance. For me, I didn't really saw Heath Ledger in the movie. What I saw is a lunatic criminal named Joker causing terror to the Gotham City. Joker caught my attention because of his very terrifying performance, you never know what will happen next when he is around. Christian Bale does wonderful job for the Batman, and the portrayal of his inner conflict is nicely done. I am quite impressed on Aaron Eckhart's performance as Harvey Dent. Harvey Dent character really gave me a very good and lasting impression. I like how they develop the Harvey Dent character. Other A List cast did very well on their part as well.*Dunno if this is considered a spoiler... But one small criticism that I had on this film is the part near the ending. Somehow I felt that somehow things were a bit rushed and forced to make it that way...I felt that they could have put it in the next Batman film. But I think the ending was quite good and well done.So overall, the movie is not affected and is still very good. It want it 9.5/10 but since no 9.5, then round-off to 10/10. The Dark Knight didn't disappoint me despite of TOO MANY HYPES. It lived up to the expectation which is really rare in a movie after the bar is raised too high because of hype."
7210,True,"Admittedly, Christopher Nolan has been incredibly successful at what I would consider a doomed endeavor. After all, what sane director would try to fashion a realistic, rational universe from a sophomoric fantasy about a self-indulgent playboy with a costume fetish and a penchant for stylized bedlam? Still, I find the Batman premise more palatable when overshadowed by the fun spectacle of carnival freaks, kitschy art, and psychedelically rendered pulp lore. Without such accoutrements, the story largely relies on the poignant characterization of caricaturesa difficult task, to be sure. At times, Nolan tries to circumvent the problem by turning The Dark Knight into a didactic meditation on terrorism or a vehicle for its catch phrase, ""You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain."" However, terrorism loses its contemporary salience when exploited for plot and entertainment purposes, and Nolan seems reluctant to subject his protagonist to the implications of a dubious aphorism or to explore adequately the transformation of his less fortunate foil, Harvey Dent. Because each character serves as a mouthpiece for Nolan's ideas rather than a living manifestation of his themes, even a cast of capable actors cannot save some of the more unconvincing scenes. In the film's best moments, the camera lingers over a face or a cityscape and allows the image to transcend the script. Sadly, such moments are few and far between. Nolan reminds us that the Batman legend will always fail as social commentary because it focuses on allegorical, larger-than-life individuals while relegating the masses to cowering factions of homogenized corruption, selfishness, or ineptitude. Such a perspective underestimates humanity, which is lost in the frenetic whirl of action sequences on screen."
7211,True,"It just got so boring. Lots of silly chases and explosions and people doing dare-devil stunts. Whoop-dee-do! But what about the plot? What about a bit of realism in the way people would react to the stuff shown in this film. And what about trying to stick to the laws of physics when doing these ridiculous stunts.But mostly, I couldn't really care what happened to any of the characters in this film. I couldn't care less if Batman or the Joker got blown up or shot. And it just went on and on and on... Good grief, they could have cut an hour off and it might have been a good film.I kept looking at the time and thinking ""How long to go before I can get out of here?"".I see someone on the message boards has a topic ""I haven't met anyone who hasn't liked this film"". Well, now you have."
7212,True,"Well actually when I decided to watch it, my expectations of it were really really high because everyone around me had built it up so much. This is a movie of which sub-plots are all over the place with some wishful thinking of the director or the screenwriter. Joker is much too powerful. He's got many, many, many connections that he can even rig hospitals, blow up bridges, even manage truck drivers. If this is a superhero movie, where the hell is our superhero? Superman Returns was junk, too but at least it had a really blasting superhero movie opening. Where is Batman? C. Bale is a brilliant choice for Batman but there is not enough Batman but too much Joker."
7213,True,"I don't understand the big deal over the Dark Knight. Sure its OK and the actors are OK and all but its not GREAT. I believe that the movie wasn't all that great and was way to boring. My opinion is the movie is O.K. The atmosphere was the main theme of the movie, it was meant to shock us, gore us out and make us feel sympathy. It dragged on to long and by the end i was half asleep and was glad it was over. As soon as it started I was excited to be watching and by the end i was waiting for it to finish. Most of the actors irritated me. I laughed when the love interest died. She annoyed me.But the movie wasn't horrible. Im not saying its the worst movie I've ever seen - but its not one of the greatest. It definitely has no right to be up there with the greatest. No moment in this movie made me stop and think - wow this is good. If you like action you may like this movie but if you like non-stop excitement you won't.Sure there will be people out there who think that this movie is a masterpiece and there will be people out there that don't like it like myself. But I don't believe such a movie has the right to be called one of the greatest movies of the year, or of all time."
7214,True,"1. This movie at least attempted to be more than just a glorified cartoon -- by focusing on some exquisite moral choices/dilemmas, beauty/ugliness, loyalty/betrayal, etc. That is its main strength, IMO.2. This movie -- as others have pointed out already -- has SO MANY plot inconsistencies/totally unrealistic sequences (even for a fantasy flick), it falls BELOW cartoon-like in that regard. That is its main -- and most annoying -- weakness.As far as the acting goes -- the Joker clearly stole the show. But the problems weren't really with the acting -- they were with the totally unrealistic way the plot evolved. Way too many subplots; not enough glue holding the whole thing together.You have to give the director credit for trying to create something of epic proportions, but you also have to hold him accountable for failing to deliver on that potential."
7215,True,"Comic book movies as we know them are over. Gone are the special effects laden cartoons like ""The Incredible Hulk"" and ""Fantastic Four."" Consider this the ""official"" death of a movie like ""Superman Returns"" which was beyond terrible. ""The Dark Knight"" redefines the comic book movie and changes all the possibilities of where superheroes go and what they're capable of.There should be no doubt that the driving force in this film is the ever maniacal Joker. I wouldn't doubt the fact that he's probably going to go down as the greatest comic film villain of all time after being portrayed so brilliantly and effortlessly by the late Heath Ledger. The Joker never fails to deliver the most diabolical and sinister games that force all the film's heroes to have to make sometimes painful choices. In his own words, ""I'm an agent of chaos."" Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) realizes that to stop the Joker he has to become something he swore never to be. This results in an interesting turn of events that really can't be put into words, but I will tell you it involves a chase scene.The film really crosses the line in terms of the traditional comic book film in it's exploration of human nature and raises implications on social, political, and moral levels. The last time I saw a movie with that many themes was the multiple Academy Award winning ""Children of Men."" Personally, I've always felt films that use fiction to explore the current reality we live in or the ramifications of our decisions usually give us a cold, harsh, reality check. Christopher Nolan's screenplay and choice of dialog is more complex than any comic film, not to mention considerably more poetic. Gotham City let Batman operate without having to answer to the law. What happens when you give one man all the power? Gotham City District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) explains, ""When their enemies were at the gates, the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city. It wasn't considered an honor, it was considered a service."" His girlfriend, who also happens to be Bruce's ex-girlfriend Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), shoots back, ""Harvey! The last man to protect the Republic was named Caesar!"" A lot of these implications wouldn't be relevant if we weren't living in post 9/11 America, so I recommend you read up on something called Executive Unitary Theory to get the full effect of giving one man all the power.Apart of what made this film so hard hitting was the stellar performances. None of them were actors this time, they were actors who completely lost themselves in the characters they built, every one of which we come to care about. Lieutenant Jim Gordon's (Gary Oldman) promotion to Police Commissioner is well deserved. The movie also allows Oldman to take Gordon to new heights and really shows how Batman and Gordon are in this together, and Gordon as a character really comes of age.""The Dark Knight,"" in the end, wasn't merely about good and evil. It was about the fight for Gotham, and showing the city's people that you could overcome evil with good. Early on someone mentions that Harvey Dent is Gotham City's ""White Knight."" Dent is a handsome, well educated, elected official. The people paint the picture of him as this incorruptible force of good. Batman on the other hand, is a vigilante; a man who exists outside the law. People end up having more faith in Dent than Batman, but Dent fails. It's because Batman is there to take the fall that Dent, as a symbol, continues to thrive. People had faith in Harvey Dent and he fails. As Batman puts it, ""People deserve to have their faith rewarded, even if it means we have to hide the truth I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be."" This is what makes him the real hero, as Gordon puts it, ""He's Gotham's protector; our Dark Knight."" This is one of the year's best films. Go see it now!"
7216,True,"So Dean and I headed to Forest Hill Weds night to watch ""The Dark Knight"". Here's my controversial review.I'd been waiting to see this for a while, mostly because of how good ""Batman Begins"" was but also because of the rave reviews of Heath Ledger's performance, apparently his best since ""10 Things I Hate About You"". Went in expecting a truly classic cinematic performance...and i gotta say i was disappointed.The film starts out with a gripping bank robbery, done by some blokes in Joker masks. I got all excited when i saw William Fichtner as the bank manager who looked like he was going to foil the robbery, but alas his impact was minimal and he was soon dead. After his performance in ""Go"", he shouldn't be taking crummy roles like that. Anyway we're soon shown the power and craziness of the Joker and his desire to be Gotham's master criminal. Yep, the Joker is chilling but in what will be an unpopular opinion, I reckon you could have put Screech from ""Saved By The Bell"" in that make up, with those lines, and be about 80% as terrified. We're then introduced to Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart, in his best role since ""Double Jeopardy"") , the District Attorney with no fear and free from any ounce of corruption and Gordon (Gary Oldman, in his finest role since ""Air Force One""), the squeaky clean cop who is hell-bent on bringing down the city's crime. The Joker realises he must take down Dent,Gordon, as well as Batman to take the city over and hatches a brilliant plan to do so. Will he succeed? See it to find out.Now it was an OK movie, but way way over-hyped eg it's listed as No.3 on IMDb.com's all time best movie list. That puts it ahead of some pretty well known and respected movies ie Pulp Fiction, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, Casablanca, Psycho and Taxi Driver just to name a few. I thought it was a decent script, with an excellent cast, but the film just got to clever for itself at times, or at least for a Batman movie. Having said that I missed one or two key moments of the movie, probably due to agitation more than anything else ie that Gordon was driving the van with Dent in the back. I just thought it was weird that the driver wasn't talking and must have been a baddie. It was way too long, at least by 30mins and didn't have enough Bruce Wayne time.Solid, but I still prefer Batman Begins. Some will love it, some may think it was a tad overdone.FInally, ledger's performance was good but let's not get carried away and put it up with DeNiro as Travis Bickle, Al Pacino as ""Scarface"", Anthony Hopkins as ""Hannibal"" or Keanu Reeves as ""Johnny Utah""."
7217,True,"Having had to wait for 2 weeks before I had a chance to watch The Dark Knight, I was thrilled when the time came. After the first week of IMDb votes I kinda guessed there was some hype going on. But after 200.000 votes the grade was still 9.4. Was this still a hype or was the movie genuinely good? Also reading very positive movie reviews and hearing people go on and on about how great Heath was as the Joker, this meant the movie just had to be great, right? Well it's NOT. It's a good movie, but people who compare it to history's best cinematic productions are just out of their mind.Let me get to the first point of the hype: the Joker. I read reviews of this character being the most evil, terrifying, psychotic and creepy villain they had ever seen. I must agree that Heath does a great job of playing the Joker. But this just isn't living up to what I read and heard. The biggest problem with the Joker is that this is still an action hero movie, not a thriller or horror for that matter. What the Joker does made me laugh most of the time. I mean his opening with jamming the pencil through a guys eye may sound creepy when you hear or read it, but in this movie it's just hysterical. The Joker isn't scary or creepy at any point. He is psychotic, he is unpredictable and he is played with great depth (for a character that is flat in the script). But he can never compete with the great villains like Hannibal Lecter or even Jigsaw. Those are just out of his league. I would love to have seen the Joker develop more. The screen time for Heath is just way too low for him to carry this movie (although lot's of critics claim he already caries the movie, which would be a sad conclusion if you ask me). It's a shame Heath died.With that hype out of the way, the rest of the movie is pretty plain. It has great special effects and make-up, for which it'll surely compete for awards. But the other actors really can't deliver, even great ones like Freeman. Characters are not developed. Which brings the viewer in an awkward situation when we have to feel the pain that both Dent and Wayne feel when the lose Rachel, but we just can't feel that pain. That's just a result of poor script and poor character development.Good film, entertaining, but surely not great or superb. Get real people, look past the hype!"
7218,True,"First off, this isn't as good as Batman Begins. The story isn't as tight and the characters aren't as strong within the story. We are lead around rather haphazardly. Sure you could argue that this reflects the Jokers chaos, but the film doesn't particularly characterise him as all that chaotic. For every plan, the Joker has a backup plan, and as he spells out his and Batman's polar relationship, its quite clear that Nolan has chosen to depict the Joker, not as a crazy lunatic, but as a psychopath that has chosen chaos over order. The chaos of the plot simply leads away from the characters, and fills us with unnecessary schlock; the guy revealing Batman's identity (why? and if it was this easy to figure it out, why doesn't everyone know?), Gordon's death (again why? and isn't it plainly obvious that no-one is particularly grieving, and that he hasn't even made Commissioner yet?), the mobile phone sonar (pointless, included to keep Morgan Freeman in the movie, show off that they can think of gadgets, and include some special effects, get rid of it and have Batman figure out who is a hostage the old fashioned way), and so on. Nolan should have chosen to extend other scenes, focusing on enriching the main characters, such as Joker's taunting of the detective in the MCU before his escape.For all this, the film is enjoyable, and you don't feel the length. The action scenes are as exciting as you would expect and don't fail to deliver. Ledger's performance as the Joker is good, in my opinion only lacking in the characterisation provided by the plot. His movements are natural while remaining corrupt and psychotic. He could have been more menacing, or even aloof, the only real depiction of which comes in after he blows up the hospital in his dance away.This isn't Nolan's masterpiece but maybe next time!"
7219,True,"Let's get it out of the way first: Heath Ledger was fantastic. A terrific performance, but that didn't make this ""the best movie ever"" for me. I found Dark Knight over long and dull at times. Maggie Gyllenhaal is adorable, but she is not the ""great beauty"" that the role should be. Katy Holmes would have been more plausible. Why does Batman have this strange gravelly voice? I couldn't really get to grips with that. Two-face has perfect enunciation even though half his face is missing - what's that all about. It was a fun movie, but nothing fantastic. My 13 year old daughter LOVED it, but not her 43 year old mum!"
7220,True,"When I was a kid I taped the first Tim Burton's Batman from TV and I have truly great memories with that film (and with that tape), a 1989 film that I haven't watch since long time ago. I felt and I still feel an enormous admiration for Jack Nicholson and I think his joker was great but since I saw for the very first time Heath Ledger with the joker makeup and suit, I just loved the new joker. Yesterday I read again (now in a newspaper) the declarations of Jack Nicholson about the ""new"" joker and his words are even kind of ridiculous, maybe he was joking when he said that he should have been playing this joker since he can be easily the father or even the grandfather of Bruce Wayne. Today I saw The Dark Knight, on a midnight ""special"" screening just for the record, and even I still have those great memories of Nicholson's joker, I really don't remember feeling in the same way that when I saw Ledger's joker on the screen; he is absolutely fantastic just like this second take on Christopher Nolan's Batman, the second take and definitely my favourite of all the Batman films. Ledger's joker is the kind of villain, or better, the kind of character that you are just waiting for his next appearance, just to enjoy his presence on the screen and to enjoy the great character that is the joker. Of course as the joker becomes a character that itself makes a film worthwhile, he becomes the puppeteer of Gotham City, playing with the mob as if they were little kids and making a brilliant movement after a brilliant movement (the opening sequence is more than fantastic). This time Batman is not the protagonist but he is for sure the only one in who the joker feels respect or at least some excitement and the joker knows that Batman changed forever Gotham City but at the same time he knows how to play with him by making that Gotham City itself put the pressure on the hero and in this way Harvey Dent (a terrific performance of Aaron Eckhart and for me it was a surprise to see him on this film since I only remember him from Thank You for Smoking) will play a very important role since he is the real and new hero of Gotham City but he will live a situation that will mark him forever and that makes the film works in another level. And the joker likes to play on that level and is intelligence is simply amazing. The are some situations that are memorable in the film; I loved that the joker's origin is never explain and it seems that he arrives just to pull the strings and maybe it was because of his father or maybe because of his wife (I loved at both dialogs), who knows and actually it is not very relevant. But all of this comes back when the joker tries to put on his level ""regular"" persons and he succeeded for example with a cop who is full of anger when the joker ask him how many of his friends have died because of his acts but his most important success is on Dent who will try to put James Gordon in his same previous situation. On this level The Dark Knight is great with a story involving the classic corruption, the hopeless madness, the honesty and the meaning of the word hero yet the action is also great and exciting, starting with a memorable sequence, as I write before, just to grab your attention and it takes Batman, in a strange move, even to Hong Kong! But as I write before too, the joker's movements are just to follow and even we you don't expect anything he puts to the civilians the clown masks, tied guns in their hands and leaves everything for a civilian massacre. To talk about Ledger himself is kind of unnecessary since just after his suicide his joker became a cult character and also because we can resume all the performances in this film with only one word: great (I didn't missed Holmes and I'm glad that Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman and, specially, Gary Oldman are here again).The hype was huge and actually this is the first and probably the unique summer film that has that mentioned special midnight screening, you know to start watching The Dark Knight in the first minute of the day of its release (for the record, this is the first time that I went to one of this midnight screenings and I found some curiosities like that people likes them, the cinema was full which was really awaited, and that there are no trailers, you know to start exactly at 00:00), and that was my strongest card for this 2008 summer. I'm more than glad to say that I really loved The Dark Knight and on a personal level, this is my favourite Batman film ever. Tim Burton gave us two great films but now, well actually back in 2005 Nolan re- bird Batman and that was truly fantastic but The Dark Knight is even more fantastic. Don't miss the chance to see this one on the big screen!"
7221,True,"In my 43 years on this planet, I have never seen a more manic depressive movie than The Dark Knight. This movie alternates between insufferable, back-aching boredom to frenetic, hold-on-to-your-seat action. And most of the action sequences are amazing. It's probably worth the price of admission just to see the action sequences and Ledger's performance.It does not surprise me that this movie had FIVE WRITERS. I knew this half way through the movie before I even looked it up. How did I know this sitting in the movie? Four things will tip you off to multiple writers in a movie. (1) Haphazard, rambling direction. (2) Storyline on top of storyline on top of storyline. (3) The movie ends FIVE TIMES (one for each writer). (4) More than two hour running time (this movie is almost three hours -- remember the mess that was Spiderman 3??).From the very beginning, this movie seems to have no direction whatsoever. You could literally take the script to this movie and divide each scene up on separate sheets of paper, throw them up in the air, gather them up and shoot this movie again and nothing would change. That's how disorganized and haphazard the story proceeds. There are at least five side-stories, all of which are hard to follow and difficult to understand how they fit in to the overall story (blowing up two ferries?).BY FAR the most annoying part of The Dark Knight is Christian Bale's unbelievably over-the-top, angst-ridden portrayal of Batman. As Bruce Wayne, he delivers a great performance. When he straps on the gear, he becomes this growling, hilariously overwrought caricature of the Batman we know and love. He had people in my theater LAUGHING when he talked. It's a ridiculous performance and it's the director's fault.And, who is the annoying basset hound playing Rachel? Horrible actress. Not even remotely hot. I never thought I'd miss Katie Holmes.I'd rather see Iron Man fifty times before seeing this again.But don't let that keep you from seeing the movie. Ledger alone is worth the price of admission."
7222,True,"I fail to see how people are actually taking this movie seriously.Batman is meant to be an enjoyable superhero/comic book blockbuster, but that is all. The film makers feeble attempt to make things more 'serious' by throwing in the cringing ferry and solar phone tap scene were embarrassingly unnecessary and came off as patronising to the audience.Furthermore, the use of real NY style sky scrapers for Gotham City (in some far from subtle way of making more 9/11 America comparisons) ruined the distorted and macabre atmosphere of Gotham city that Tim Burton had translated so well onto screen. The fictional comic book edge was further lost by showing us the Joker's violent followers from behind to expose their masks. While all this might have made the movie fresher and more realistic- why keep the entirely unbelievable and cackling Joker character? Instead, Heath Ledger's excellent performance feels out of place with the rest of the movie.And while Heath did play the joker very well, it is not exactly difficult to play a cartoon, fictional and face painted psycho. If you want to see a real Oscar winning performance of a psychopath, watch Monster (2006). If he gets the Oscar sympathy vote for this I would have no more respect for the Academy and it's flawed voting process."
7223,True,"After the excellent Batman Begins, I expected this sequel to be so much better, instead we are left with one big mess of a movie. Don't get me wrong, all the actors do a splendid job with their roles especially Heath Ledger (RIP), however the film itself is just not very entertaining at all. In fact, this is hardly a Batman movie itself, the film focuses more on cops and corruption, which is fine so long as you remember that your supposed to be watching a comic book hero.The problem here is there is too much going on, and with little explanation, the film starts to get very confusing, as you start to wonder who is really the hero and who is the villain. Batman's Gotham City now looks more like New York City, and his Bat cave is absolutely horrendous, not to mention his irritating voice.In its defence, the actors perform well, and some of the special effects are quite good, especially the opening scene where Batman kicks butt, only trouble is, its well too brief. If your going to watch The Dark Knight in terms of action, then you will surely be disappointed as there really isn't much action at all, only about fifteen minutes at the most.If you want a proper comic book superhero movie, I recommend Iron Man (a far more entertaining movie), or even the second Hulk movie with Edward Norton. Its just a shame, that this second Batman movie was not what I expected, and after the brilliant Batman Begins, The Dark Knight is a big disappointment. Take my advice; stick to the excellent Tim Burton classics, they are far more entertaining and faithful to the comics. Or just watch Batman Begins and skip the sequels."
7224,True,"OK, I know I am not that well versed on all the action comics from which these movies are made, but this Batman was one of the worst films I have ever seen that is based on an action figure.True, the acting from some of the main characters was very good,the Joker by Heath Ledger and Batman by Christine Bale,(although his Batman voice gave me the creeps) but,having seen the movie four hours ago all I now remember is Car Chases, Explosions, A hospital Being Blown Up,(the noise was so LOUD I had to hold my ears)and such intolerable camera work that I became totally dizzy and had to look away. It took me a long time to know who was who..maybe I am slow to understand, but the plot was so incomprehensible to me jumping from scene to scene that I kept looking at my watch.Where was the real fun that I remember? Even that old Batman Series on TV in the 80's was so entertaining.. Robin,the Penguin,Catwoman..and the plot was so SIMPLE..no Digital enhancements...just good scary fun for the kids!! Remember the on-screen ""BAM""..""ZOOM""..""KERPLUNK""..etc?? It was FUN..FUN!!for adults as well as kids. How could kids feel comfortable watching this..a gun held to the head of a little boy!..so much darkness..and things Blown Away!! How this could be rated #1 in theaters is all about HYPE..the death,sadly of Heath Ledger, who I thought was an unforgettable Joker but a little scary for kids! I kept asking my son ""Who are the good guys and who are the bad ones?"" It really left me empty! The script was boring..the dialogue empty and the acting predictable. I loved ""The Fantastic Four"",""Spiderman"",and ""The X-Men."" They had clever scripts and good character development. In ""The Dark Knight"" ..there was none of this!Please..to parents out there, don't WASTE your money and don't SCARE your kids...this movie is boring, loud, and an utter disappointment..I do not care how much Money it has made so far!! Wait for it on DVD or do yourself a favour and PASS on this mixed up melange of drivel!!!"
7225,True,"I am at a loss for words. The Dark Knight was hyped so much that I was tired of hearing about it.... But every bit of hype was well deserved... extremely well deserved... Heath Ledger, its a shame the man passed on.. His performance was incredible, not just as the joker but as a supervillian in a movie. He pulled off what the great Jack Nicholson wished he could and don't get me wrong, Jack's performance was great but Ledger made me forget while watchin the movie that good ole jack ever played the joker before.. Please see this movie, its flawless, and I mean FLAWLESS. Christopher Nolan did an excellent job.. Its not just a good batman movie its a great standalone movie"
7226,True,"****WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS HERE*** This movie is a monumental disappointment. I had seen all five of the previous Batman movies on the big screen, and I watched as they kept getting worse and worse and worse. I hoped that this one would break the trend (and with all the raves surrounding Heath Ledger's ""great"" performance, I really thought it would), but it did not. This movie is so trite and so absurd, and what is most reprehensible is that it suggests that there is no Good vs. Evil anymoreas a matter of fact the movie closes with Batman himself being chased by the Gotham Police(!). And constantly throughout the movie Batman (now suddenly called ""The Batman"") is seen as being the reason behind all the murders, robberies, and destruction the Joker is perpetrating in Gotham City. By the way, Gotham City here does NOT at all look like the Gotham City that we know; it is Chicago pretending to be Gotham City, which is very boring. What happened to the stunning production design that Gotham City is supposed to have?!! As for Heath Ledger, he makes a great impact in one of his first scenes in the movie (when his sudden killing of a gang member serves as the punch line to a joke), but after that scene the Joker's energy totally dwindles away and he becomes another smart-aleck, philosophical killerand even downright boring. In an attempt to keep things entertaining with the Joker, the movie resorts to dressing him in a nurse's outfit (a cheap laugh). To make a quick comparison, ""The Dark Knight"" is very much like ""Live Free or Die Hard"" (and a million other movies) in that everything is on the verge of complete destruction and chaos at the hands of a villain, and like Die Hard 4 (When are needless sequels going to stop?!!!!) it tries to replicate the feel of 9-11a real-life tragedy that should not be incorporated into comic-book stories like Batman. Batman himself makes a pathetic showing in this film, as he is much clumsier and more ineffective against the villains than ever before. But then again, why should he even try when everyone is calling him a ""vigilante killer""? When I was eight years old and saw the first Batman movie at the theater in 1989, seeing my favorite comic book character brought to life in such a stunning way was a dream-come-true. Had ""The Dark Knight"" been the movie that was released instead in 1989 (especially seeing Batman getting chased by the cops at the end), I would have been devastated. Now as an adult, I can honestly say I am disappointed."
7227,True,"When this film came out, I initially expected it to be just as good as its predecessor, or better. I found Batman Begins to be a very enjoyable movie, with likable characters, terrible adversities, and a fittingly dark atmosphere.After seeing The Dark Knight, I don't see how it can compare.The main problem for me is that this film turned out to be another mushy, woe-is-me pseudo-epic in which the hero does little more than gripe about his problems. Granted, every hero can and should face problems of all sorts, as that is what a story is all about. But all Bruce Wayne does in this film is monologue about how his alter ego has become a new villain (which I never understood) and how he is considering hanging up the cape. So much whining and so little crime-fighting makes Batman look weak.Heath Ledger did a fine job portraying a crazed psycho-killer, but I have to ask the question why he bothered to play such a deranged character at all. I saw the Joker as a villain with a sense of humor, who did terrible things to the citizens of Gotham while throwing off rather lame one-liners and laughing crazily. Ledger's Joker has no sense of humor as far as I could tell, and there is not a single one-liner (lame or otherwise) to be heard. The only time Joker ever laughs is when he is about to cut into another victim or when the Batman is kicking him around the interrogation room: one of the few scenes in the film where the Batman really does anything.Heath Ledger's Joker is also all-powerful. He engineers enormous schemes, almost all of which involve rampant use of explosives, and pulls every one of them off without the slightest snag. He's always at least ten steps ahead of his enemies throughout the movie. The police mindlessly fall into every trap he sets for them almost as though he could see into the future and therefore act accordingly. The Joker is never really stopped, either: in the end, the writers really leave his character hanging... literally.In between Batman's depressing homilies and Joker's demonic mischief, the rest of the film's uncomfortable length is packed full of purposeless explosions, graphic deaths and a cool but needless car chase, all of which do nothing to further the almost nonexistent plot. And to top it all off, in the end Batman flees from the police into the shadows in one of the most confusing endings I've ever seen. The film plays out like a nightmare, not only because it is filmed in such a manner, but because it leaves the viewer with the depressing message that, at least in Gotham City, evil always triumphs over good.In summary, it is a nightmarish and overly long film that could have been a lot better. Great special effects, no plot.3/10"
7228,True,"I fail to see what is so brilliant in Batman ""The Dark Knight"". Is it the title? Because it certainly not the film itself. Let's start with what is (if not Oscar worthy) goodIn ""The Dark Knight"" the acting is not at stake. Special mention to Heath Ledger; he managed to do something interesting with the character of the Joker. Tough job as the Joker's past is indeed a mystery. All we know in the film is that his motivation is fairly limited. He just wants to bring chaos not so randomly it seemsIt is hard to embody someone with as little background elements as water in the Sahara desert and a motivation as thin as air. Plus the script did not really help with the endless version on how he got his scars. However Heath Ledger manages to deliver a good performance by playing a pretty generic sadistic psychotic. Christian Bale is hard to judge. Spending most of his time in a bat suit doesn't really help to determine whether or not his performance is good. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman do so little than even the credibility they are supposed to provide is inexistent. Finally Aaron Eckhardt plays a rather uninteresting Harvey Dent; His ""Two-Face"" part is too short to indeed develop his character. To close the acting chapter I have to point out how poorly written the script sounded. I didn't get away with one memorable quote. Not a good sign On to the film itself: very well shot even though one has to regret in the opening shot the reflection of the edge of the helicopter in the building's glass. Moreover did you notice how generic Gotham is depicted? Some would have you believe it was a deliberate choice to make Gotham looks more realI tell you it was driven by laziness and zero artistic vision. This is symptomatic on how seriously the film is taking itself Secondly I profoundly questioned the coherence of the film. Let me push forward my evidences by throwing at you the questions that popped in my head while watching the film from the most trivial to the more important ones: Why can the dogs chew on the bullet proof bat suit? Why a witness could pull a gun on a Lawyer while being on the witness stand? (body search anyone?) How the Joker manages to keep a pencil straight on a table while a dozen of gangsters are trying to reach out to him for a good old hand to hand Fight. Why the most famous patient of a hospital under terrorist threats can't be evacuated? Why the Joker would sets fire of a dollar bills pyramid? He said that money is not important to him. What's important to him is bringing chaos. But then why would he rob banks for a living then? Why is Bruce Wayne so obsessed with an ugly girl? How does this Sonar thing works? How could two Ferry Boats live the shores full of petrol barrels without any crew members noticing a thing? How can the Joker blow out an entire Hospital despite announcing it? Can someone explain the strategy of Police Commissioner Gordon who pretends to be dead so that the Joker will focus on Harvey Dent instead? Why is Harvey Dent mad at Police Commissioner Gordon and Batman more so than mad at the Joker? Would you? Why is Batman endorsing the crimes for Harvey Dent? Couldn't Gordon and Batman agree to use the Joker as Scapegoat? I know it seems like I am writing the ""Cantique"" of Nitpicking but there are way too much small incoherent things in the plot to make the whole film stands on logical ground. Christopher Nolan wanted to redefine the notion of Hero by proving that there isn't such thing as PerfectionThe Dark Knight proves if need be that everybody has flaws. Batman has flaws he has a dark side. The bright shining knight, Harvey Dent has flaws. Both of them can become as dark as they were shining onceBut are we ready to be confronted with the dark side of our Knights? Are we ready to rage War on Terror? Are we ready to give away some of our Freedom? Things will get worst before they get better. But during those darken days our very Society will be at stake. Christopher Nolan did a very good job in refreshing the Batman Series. Certainly I liked the job he did with the first one, encapsulating the film's Mythology in some kind of possible contemporary Reality. But too much is too much. Here it appears ridicule at best, chocking sometime and often incoherent. As a director scaring people is an easy thing to do. Depicting the process of Fear is way more difficult. Time of hardship is here. We don't know where we're going and it's quite something to live in fear. We need a light, we need Knights. But do we need darken Knights? One thing for sure, there are no ""Shining Knights""... So at the very least we need to understand how fear transforms into courage sometimes and how the control of this courage and the course of action are important and can't lie in the hand of one Man or a few. The problem is, Batman ""The Dark Knight"" lacks any understanding of the danger of Fear. Whether it is the Fear of one Man or the Fears of a given Society"
7229,True,"There are no flaws in TDK. The acting, the story, the characters, everything was absolutely amazing. The highlight of this movie is obviously Heath Ledger. His brutal, haunting and somehow charming performance perfected this movie.Christian Bale did great as Bruce Wayne/Batman. Though the character didn't emote as much as I thought he shouldve but its not CB's fault its the writers.Aaron Eckhart did great in the transformation of 'the hero' to 'the villain' Great great performance and cool effects on his face.All in all its a pretty amazing movie and i recommend it to anyone and everyone"
7230,True,"This movie can be put into so many words, but here's just one...EXCELLENT. Once again Christopher Nolan teams up with the wonderful Christian Bale with also some other new characters like The Joker which is definitely the best Villain I have ever witnessed in my life. Heath Ledger(1978-2008) gives his best performance ever in this movie, totally Oscar worthy. Harvey Dent, which is played wonderfully by Aaron Eckhart, especially when he becomes Two-Face. And then we have Maggie Gyllenhaal who gives a terrific performance as Bruce Wayne's love Rachel Dawes. Please do go see this film you will be very glad you did."
7231,True,"What fantastic set pieces(the escape in the Chinese office building was as good as you'll see) and stunning performances all round, also visually brilliant but I thought that the plots were over cooked, there were just too many twists and turns for my liking, to me it seemed like the quantity of twists and turns would give it more merit in the eyes of the director. It almost seemed like two or three movies rolled into one, yet there was no great plot. There was a very rushed character development of Dent to two face.. just up out of his hospital bed straight into a killing spree really. The movie was two long, the pacing was a little scattered at times and some of the dialog seemed old hat to me, I thought it started to lean more toward a Tim Burton take on the franchise, I did love the Burton movies but I loved what Nolan was doing too, his raw back to basics model added grit and a very dark reality. It bothered me that it was borrowing heavily from the James Bond ""Gadget Demo"" scenes when they were inspecting the gadgets and Bruce accidentally sets off the device is told ""It would help to read the instructions master Wayne"" rings very much of ""Be careful Bond"" to me, what's next.. X-Ray specs?... and remember this is what the Bond Franchise themselves moved away from. I did of course think it was well worth seeing but disappointing after the hype I suppose. We really didn't get to spend any time with Bruce Wayne himself. Also Christian Bales Batman voice, it sounded waaay to put on, laughable in fact. All this said I'm simply trying to put into focus what I've seen, it is very good but not the greatest film ever made. Thanx, OTCii."
7232,True,"One has to sit through a lot of idiocy in this sado masochistic wet dream in order to glean some exciting moments as this loud bombastic endless piece of highly polished garbage bashes it's way to a sequel. Given the running time there are plenty of thrills and chills that more or less simply repeat themselves for the last hour by which time it becomes a race between losing interest or your hearing.Gotham City is in danger of being picked clean by the mob. Only crusading DA Harvey Dent and Inspector Gordon stand between them. Enter the Joker, a sadistic yukster who can't get or deliver enough mayhem to all concerned. Even Batman has his hands full with the cruel overly optimistic and principled (it ain't about the money) bad Bozo. Now the stage is set to destruct much of the city, kill and injure much of the populace and give the Joker every opportunity to escape.Batman has always walked a fine line between fantasy and gritty realism (sci fi meets noir) that I felt succeeded when the tone was light. But this follow-up to Batman Begins allows even more darkness to seep in. The caped crusader is even more conflicted this time around since he's still sweet on his ex, now the DA's girlfriend. Then there is the impervious Joker. Still the energizer bunny to punishment he bounces back like a Joe Palooka doll no matter how bad the beating. After all if you kill him, you maim the sequel. The mirthful maniac, so crucial to keeping the train running is simply replaced by another less resilient villain.As Bruce Wayne, Christian Bale displays an ambiguous menace. As Batman he exchanges boiler plate philosophies (sprinkled with Bush administration policy) with cops and crooks sounding as if he has severe emphysema. It's hard to say if it's Heath Ledger or the make-up that makes him so ominous. Certainly the most sadistic Joker to date he lack's Nicholson's breezy take and better cosmetics as well as TV Joker Caesar Romero's boundless comic energy. But even with an Uncle Fester intonation he is a disturbing and convincing example of the fearless nihilist.Director Chris Nolan pours the chaos and carnage on like syrup with sensorial disregard. There's a well edited bank heist at the beginning of the film and Batman gets to tool around Gotham in a really cool motorcycle (Bat cycle?) but the biggest budget on earth (this may well have been) cannot disguise the fact it it is an inferior work to his gripping and imaginative Memento. Like another Indy phenom Steven Soderbergh he has chosen to sell out (Who can blame him, who wouldn't want a piece of the film gross?) to make bloated shiny movies that make a lot of noise and cash. The Hollywood moguls gain is the art house loss with this one time original filmmaker.The evolvement of Batman from the unique comic book crime fighter to the satirically brilliant TV show to the mega monster super film franchise has gone through many transformations to date. From the record breaking box office returns most would agree that it's for the better. Call me sentimental but it will never improve over the comic I would read twice while sitting under the maple tree in my yard and then trade even up with my friends for a Flash or a Green Lantern. Loud as this slick and crass masterpiece of marketing is it will never deliver the bang for the buck that the pages of the comic fed my imagination without all the noise."
7233,True,"Films like these don't come along very often. Perfect acting, directing, music, characters, story, cinematography and so on. To me The Dark Knight is one of those examples that will be remembered for a very long time to come. Everything that has been said about how wonderful this film is is true.The action is massive and beyond epic. But in-between the high flying punches and explosions its the acting that sums up this mastery. All the actors prove their worth as masters of their profession.Christian Bale has characterised the greatest Batman ever. His portrayal as Batman is brilliant and we finally witness this characters struggles, ambitions and morales all onto screen for the first time.Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker is so chilling and monumental, menacing and pure that no other actor could had pulled that off. His presence on screen lights up and your left with, what i consider to be the greatest performance by any actor.To conclude, The Dark Knight is a perfect film. Perfect in a sense that i think has never been seen before and that wont ever be seen again.R.I.P Heath Ledger"
7234,True,"This is a great movie. Joker was spot on, very scary and funny, I love the editing in the suspense scenes. But to be honest, the main character is Harvey Dent. This is his best version since in Batman TAS. A full story, the greatest character development he could have been given, as we see the potential in him when he tosses the double headed coin and so on, with great foreshadowing (You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain) and there is a great payoff. The acting was amazing too. Very menacing. I mean, you can't possibly complain he got shafted. In Batman Forever he got shafted. Just a Joker ripoff without any sympathy, and we didn't want him on screen. Here, though, he has genuine pathos. We see the greatest of men, the most honorable and honest man who had a real chance to make things better, fall. He really didn't deserve it, and we all feel for him. He loses everything, and he has done nothing wrong. He isn't even insane in the end. He's just torn and defeated. And when he aims the gun at the kid, we really think that he can kill him. And when he is defeated (I won't say dead, he might be in the sequel... why kill the goose that lays the golden eggs?), we realize that he is a victim. A victim of the Joker on the outside, and a victim of himself on the inside. That is why I think he is the greatest character in this film. Also, he looked great. Was the scarring CG, prosthetics, or both? Surely, though, with all that open skin, he would contract some kind of disease and get infected? Doesn't matter. If Heath hadn't died, both him and Eckhart would be praised as equals. But now that I'm done with that, let's get on with the Joker. Before I saw the film, I heard that he was great, but I wasn't convinced. The trailers did seem second rate to me, I admit. He wasn't scary enough there. So when I heard how great he is in the role, I took it with a grain of salt... until I saw the film. I was literally TERRIFIED of him. Even when he was funny. I really thought he would kill everybody who mattered. And he did, I guess. He played a psychopath who wasn't really insane. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I realize that he wasn't a psychopath. He was a sociopath. He only cared about his own well being... Wait a minute. He didn't. We need a new word for this guy. Maybe he had a sort of super-sanity. On first glance, you think him completely insane. But he's actually a genius, using Gotham as a petri dish to do his social experiments. Why? Because, deep down, he wanted to prove that everybody was like him. I remember reading a comic about the Joker where psychiatrists in Arkham find an essay about how the Joker isn't really insane. If he was insane, he wouldn't have been able to pull any of his crimes off. It concludes by saying that with this as proof, the Joker should not be charged as insane and locked away, but be put to death. The psychiatrists then learn that it was written by Harley Quinn before she went insane. That means that this file would not be taken seriously by a judge and Joker would still be classified insane. That comic never convinced me. He always seemed batty to me. But this film... he isn't crazy. He is probably more sane than anybody else, actually. Just cold and uncaring.There are times that he does seem insane, like when he goes nuts laughing while jumping on Batman. But he is really a calculating genius with incredible foresight. And I think it's a shame that we can't have Heath back. He showed complete acting skill when doing his rants and monologues with a straight mind, if not a straight face. The scene where the hospital doesn't blow up, and he keeps hitting the button until it does, is unscripted. I've also been hearing that there's a (false) rumor that he was on drugs while doing the scenes. If his eccentric acting can start rumors like that, an Oscar nomination would not be out of pity. It would be justice. His character can probably be written off with a death penalty in the sequel and it would make sense, but I would take that over a replacement (unless an obsessed fan named Harley decides to continue his work.) As for Batman himself... I never believed that you can hide your identity from your friends with a mask until now. Bale played two people. They can't possibly be the same person! Also, we finally realize in this film that Batman is not a hero. He does very immoral things in this, like eavesdrop on everyone in Gotham. And you just can't make an excuse for that. He is clearly in the wrong, even if it's the only way to do his job. And with the almost complete lack of CG in this, everything Batman does seems possible by human standards. And, of course, he gets attacked by dogs. Of course he would. It was delightful when he gets attacked by dogs again and his suit keeps them from killing him. Gary Oldman's Gordon was incredible in this movie. He had such a big role, and it was pulled off perfectly. He had better be in the sequel. I give the Dark Knight... A+, or 10/10"
7235,True,"'The Dark Knight's box-office takings were recently overtaken by those of 'Toy Story 3'. Frankly, I'm not at all surprised. The Disney picture blows this away in terms of sheer entertainment. What Christopher Nolan does not seem to have grasped is the utter absurdity of the main character - 'Batman' is a nut who runs round Gotham City in a rubber suit solving crimes. The 1966 series/movie with Adam West and Burt Ward got him about right - it was played entirely for laughs. 'T.D.K.' takes him very seriously indeed - big mistake. Christian Bale is bland as 'Wayne/Batman', and Heath Ledger's 'Joker' cannot hold a bat-candle compared to Cesar Romero's and Jack Nicholson's earlier portrayals ( had Ledger not been foolish enough to die just before the film opened, I doubt whether anyone would have given it the time of day ). 'T.D.K.' also squanders the talents of the lovely Maggie Gyllenhaal ( brilliant in 'Secretary' ). The film as a whole is bleak, ugly and depressing - not my idea of a fun movie at all. I think I'll stick with the excellent Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher quartet of the '80's/90's. No more 'edgy' Batman pictures, okay?"
7236,True,"Sorry, But this movie was trash! Had a few good moments, but that's about it! A waste of over two hours of my life I won't get back.Time to put Batman to rest!Heath was a good actor, But sorry. His performance is NOT worth a Oscar NOD.Let Heath RIP!!There are far better movies and actors out there that deserve the Oscar NOD.I am just glad I rented the movie and did not waste time and money paying to see it in a theater.I was never so happy to see the credits roll up before!"
7237,True,"I went to see this godawful turkey because the reviews were good and I thought maybe there was something there worth seeing, but, alas, my instincts were correct: it was made to be delivered to the Faithful, who prefer their characters flattened out and wrapped in plastic against a blue screen, delivering the usual predictable, crappy comic-book dialogue. There goes another five or six hours I'll never get back. One of the worst aspects of this movie experience was the ever-present, omnipresent, ubiquitous, portentous, ominous and and and redundant symphonic music! Every single second of screen time is infused with impending dread....! Christian Bale stares longingly into Maggie Gyllenhall's eyes; tremulous, haunting minor chords. Christian Bale glances away at the darkened spires of Gotham; slow crescendo on B flat. Etcetera. I guess this film was just marketed too effectively; I was convinced, and went. The first Batman film starred Michael Keaton as Wayne, which was an inspired casting choice, much like casting Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron Man: it would be impossible, I think, for either Downey or Keaton to yield up a flat performance. In this case, though, Christian Bale's performance (primarily grim determination) has been flattened out to match the furniture, leaving only Heath Ledger and, of course, Michael Caine, still standing as convincing characters.Is that enough to make the film worth watching? It's up to you, but (A) I knew it was the last I would see of Ledger, and(B) the script for Michael Caine just isn't THAT good. On balance, I can't recommend it."
7238,True,"I'll have to admit, I was not keen on seeing this movie, just because I didn't really enjoy Batman Begins, but I had some hope this movie would be an improvement. And it was... slightly.I did like Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker, besides having no back story or anything like that. Does it deserve an Oscar nod? Not really. I think that's mainly out of the fact that he bit the big one earlier this year. That and he was supposedly going insane while(or because) he was taking on the role, so I guess the acting wasn't much of stretch, then, was it? I have to admit, the direction wasn't very original or spectacular. But besides that, the movie was chalked full of big BANG BOOM action scenes. The scenes that dealt with dialogue seemed to be trying to make up for the lack of action with cheap humor that wasn't all that funny.Rachael Dawes, the most pointless character in the new series... What can I say about her? Other than no one really seemed to care about her or her death. The only reason I feel like she returned for this film was to give Harvey Dent a reason to go nuts and start whacking people.Which brings me to Two-Face... Was it necessary to shove that villain into the last part of the movie like a bad subplot? I think it would've been more appropriate for him to have his own sequel, but I guess the writers really didn't think he deserved that.I also feel like everything in the movie was so forced together. I mean, 3 villains in one movie and none of them hardly interact. I mean, you got Scarecrow briefly cameo-ing his way into the first little bit of the movie. I don't mean to compare the movie to Burton's works because that's biased(and screw you, because I am) but Batman Returns had all 3 of it's bad guys smoothly fit together in the film... was it really that hard? The last thing I really did not like in the movie was Christian Bale's ""I-Must-Sound- Like-I'm-an-80-year-old -woman-who-has-cancer- and-still-smokes-after-60- something-years"" voice.Other than those things, the movie was okay. Does it deserve a 9.7? To be above the likes of Pulp Fiction, Alien, Aliens, Psycho, Grindhouse, etc? Not really. I think the movie has lost itself in the hype and most of the people who gave it a 10 did so because they didn't understand half the movie, but thought it looked cool. I think the movie would sit nice with a 6 or 7.something rating, but that's my opinion.Anyway, I will be not be seeing any more films in this version of the series, so you won't hear from me about it again."
7239,True,"Granted, I'm not a huge ""splosion"" fan, but walking out of the theater after just seeing this film, I am appalled. I feel like a Roman who has just witnessed a tiger maul a man. Why wasn't this rated R? Why do we as a society think movies like this are amazing, let alone acceptable? I am an English teacher; the symbolism and social commentary were not lost on me, but at what point are dramatically violent scenes in a movie ultimately contributing to more violence in our communities? What price do we pay as a society to entertain our growing need to witness this level of destruction . . . using school buses to rob banks and murder? Blowing up hospitals? Pointing guns to children's heads? This has gone past harmless entertainment, particularly when it's witnessed by younger children (there were a number of 6-9 year-old boys in my showing that ended at midnight). Needless to say, I will not be seeing a third installment of the franchise, and will be encouraging people (at least the last five on the planet who haven't seen it) to avoid this film."
7240,True,"i really don't know what is on in this version of batman which made the record for all time box office, it was the worst. The Batman voice is very gay trying hard to be male. In every superhero movies, leading lady always be on perfect look, but not on Dark Knight. There is only one truth, it was totally dark.The story was adapted from Spider man 3.Lack of batman gadgets.Cast was boring. I can't see any good looking cast.On every fight scenes, Batman really obvious that it was handled by a real martial art expert and not the actor itself."
7241,True,"THIS MOVIE IS WEAK! Unfortunately, this film fails to deliver the same way Batman Begins did. The characters were mishandled (Nolan should do MORE research) and the acting was unsatisfying. Ledger did great, only he was NOT the Joker. The man hardly giggled. I'm sorry, but if you're going to play someone like the Joker, DO NOT go off on a tangent and try your own thing. In a medium like comic books, they're different from books in terms of we get visuals. We know EXACTLY what the Joker is supposed to be like. Ledger dropped the ball big time and Nolan should have done something about it. CELL PHONE SONAR?????????? That was awful. Two-Face looked good and Eckhart was an awesome choice but he had very little to work with. They should have given his character the attention he deserves, meaning his descent stemmed from his childhood, not his damn relationship with his co-worker. Gordon could have been good but he wasn't. Apparently he had to die to catch the Joker. WHAT? The ruse was mishandled. Let your audience know what's happening. Batpod? Whatever. NO BATCAVE???????????? Michael Caine plays an excellent Alfred only he had nothing to do. Does anyone recall the whole thing from Begins about Why do we fall? Apparently EVERYONE forgot it in this one. Everyone had a moral dilemma in this and that's fine, but WE DEALT WITH THIS IN THE FIRST ONE!!!! This is a damn superhero movie and why do people like superheroes? Because they beat up the bad guys. The fight scenes are poor at best because the camera is too close and YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS HAPPENING. I want to watch Batman kick the hell out of an army of jerks, not have it implied. These scenes were the weakest part of the film. Batman films, whether you agree or not, should have scraps like the ones in City of Violence or the hallway scene in Old Boy. THOSE ARE FIGHT SCENES! Does anyone know the plot of this film? Look, I know the Joker was supposed to be insane and never plan a damn thing BUT THERE WAS NO CLIMAX! Every scheme amounts to nothing and in the end of the film, THERE IS NO MOMENT OF TRIUMPH FOR THE BAT! Especially since they locked him up once and THE JOKER GOT OUT! WHY IN SWEET HELL WOULD THE JOKER BE AFRAID OF INCARCERATION?????? Plus, the scene at the end with the boats was a little too far-fetched (I know that's a risky thing to say since this is a film about a man who dressed in a rubber suit to fight crime). I mean, I just don't see people blowing each other up, especially when the National Guard is involved. WEAK! And back to that cell phone sonar thing: CHRISTOPHER NOLAN!!! BATMAN IS SUPPOSED TO BE A DAMN DETECTIVE!!!! WHY HAVEN'T YOU DEALT WITH THAT???? HE DOESN'T NEED THE DAMN SONAR TO FIND JOKER!!!!!! Ultimately, what kills this movie is the writing. Awful!!! David S. GOYER!!! STOP BUTCHERING SUPERHERO MOVIES!!! FIRST THE DAMN CROW (did you think I'd forget, dumb-ass?) THEN NICK FURY FOR TV WITH HASSELHOFF AND THEN BLADE (Goyer's third Blade, which he directed, SUCKED) AND NOW BATMAN. WHY DO THEY HIRE THIS MAN??????? People, this movie was terrible in terms of WHAT THEY COULD'VE DONE WITH THE MATERIAL!!!! If Nolan decided to do a third, he should FIRE himself because he cannot direct comic movies and TURF GOYER!!!!! There are some fine ideas in this film but they are masked by the garbage. The bank scene is great but the subsequent ones fail to deliver. All in all, I WISH I liked this movie. But if left me suspicious of a third and slightly hoping they'll reboot it again. I thought Bale was a great choice for the mantle but he phoned this performance in. If he doesn't step it up, get someone else or start over. Ugh."
7242,True,"Unlike their first entry in their Batman series, the Nolan brothers juxtapose their comic book characters against a well-lit Chicago urban backdropthey seem out of place in the real world and would have been much more at home in a make-believe noirish setting.The opening scene urges us not to take any of the antagonists seriously. As a bank robbery unfolds, the criminals end up double-crossing one another, shooting one another in the back. Only Health Ledger's Joker is left standing, collecting all the proceeds from the robbery. From the outset, the Joker faces no obstacles and appears almost omnipotent.The next thirty minutes consists of a series of very slow-moving expository scenes. There's a clash between mobsters and a few Batman wannabes show up (The leader of the wannabes is later captured by the Joker and in a repugnant scene is tortured in a video clip shown on the evening news). Cut to Bruce Wayne's 'Bat Cave' which looks more like a concrete bunker fitted with large high definition computer screens (so much for the neat old Bat Cave!). Michael Caine as Bruce Wayne's affable butler has little to do except impart pithy advice to his boss. Then there's the relationship between DA Harvey Dent and his girlfriend Rachel, who Bruce has an interest in (the love triangle never seems to develop). After Dent invokes RICO laws, the mobsters agree to allow one of their own, Lau, a Chinese Mafia accountant from Hong Kong to hold all their cash outside the US where the DA can't get his hands on it. Wayne then makes his way to Hong Kong where Batman manages to break into Lau's impenetrable skyscraper, kidnap him and return him to the DA where he's placed under arrest. Of course, this sideshow has nothing to do with the main plot which involves the Joker approaching the mobsters and agreeing to take half their cash in exchange for killing Batman. After the bosses refuse to go along with the Joker's proposal, one of the bosses, Gambol, puts a bounty on the Joker's head. The Joker then gains easy entry into Gambol's lair in a body bag, only to jump out and then kill the hapless criminal by slashing his throat with a knife (the point is made that the Joker is a sadist and the Nolans appear to congratulate themselves by emphasizing that fact over and over again without regard for good taste or an economical narrative).The rest of the film's extremely convoluted plot mainly concerns the Joker's efforts to eliminate his nemesis, The Dark Knight. The Joker declares if Batman doesn't reveal his identity, people will die each day until he decides to act. When the Police Commissioner and Judge presiding over the mob trials are assassinated, the public blames Batman. DA Dent concocts a plan to draw the Joker out by claiming that he's The Dark Knight. As Dent is transported in an armored car, the Joker attacks but is captured by Batman aided by Lt. Gordon who is soon promoted to police commissioner as a result of his heroic efforts in capturing the Joker.We never see how it happens but Dent and Rachel disappear and soon turn up as hostages at a warehouse. Batman gets a little rough with the Joker in jail and it's revealed that some corrupt police officials (they seem to be all over the place) were the one's who kidnapped the DA and his girlfriend. It turns out that one of the Joker's associates who he was imprisoned with has a cell phone implanted in his chest (don't know why he wasn't put through a metal detector) and when the phone rings, there's a huge explosion and the Joker and Lau both escape. Batman is able to save the DA but is unable to rescue Rachel. Despite surviving an explosion Dent's face is maimed and now he becomes the second villain of the movie, 'Two Face"".The unlikeable Joker proves even less charming when he declares he has no interest in money and torches Lau who is tied up in a warehouse on top of a giant pile of cash. Then in the most ludicrous part of the movie, the Joker visits Dent in the hospital and convinces him to take revenge on all the corrupt people responsible for Rachel's death. How the good guy DA could morph into a sinister criminal so easily just proves how silly the whole story is (instead of honoring his girlfriend's memory, he too conveniently becomes a bad guy!).The finale features a bunch of convicts and upstanding citizens held hostage on two separate ferry boats. The boats are rigged with explosives (how did they get on the boats undetected?). Each person on the ferries have the ability to set off the explosions but out of the goodness of everybody's hearts, no one can bring themselves to act.Finally, in the most distasteful scene in the movie, Dent attempts to kill Commissioner Gordon's son by throwing him over the side of a building. The killing of a child is not something that should be shown in a story that's supposedly taken from a comic book.Despite the absurd, overlong plot, The Dark Knight wouldn't have been so bad if the filmmakers didn't take themselves so seriously. Did they really have to rehash their point ad infinitumthat criminals are sadistic? Somehow a little humor could have humanized all the comic book characters and made the film a lot more enjoyable. Instead, the Dark Knight is an example of lazy screen writing where there is no interest in explaining one implausible event after another."
7243,True,"I don't think there has ever been a more powerful superhero film made to date that equals the greatness of The Dark Knight. Simply put, one must see this film.Even had someone not heard of the amazing portrayal of the Joker by the late Heath Ledger from the numerous high praise, they would still be flabbergasted at his incredible performance. Besting the choice of Christian Bale as Batman, Ledger is quite possibly the soul of this film, as each time his character makes an appearance, the room will go quiet and your heart will sink, pondering what he will do next.The story is basically Batman fighting the advancement at what seems to be an inevitable anarchy brought on by the Joker's ever-evolving mind. Harvey Dent -- the soon-to-be Two-Face -- James Gordon, and Batman each resemble a point on the morality spectrum, and as the plot continues to unfold, one must question what will happen to our heroes. Making this fantasy grounded to reality.There's hardly any CGI in this film, where it would be used is sometimes hard to be seen. The vast majority of the action and scenes are filmed with live everything. A brazen but ingenious choice by Christopher Nolan. Well done... well done.Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard provide a similar sound from Batman Begins, in that a lot of the themes used in that film have been incorporated here. There's a few new bits of music in here, such as the Joker's theme and a rousing battle cue.Overall, The Dark Knight is everything one could hope for in a superhero film. This is a dark film, probably not viewable for a child under 10 for the wicked left side of Dent's face once he has become transformed. With the ending, one can only pray to the heavens that Nolan will do a third, and pick up where we left off."
7244,True,"I loved it. Heath ledger was chilling, Maggie was a step up, Aaron Eckhart was really good, and Christian bale was good.sad, dark, and a masterpiece. bravo. the best part was: random Guy: do you think you can just steal our money joker: yeahI am glad Katie wasn't in it, her bad performance is no match for Maggies Oscar-worthy performance.two-face looked a little fake, but who cares. joker will from now on be known as the best villain ever. batman might be the greatest movie ever.in honor of heath ledger, a great actor among us, may he rest in peace"
7245,True,"So here it is. The most hyped-up, talked about and acclaimed superhero movie in... well, ever. Was it worth the wait? Yes Did it deserve the praise? Yes Did Heath Ledger surprise viewers who have had people nibbling in their ear about his portrayal for months now? Definitely yes. The film pretty much succeeds everything it sets out to do, and that's a lot. An epic crime film that has the similar layered and extravagant plots of something like Inside Man, The Dark Knight is far from a typical superhero film. There are psychological character studies of the Jokers anarchic destruction, Harvey Dent's shining savior and last but far from least Batman's role as the Dark Knight, the man who is above and below everyone else to do what they won't. The discussions in the film about who Batman is really defined what the character is all about and when the words The Dark Knight concluded the film I completely understood it's meaning. This incarnation of Batman is also the darkest. While Burton opted for Gothic quality, Schumacher for colorful campyness, Nolan has decided on a gritty and unsettling look at Batman. The story is unbelievably tragic and while I won't say much the film has far from a happy ending. It may not be the most entertaining superhero flick out there but it's certainly the best."
7246,True,"Jeez,where to start.Well first off I have to say that Batman Begins is not only my favourite Batman film but one of my favourite comic-book movies period.It was so good I was really looking forward to seeing this.Batman Begins looked and felt like a comic-book world, but it also had a dark tone to it and great acting which set it apart from the others.Now where did this go wrong. Well right from the beginning in all honesty.Just purely because as soon as the movie opens,you can tell that the director Chris Nolan has used a real city to stand as Gotham.In this case Chicago.Straight away you could see that it wasn't the same world as the previous film.The opening bank heist involving The Joker was good but it just looked like a scene from any crime thriller.This is supposed to be a Batman movie.For some bizarre reason the director thought he would make the tone very serious.Ridiculously serious.Now I never liked the camp tone of Tim Burton's movies,I much preferred the approach that Begins took but that film never forgot it was a comic-book.This does.It plays it so serious it just becomes ridiculous.Fair enough make the world plausible but at the end of the day it's still a story about a guy who dresses up as a Bat,in cooperation with the police and takes on strange criminals.This ain't Shakespeare for Christ sake.In a way the film is just as amusing as Joel Schumacher's efforts because it is so overtly serious that you can't help find it funny.So many ridiculous things happen,and because it tries it's best to be a crime thriller,these things stand out.And somehow Batman ends up becoming a supporting player in his own film.Something the director said Burton had got wrong and he would never do.Yeah right.It somehow manages to be overlong in length but too short in many scenes.It just keeps cutting back and forth between characters and sub-plots and mini sub-plots it becomes annoying.It just seems like a bunch of ideas thrown together without any logic.And Harvey Dent's sudden character change is laughable and Joker's anti-climatic end very frustrating.Here's the parts in the film that really annoyed the hell out of me.The Joker pulls up at the side of a police vehicle and starts shooting but the cops make no effort to shoot back and just carry on cruising along at the same speed.What the hell.Batman saves Rachel from falling off a building after The Joker crashes a party and the scene just ends.Seriously.This is a sadistic,psychotic killer we are talking about,are we really just supposed to believe that he would walk out and leave.Batman refuses to kill people but has no problem riding along on the Batpod blowing cars up to move out of his way.How would he know he's not going to kill someone doing that.And the main part that bugged me is in a sequence where Batman using some gadgetry flips over a truck with The Joker in and he emerges from the wreck conscious and unscathed.And yet immediately after,Batman somehow gets knocked out by coming off his Batpod which slowly he grinds to a halt.I was like WTF.I thought he was just pretending it was so stupid.The film doesn't have many redeeming merits at all and almost undid the achievement that Begins made.But not quite because that is still a great Batman film,unlike this wannabe crime drama with Batman and The Joker.A generous 6/10."
7247,True,"I finally finished watching this movie on DVD, and it was a big disappointment. It was very poorly made and very poorly written. The believability factor is almost zero. If the film was going for fantasy, fine, but it is seeking realism. There are many aspects of the movie which are completely unbelievable. While the Joker can not catch the armoured truck with bazookas and taking down a helicopter, somehow he could catch and tie up two of the main characters. How? We don't know. We weren't shown that. But he did it! In the scene where the helicopter is taken down, the armoured truck turned randomly from the underground passage to a street. So how did the Joker's men know which street to be on? Speaking of his men, where do they come from? Since he proves himself willing to kill and discard his own guys on a whim, why does anyone continue to work for him? What kind of mob boss shows up for the money with almost no guys? But the joker, who burns their money, he has lots of guys. This is the school of film-making where you can just write whatever you want. It's very apparent. That makes for a rather pathetic viewing experience. Near the end where Dent explains his motivation: I could not believe a film of such supposedly high calibre reached like that. It's like a kindergarten melodrama. And notice the two choices, either him or Batman. Why not Mr. X? Or Ms R? Or the Joker? No. No. We're writing this script the way we want to: stupidly.And by the way, you kill the Joker. Dead. Again, we see more and more in the pathetic school of film-making that has become somewhat dominant, the bad guys aren't killed, they just fall off a cliff, or stumble, or something. Why give the audience the satisfaction of watching this piece of crap buy a bullet."
7248,True,"I guess I missed the warning on the label.""You must be at least this shallow to enjoy the film."" This movie had no depth, although it really, really wants you to think that it does.Michael Caine was very good in this film. So was Morgan Freeman.But everything else was just so hollow. Nothing to draw one into the characters.And then the utter repetitiveness of the whole film. The Joker is a bad guy. The message which was relayed in the opening scene was then repeated again, and again, and again, and...And yet through all of this, they couldn't manage to put forth a story that was interesting. Nothing at all. Just excuses for special effects.Not as bad as Spiderman 3, but a really, really overrated film. Heath Ledger acts crazy throughout the film, but in a very, very two dimensional way.Ironic that a movie featuring a character called the Joker failed to have any laughs in it whatsoever.The first re-invented film was good. Things happened for a reason. Things happened that were surprising. Editing occurred.I would rather watch Adam West's Batman, than this. Those stories eventually got to the point."
7249,True,"Batman raises the stakes in his war on crime. With the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent, Batman sets out to dismantle the remaining criminal organizations that plague the city streets. The partnership proves to be effective, but they soon find themselves prey to a reign of chaos unleashed by a rising criminal mastermind known to the terrified citizens of Gotham as The Joker. We Can All Argue About The Quality Of This Movie Until The Cows Come Home But This Is What I Saw.I Saw An Extreme Amount Of Violence In A KIDS MOVIE (Its Like Making Dora The Explorer Into Punisher War Zone) And As Far As Flaws Go This Was Jam Packed. There Is This Nerdy Guy On TV Who Claims He Knows Who Batman Really Is Yet It Goes Nowhere...It Doesn't Take An Idiot To Figure Out That It Would Take A Millionaire To Afford That Crap.The Cell Phone Gag Was Idiotic. They Actually Could See Everything Including People Who Weren't On Cell Phones & When They're Trying To Find The Joker They Need To Wait Until He Speaks.Another Flaw That Is Pretty Obvious Is That A Gunshot Does Nothing To The Bat Suit Yet...A Dog Can Harm The Wearer.When The Bombs Are About To Be Activated The Sailor Only Just Finds Out The Thousands Of Gallons Of Flammable Liquid In The Engine Room At That Point.I Could Go On And On About This But What Really Pisses Me Off Is Its Place In The Top 250...So What Everyone Is Saying Is That Its Better Than ""Psycho"", Better Than ""The Seven Samurai"", Better Than ""Alien"", Better Than ""Seventh Seal"", Better Than ""Amadeus"", Better Than ""The Matrix"", Better Than ""The Terminator"". The List Goes On So Much That I Could Be Here Reviewing This Film For Days.As Far As Acting Goes Heath Ledger Is The ONLY Performance That Is Descent. Christian Bale As Batman Is Hard To Understand To Me What I Heard Is ""Ruta Ruba Runa Roo!"" This Might Sound Weird When You Say This Review To Yourself But Say It In The Batman Voice & You'll Find Similarities In Both Forms Of Dialogue. Hell This Isn't Even The Best Movie Of 2008. ""Iron Man"", ""The Incredible Hulk"", ""Let The Right One In"" & ""Hellboy 2"" Are The Best Because They Had...You Know...Thought Put Into It.I Realise This Review Might Get Slagged To Death Because I Insulted Everyone's Favourite Movie (Apparrantly) But In Every Decade There Is An Overrated Director. In The 70's It Was Copolla, In The 80's Its Spieldberg, In The 90's Tarantino & In The '00's Its Nolan.Overall I Think I Have Made An Okay Argument But I Also Expect Fans To Beat The Living Crap Out Of This Review Because ""Its Nolan"" & ""Heath Ledger Died In Shooting"" I Can Honestly Say That Not Every Movie That Has Had An Actor Died While Shooting Is A Good Movie...Take ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" Bela Lugossi Died While Making That & Thats The Same With This (I AM NOT COMPARING MOVIES!!! I WOULD NEVER DO THAT!!!) Heath Ledger Died But Now They Treat This Movie & His Performance Like The Second Coming. What Happened To Him Was Tragic But It Doesn't Mean That His Performance Is Legendary. The Only Time When A Good Movie Has Come Off The Death Of An Actor Is ""The Crow"".Rating: 1/10"
7250,True,"Batman is a comic strip! The Dark Knight thinks it's Dostoyevsky! Over long, exceedingly tiresome and boring, one note performances, stale CGI stunts with a script that is more pretentious than portentous! Director Chris Nolan gets some marks for subtly taking the rise out of Bush and America, and convincing a very large audience they are watching Fellini, Tarantino, M. Mann and Carol Reed all rolled into one! Yes, folks, if it's dark, it must be a serious film!!!! I loved the holes in the plot(must be deliberate), when The Joker says he is an anarchist, who does not plan, but then produces several stunts that would have required Rand McNally precision and hundreds of accomplices! And please,I know he died under strange circumstances, but Heath Ledger, although not bad,is miles behind Jack Nicholson. As for the rating certificate, the British censor should be thoroughly ashamed of himself, or did he think it was just a Tom and Jerry comic cartoon?"
7251,True,"Man, what the f**k was that ! There was a time when you knew how to deliver real thrills, set like swiss f***ing watches. That was 8 or 10 years ago. I'd have followed you anywhere, memorized every bit of your films, man ! Now, you're trapped in the Hollywood prestige. That's a bummer, man! Though, I dig your style, man: the ideas you put in the story, with the help of your bro. The way you shoot. The actors (hail to Heath), the production too. I even like you trying to make this man fighting creeps disguised as a bat as real as possible, even though I don't like that treatment for such a story and I think that a film based upon a comic should feel as a comic. But, fair enough, transposing Batman's mythlogy to today's reality is pretty cool. But, Man, what a waste ! Where's your point ? Where's the point ? Why don't you push your logic to the end of it ? Why so many gaps, holes, ellipses in you're story ? Why so many useless plots ? I mean, I was really keen on seeing a REAL Batman, man, but why do you use real locations like that for instance : everybody who's at least seen Chicago once on a picture should figure that it's not Gotham here, it's Batman in Chicago. Every Londoner should figure that it's not an abandoned warehouse here where Rachel is trapped, but it's Battersea Power Station. Now you could have at least shown a chimney, damn it. And that bit in Hong Kong... lame. Looked like a f***ing Roger Moore's James Bond s**t. And why so paradoxical, incoherent: Batman hanging up the mask and then 5 minutes later he is after the smiling freak again. Did you really think we would eat that kind of script tricks ? Explain that to me, Man ! And I'm afraid, Mister Nolan, that you can't direct action sequences (and can't rip other landmark movies properly either). That score at the beginning, was an insult to such a brilliant movie that is Heat. And this truck flipping over, now, come on, tell me, you had just watch Terminator 3 when it came to your mind, didn't you ? All in all, you f***ed it up, man ! But the Dude abides, he will wait for the next one. Suggest though you do a J before. You know, take it easy, man ! Stop brain wanking a little bit."
7252,True,"What?! Someone did not love this action-packed blockbuster? Blasphemy!I eventually watched the movie everybody is talking about last Friday. I gave a lot of thought whether I should write a review ...Well why not? I have been actively watching movies for over 35 years so I do feel I have an opinion to share.Why should I join the rest of the enthusiastic crowd, waving a red book and hailing director Chris Nolan as a genius?Now, don't get me wrong, I did not hate the movie...OK, let's start on the good bits:* The first 20 minutes were brilliant: the pace, the editing, the music, photography and dialogues...All the ingredients to prepare the audience for a good show.* Bale's portrayal of Batman is exemplary: dark, fast and furious.* Some of the action sequences were excellent including the Batcycle* And....That's it!Sure, Ledger's performance as a Joker was very good, not groundbreaking though. And yes, he certainly brought another dimension to the character. But he did not have the same impact or wicked humour (we are talking about a joker after all) as Nicholson's.For a film of this scale, there were too many 'dead time', i.e. scenes with loads of cheesy dialogues and no action. For a long movie like this one, one needs to keep the audience on the edge of their seat. Take last summer's Transformer, the film was too long for me but still kept a good pace of action sequences.The biggest problem with The Dark Knight was simple: too many characters and story lines. Sometime after the first 20 minutes, Nolan lost it: the movie was no longer about the capped crusader the film was named after but a whole series of people trying to distinguish good vs evil.The 90's Batman movies failed for the very reasons: loss of focus when there were too many characters involved.I reckon the film should have been called 'Harvey's lost it'.Do I regret watching it? No...So this film comes very neutral: some good scenes but not worthy of the praise it has received.For the record, Sam Raimy's first Spider-man remains for me the 'perfect' super-hero movie of recent time: simple, well-structured, with a comic book feel and a nice mix of dialogues and action sequences."
7253,True,"This was extremely entertaining all the way through, which is quite a statement for a film that is two-and-a-half hours long. There are absolutely no dry spots in this fascinating film. Does everything make sense? Of course not; there are a lot of holes in the story, but it's a superhero action film and it's not meant to be dissected for credibility. It's just supposed to entertain, and that it does.A large part of the credit for that goes to Heath Ledger for his ""The Joker"" portrayal. Every scene in which Ledger appeared was riveting. His speech, mannerisms and his dialog were fantastic. For the latter, I have to commend the screen writers who gave Ledger some great lines!Actually, he and Aaron Eckert, who played ""Harvey 'Two Face' Dent,"" were most of the show, character-wise. Maggie Gyllenhaal was good, too, as ""Rachel Dawes,"" the woman of both Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent's affections. Otherwise, the familiar good guys - Christopher Bale as ""Batman,"" Michael Caine as ""Alfred,"" Gary Oldman as Inspector/Commishoner Gordan"" and Morgan Freeman as ""Lucius Fox"" were okay but all more interesting in the previous film, ""Batman Begins."" Speaking of Fox, his high-and-mighty attitude toward Wayne's surveillance system was disappointing to hear. I had thought he had trust in Bruce Wayne. Also, I was sorry to hear the language deteriorate in the final half hour with some unneeded profanity by some inconsequential character.Overall, however, this latest Batman movie ranks among the best of any I've seen, at least on the first viewing. I'm looking forward to watching it again when the Blu-Ray disc comes out next month. This is a great film to enjoy visually and audibly with some fantastic action scenes and excellent dialog.I had heard that Batman was a ""dark"" and almost unlikable figure, himself, in this film but I did not find that. Hey, he did what he had to do to stop a maniacal killer (which ""Fox"" didn't understand., nor some of the other main characters.) For a guy who has provided nothing but good deeds for the fickle citizens of Gotham over the years, this hero certainly doesn't appear to be appreciated......except by his fans of comics and film.In fact, that's the only main thing I would dispute with the writers of this movie: their conclusion at the end that Batman is ""not a hero, but a dark knight."" No, I would say someone who continually risks his life to save others is quite a hero!"
7254,True,"The Dark KnightI know that everything that needs to be said about this movie has been said, but I write this after having viewed The Dark Knight for a third time. I truly believe this film to be one of best Blockbuster films to come out in some time; An elegant, intelligent film about the extremities of good and evil and most importantly, about faith that the better angels of our nature will prevail in mist of an unjust world. For that, the film ingrains the Batman mythology into our vision of American pop-culture, where archetypes Bruce Wayne/Batman, The Joker, and Harvey ""Two-Face"" Dent can be re-imagined for the perils and anxieties of our times. Wayne is portrayed as a man living in the skyline of his city, unaffected by the violence and mayhem that Gotham endures. His only newsworthy events are tabloid fodder, escaping in the ocean with a beautiful Russian dancer(of course all of these are alibis for his true motives). He is how we see the rich in this country, unattached but undeniably compelling and drawn to them. The Joker is re-identified as our worst fears, the random whims of destruction that can possess our lives in a deeper, morally unclear platform. He is a pure example of Terrorism, a man eager to play his chords while a city is engulfed in flames. Unlike some popular origins in which Joker is born from a fall into a batch of chemicals while encountering Batman (Alan Moore's The Killing Joke, for one), here he has no background, and appears as random as a Tornado in Kansas. He is similar to Anton Chigurh from No Country For Old Men, an uncompromising force that has a disturbing view of humanity without losing a peculiar charisma. Batman is the guard of Gotham's safety as well as a launching pad of criticism for the methods he employs to combat crime, including a sonar device that can detect the whereabouts of Gotham's citizens in order to stop The Joker. His actions are vaguely parallel to our government's war on terror, where our protection has severely compromised our personal liberty and begs to ask if the presence of a Big Brother, even for the sake of good, is a high price to pay.The structural lead character of this story, however, is Harvey Dent. A valiant, benevolent civil servant, Dent is a classical tragic hero that has his convictions turned against him, permanently transforming his face and his soul into a grotesque amalgam. His rise through the political ranks as a District Attorney resembles a youthful, energetic promise a fresh candidate with engrossing ideals brings, which perhaps resonates for us to the fascination we have for current Democratic nominee Barack Obama. But the ideals are irreparably tarnished when a personal tragedy destroys the will of this great man. As Two-Face, Dent's view of fairness relies on the flip of a coin, a final betrayal of the alliance between himself, Batman and Gordon. The sadness of Two-Face's rationale is that the world is indifferent and that random chance is the only balance of justice, where in fact the ability to change the world lies in the decisions we make. In that argument is where this movie transcends from a very good action thriller into one that reflects and questions our own morality and the role we play in society. Should we or shouldn't we be neutral in a moving train?"
7255,True,"I watched it yesterday. I came here to read user comments and I was :O, No 3 movie of all times?If it wasn't 3 hours LONG I would go and re-watch it just to see what did I miss that most of you loved so much. I honestly fail to see what all this hype-hysteria is about..First of all I think the film is way too long than it should be and got to be repetitive after one point. I mean how many times you need to see Joker doing the same things to understand that he is a very intelligent maniac/schizo/sociopath/whatever and can trick and manipulate everyone? Yes we got it, Joker is a schizophrenic genius or whatever, like Ledger's irritating acting wasn't enough. Oh yes, there are many horribly given Oscars out there you will soon can add one more for Heath for probably the worst performance of his career. If that wonderful and extremely talented actor was still alive he wouldn't even get an nomination. Except if you think that talking like crazy and overusing your tongue tick to show you are unstable is a first class acting. I thought Jack Nickolson typecasts but his Joker was a masterpiece comparing to Ledger's. Its really unfortunate that for this caricature acting he will be remembered and honored.The only performance worth of mentioning was Gary Oldman's. As for the rest of the movie, directing was first class, art direction not bad, cinematography was OK, the music was good, the script was.....What was the script about again? OK its a comic so that could justify the numerous plot holes (I can't even imagine how Joker with the help of mentally ill people can trap a whole city like this, not to mention the ridiculous two-face unreal makeup to name a few..). What else the script was about? That you can only beat chaotic terrorists by bending human rights (the mobiles sonar system) but its OK if you only do it once? hmmm dangerous! That good in people always beats evil? yeah! that! it 's like ethics for dummies...but maybe this is what young people need now-days, basic ethics and values teached by a rather boring Hollywood Movie. Which now makes me understand why it is rated so high.. doh.. hmmm dangerous.. learning values from Hollywood..."
7256,True,"Finally the new generation of Batman films has arrived and he is on the run. The film is long and there are many moments when no action happens, when the hero or the people are there to reflect upon events, to go down deep into themselves, to show us their feelings, their fears, their hopes. The film becomes a lot more psychological, mental even. It is talking of people, real people and how they react and live in a tense situation. The best moment of the film is when the people themselves have to decide who is going to die, them on one side or the others on the other side. They can do it on both sides and neither sides do it. They vote overwhelmingly for killing the others and yet they don't carry out their decision. Democracy is the worst imaginable regime because a majority is always found for the least ethical decisions that more or less demagogically please the masses, caress them in the right direction. And yet it remains the best because in these worst situations imaginable the people kind of react against the horror and the terror and do not follow the majority rule or reveal another layer of majority rule deeper and finer, well hidden but always ready to come out. The film shows how what is at stake is not what the masses are going to do in a crisis situation. It is what are the few individuals who have power and the means to use that power going to do, or rather become? And there the answer is super-negative. Individuals are always corrupted by the forces behind the terror that swoops down onto the masses. That's politics and that's well seen. And yet that's false when the film pretends these few corruptible people can be stopped. At least not the way the film says. They are never corrupted alone and they move into that corrupted state along with quite many people, armed forces, security forces and even more. The film is deeply reflecting on recent events but the diagnosis is wrong and the solution is wrong too. It will not be enough to get rid of the corrupted individual. It will not even be enough to get rid of him and the inner circle of his legion. You will have to explain why at a certain moment that man captured a vast majority of the people in elections or just public opinion. And you'll have to provide a way to reverse that fact and to prevent it from happening again. And then you will find you cannot prevent that because such massive support to evil when it is draped in a long shining armor of good is long lasting, very long lasting. The next solution is to turn that corrupted person into a dead hero. But then you have to turn your best friend into the fiend the masses require. Think of president Saakashvili in Georgia. He took the decision to send troops into Ossetia. That was a bad decision showing how he had been corrupted by his re-election and the anti-Russian feelings of some. You can even say he had been influenced if not directly manipulated by the Russians, or even by the West which more or less promised support, even military, another manipulation of course. His mind got corrupted and he provoked the big northern neighbor and he got what he deserved: his two military bases destroyed, the main airport destroyed, the main harbor destroyed, the basic infrastructures disrupted, the pipelines stopped. A military, economic, social and political catastrophe. Then what? Oust him and turn him into a hero? Follow the call of the hard liners among the people and start a guerrilla warfare adventure, provided the Russians decided to stay in Georgia? Send Bush to bury him deep and under a thick layer of concrete? Punish the Russians with isolation, as if they gave a damn about it because we, in the West, need their natural gas and their oil, not the reverse. This film is thus discussing this fundamental issue of what do we do with corrupted leaders who have commanded at some time in their careers vast support from the masses? The solution proposed is unrealistic. But the film is superb, especially because the Joker is really vicious and dangerous, really blood curdling and sickening, whereas with Jack Nicholson he was a funny clown. This time he is not a clown at all. And that is true: terrorism, even criminal terrorism and not political terrorism, is not funny, is not a game, is not a show. And it has means to get under the skin of most people. And then there is no solution, except an innocent fiend who will be on the run forever, like Ben Laden? We can wonder if our enemies, fiends are not such illusive evil beings who are not that evil but are necessary for the real evil ones to be kept in place. And are there even really alive, are they really real? Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"
7257,True,"a big Joke !First of all, can someone explain me why the camera is spinning like this all the time ? There is no reason to do that. Rollercoasters are fun but it never last 2 h 30. Christian Bale is not that good in this movie, and each times he uses his ""batman's voice"", it's impossible to take seriously. But why so serious ? Well...a little wouldn't hurt...and it'll never be as funny as the 1966 batman's version. The scarecrow part is not useful, so why bringing him back ? The part with the cell phone's sonar is lame, so lame you could cry... The end makes no point at all, and Bruce Wayne's sacrifice is just pointless. Well, maybe a tiny bit better than ""batman begins"", and the music is sometimes not annoying, these are the only good points. Ledger's interpretation is OK, but not well served by the rest, and the character of Twoface is too ""cartoonesque"". The balance is then pretty bad.I don't think there is any possibility in the near future to propose something comparable with ""Batman's return"", please stop trying !"
7258,True,"Amazing! Spectacular! IMDb no. 1! These words constitute only a part of most movie-related conversations over the past 3 weeks. The Dark Knight has beaten all expectations, broken all box-office records, earned critical acclaim and most importantly, has brought a huge smile to Batman fans everywhere. But, under all the hype, stripped off all the media attention and the huge spotlight placed on it by Heath Ledger's sad demise, how good IS The Dark Knight?The darkest version of Batman yet starts off with Joker robbing a bank. At the end of the scene, the Joker is probably established as THE person to watch through the movie. The 'new' Joker is definitely refreshing to see, as unlike past versions, Nolan's Joker doesn't play any campy, cheesy pranks. Neither does he waste his time with silly props. The Joker in The Dark Knight is as much a villain as Jack the Ripper was a serial killer. The story then slows down a bit, with action packed sequences popping in just at the right moments to make sure you don't get too lost just listening to the Mob drab on. Scarecrow is quickly (and quite rudely) pushed aside and within the hour, Harvey Dent is introduced as Rachel's new hubby (Beats Spideman 3 where Venom was introduced minutes before he died). Morgan Freeman gets a larger and much more prominent role as Lucius Fox and as is the case with Morgan Freeman, when he shoots a scene, the attention is going to be on him! That is, Lucius Fox ends up stealing Bruce Wayne's thunder quite a few times.The 'real' story starts when Joker decides to dedicate himself towards one mission - Batman's death. Like an alarm bell to wake those who managed to fall asleep during the slow bits, a corpse thuds onto the screen. Thus, begins the 'new' Joker's ""jokes"". Heath has brought a ""REAL"" element to the Joker that was missing in previous editions. Amazingly, Heath and Nolan have catapulted The Joker into Top 10 Villain lists while leaving The Joker as vague as possible. The various emotions he went through - smiling one second, anger the next, lust for pain and then expressionless - left most of the audience not knowing what to make of the Joker. The joker's mysteriousness, coupled with his insane (also meaning awesome) methods of 'serial-killing' left most of the audience on the edge of their seats. Oscar worthy? Win? Probably not, but a role that breathes life into a fading character should stand a good chance. Nomination? Definitely.However, for me, the real star of the movie was Aaron Eckhart. His portrayal of Harvey Dent was so real, picturing him as anything but a District Attorney seems almost impossible. He seemed to add something real to each scene he was in, whether he was battling Wayne, or supporting Batman, or just being your friendly neighbourhood DA, Harvey Dent seemed to be much more than a 'supporting' actor. However, his turn as Two Face towards the end of the movie slightly 'Dented' his performance. He seemed a little 'awkward' as Two Face, unsure whether to play him full of emotion or leave him as a stoic character. The coin toss though added yet another element to an already wonderful film.The rest of the cast - Bale played a good Batman, but was clearly outshone by his supporting cast (Dent & Joker). Rachel Dawes - Oh my God! Her topsy-turvy love life left possibly the only blemish on an otherwise perfect film. Excellent acting, horrible storyline for poor Rachel. Lucius Fox - Would definitely prefer him in a smaller role, as he kinds of takes 'away' spotlight from the others, even when he doesn't need it. Michael Caine played an impeccable Alfred! The Mob also played their roles well with the exception of a few and didn't take anything away from the film.Nolan's genius, last but definitely not least, has to be appreciated most of all. To take a movie franchise that had been beaten into oblivion by probably the most awfully made movie (Batman & Robin), with horrible direction and even worse costumes, Nolan has managed to turn Batman back into a real 'superhero'. Starting with Batman Begins, Nolan has perfected every scene till it couldn't be perfected anymore. And the absence of CGI, not only provides a 'real' look to the film, but makes it tons more amazing.So for me the cast would be rated: Nolan (Director)>Dent>Joker>Batman/Bruce Wayne>Alfred>Fox>DawesLastly, lots of people believe undue credit may have gone Batman's way thanks to Ledger's death. Sure, it may have exaggerated some views, but The Dark Knight altogether is really not that bad a movie at all. Really, not bad at all! All in all, an amazing film, definitely one of the top 20 I have ever seen and possibly the only one to leave ALL the characters engraved in the viewer's mind. Kudos to Nolan and crew!"
7259,True,"The Dark Knight blew me away in seconds.The Joker's Entrance was amazing and so shocking.Then his meeting with the Mafia was classic.The characters were great.Harvey Dent was a very good character and was slowly turning to the dark side like Anakin in Star Wars.It was a very long movie.The story was amazing and the effects were outstanding.Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was amazing,Brilliant...just classic.Shame the actor's death will mean we will never see the Joker again.Above all The Dark Knight was a memorable film which i will never get tired of.Hope a 3rd one is in the works.There were also a lot of surprises in the film.I won't mention but there was one that shone out above the lot.The Story is basically Batman(Christian Bale) And The Gotham Police starting to clean up Gotham's crime when a new villain the Joker(Heath Ledger)Enters Gotham hoping to create havoc and mayhem across Gotham.Bruce/Batman also has to adjust to the love of her Life Rachel(Maggie Gyllenhall) Dating Lawer Harvey Dent(Aaron Eckhart).Batman allies with Harvey and James Gordan(Gary Oldman) to bring down the Joker and the MOB once and for all...but will suffer heavy consequences along the way which will affect and destroy Batman forever."
7260,True,"First of all, I am a big admirer of NOLAN brothers since MEMENTO and I was expecting this sequel to be good. But, its beyond my expectation. All ingredients, directing, casting, screenplay, cinematography, etc... Everything is in place. You don't see the BATMAN as a cartoon character but an eccentric business man with lots of sources,strong willed,intelligent, in great physical shape, but not a super human being... Even the other characters, Joker, Harvey Dent(Two face). I can not stop and add this mentioning his name;amazing JOKER performance by Heath Ledger. Can't be described by words, you need to see it. All the actors were great; Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Cain, Gary Oldman but I need to say this even though I love her as an actress, Maggie Gyllenhaal wasn't not in the character. Thats the only criticism, I can do about the movie. From the fist moment, you feel like you live in GOTHAM CITY. It comes from great directing skills of Christopher Nolan. Camera moves, details of surroundings, they are just amazing. Two thumbs up for Jonathan Nolan for making the very well-known story in to something else. So, don't say it is a BATMAN sequel, go and see this great movie. It will worth it."
7261,True,"I thought this movie was extremely well done. Heath Ledger was astounding as the Joker. One of the Best Batman films so far. It was smart to include Two-Face to the plot. The fact that the White Knight of Gothem turned against good after his love died was genius on behalf of the Joker. I also thought that Micheal Caine and Morgan Freeman were very good in the movie too. I also really liked the Joker's stories of how he got his scars and found them very chilling and the way the Joker licked his lips in a very intense way was amazingly done by Heath Ledger (R.I.P). I thought the conclusion statement made by Gordon (Gary Oldman) was the perfect way to end the film. In a nutshell I thought this movie was well done, intense and extremely enjoyable. Great movie over all. Enjoyed thoroughly! On the edge of my seat the entire time."
7262,True,"A daring bank heist kicks open the second Batman film directed by Christopher Nolan. Continuing on the path provided in the Batman Begins, The Dark Knight balances itself between reality and comic book fantasy. The action certainly is from the comics in the way of realism, but the style is nothing but gritty realism, but even that it seems to do in steroids, which is not a bad thing.As some other reviewers have stated, this movie is not about the Batman (Christian Bale), but the Joker (Heath Ledger), who is not given a similar birth story like he was in Tim Burton's Batman film, but who just enters the room, so to speak, and is utterly insane and fascinating in his own deadly way. In fact I was mesmerized how little Ledger resembled anything I'd seen him before this. I wasn't looking at an actor, I was looking at the Joker, ripped from the pages of the comic books and thrown on the screen in his full insanity intact.The second criminal in the tale is Twoface, aka Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who's a district attorney of Gotham city, who has a transformation of his own in the tale, all thanks to Joker's twisted little games.The Dark Knight is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. The story twists and turns in every way, but it manages to keep in tact better than some films with simpler lines. Well chosen actors mixed with good score, well woven plot, stunning cinematography and breath taking action makes The Dark Knight one of the best films to come out in ages."
7263,True,"I liked the previous movie, but this one blew me away. It actually strives to be far more clever than you'll see coming. It must take a lot of guts and balls to push ahead for some of the things they got away with. So props to Nolan for sticking to his guns and producing a movie that feels twice as much like one of his films than the last one did. I imagine it has to do with finishing the set up stuff and being established enough to trust his own vision more freely perhaps. The result is something far more interesting and much more adult.What needs to be said about the rock solid backbone provided by the legends of Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman. Freeman can do those kind of parts in his sleep and yet he still brings an added twinkle in his eye, which suggests a lot in small amount of time. I've always enjoyed Michael Caine and always adored his dynamic with Bruce and how he brings him back down to earth. Gary Oldman embodies Jim Gordon so well, finally we see his evolution to Commissioner. From being baffled by his 'death' to being touched by the contrast of gentle family man and desperate hardened last of honest cops. He has a wonderful acting three way dance with Bale and Eckhart. He knows his role and how to serve it so well. He proves again why he's the chameleon of chameleons.Maggie Gyllenhaal comes off more convincing than Katie Holmes, at the same time, the character is still the weak link. I get that shes tough but thats all I get about her character. So Alas her fate failed to get the desired emotion from me but it actually didn't seem to matter that much, as the pace didn't slow down enough for it too sink in and was too other wise exciting.Christian Bale certainly brings the special brand of intensity to the table. Bale makes him so much more human but also isn't afraid to remind us of his unlikeable qualities too. Or too allow us to see just how freakishly unstable he looks when he's pounding criminals. His shining moment is probably his being perfectly happy to cripple in lieu of killing. You do see the ghost of the wounded boy he once was in rare moments of nice subtle quite acting. However he's not without flaws either. The prime one being that darn Batman voice he puts on, it's really cheesy and hard to keep taking seriously, especially when he insists on using it privately with people in the know.The New boy Aaron Eckhart does an extremely admirable effort in a considerably layered turn as Harvey Dent. I needed to care about him and that I was able to do individually speaking. The makeup was fittingly gruesome and the transformation was careful enough. They didn't even really overdo the coin routine. I liked that he didn't compete with Joker, it was a good contrast. Two-Face is ruthless no nonsense stone cold aggression personified. It does get very intense the way he goes after Gordon's family and it's genuinely shocking how he becomes the catalyst for the ending's change of direction for the series.Yes I've saved the best for last. The now late great Heath Ledger completely washed away any doubts I had, almost from the moment we see him in full stride. As a die-hard Joker fan, I must thank him for such a parting gift for cinema goers. I honestly can't remember the last time I've been so entertained by a single performance. He was literally everything he needed to be. Loved the crowish makeup and the idea that he carved the permanent grin onto his face. I especially liked that in such a serious love to hate performance, he still never entirely lost that sense of black charisma, he is after all in addition to whatever else he is, a black hearted entertainer in his own mind. The blowing up the hospital part was a prime example of just enough underlining humour for the audience. But best of all had to be all the little touches from the comics. The nod to Alan Moore's Killing Joke, the being an compulsive lier, how he changes his story of how he got his scars for each different victim. And yet whatever did really happen, thanks to Ledger's gritty acting, you really feel he's reliving something horrible in those moments. There you see the pathetic shell of a human being behind the Greece paint, the man who loathes the rest of the world for being emotionally stronger than he is, refusing to take the easy way out or to get the joke as he sees it. The ultimate twist on the tears of a clown. It basically shows in spades how much it must have took that uniquely dedicated an actor, willing to go to such extremes to dig up such a real performance. I have to agree with those who hail it among the rare special performances that don't roll round often. It must be said that he is indeed well matched by very accommodating writing. The use of school buses and mental patients who can't know any better really visualise the depth of his evil. Finally the sweetest touch was probably the sheer lenghs they went to in order to show us his intelligence rather than giving endless lip service to it. The opening with the build up's elaborate domino effect of double crosses tells you everything before you even see his face and is perhaps one of the best openings of movies in general.A hell of a movie, it's told the rest of the summer offerings a big ol' ""beat that!"" So get yourselves back to those cinemas folks, you haven't a moment to loose, to your peoplemobiles away!"
7264,True,"This is a fantastic comic book/superhero movie  easily my favorite. The actors are very good, especially some of the minor roles. The action, gadgets  every staple of Batman Begins  is there in full force and better looking than ever. The movie is gorgeous.The real highlight of this movie is Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker. Some might be under the impression that all the talk and hype about his performance leading up to the theatrical release was because of his unfortunate early death. That impression, however, is definitely not accurate. Ledger's Joker is everything that was hyped and promised and then some. It is simply spectacular.Thanks in a large part to Ledger, Dark Knight is surprisingly emotional. There are parts that are (unsurprisingly) dark. But the mannerisms of the Joker and what he thinks and what he says are extremely funny. He has the ability to instantly change the tone of a scene  something that Nolan used to great effect.My only real (but small) complaint is that there are a few problems with the otherwise strong story. Dark Knight's plot does not seem as controlled as Batman Begins  the pacing of some sections is a little off. Also, Joker was an agent of chaos, destroying other's plans because he hates control, yet his actions were superbly planned  ""it's all part of the plan."" This criticism may be superficial, but there's no need to get into the deeper philosophy of the movie here other than to say it is engaging and fun.In short, if you love good action with a good story with great acting, this is definitely a must see. Ledger's performance is fantastic  in my opinion, it deserves piles of awards.10/10"
7265,True,I've never been into Superheroes or comics but since this movie got praised to the heavens I watched it. And it blew. The story is simply the joker trying to spread chaos over Gotham City (obviously Chicago) because he is mad (there is also the Mafia and stuff but I found myself not caring at all in a matter of minutes so i will leave it out of this review). Batman tries to stop him being supported by Harvey Dent and Comissioner Gordon (in the beginning Lieutenant Gordon). I will now list the pros and cons: Pro: - Batman looks cool in his costume - The Gotham City Impositors are in the movie - The Joker is well actedCons: - Batmans annoying voice Illogical things like the scene with the two ferries and the bomb. One side would surely have blown up the other because they didn't know if Batman could save them. Or the scene were Joker falls from a building and Batman saves him. Why? He could have just walked away instead of saving this mentally insane guy who just tried to spread chaos all over the city. - The Police in this movie. They are just stupid and incapable of doing their job right. They had several chances to shoot the Joker. For example the oh so beloved chase scene where the joker fires rockets at them. He is in plain view about 10 meters away and the S.W.A.T. guys don't even consider opening the door and shooting him. Or the scene where the old Comissioner is killed. If someone is a possible target for an assassination the police should check every corner of all his casual whereabouts Dent is convinced to be evil and mad in a matter of seconds Batman gets not enough screen time. They could have just named it Joker and Harvey Dent and some others but barely Batman: the Movie - The moral at the end is just naive. Everybody would choose to blow up someone else in order to survive. It isn't ethical at all to choose that you rather like to be blown up it's just pathetic. Because if both sides choose to not blow the other side up they both die. - The characters are bland and barely likable. Batman gets to little screen time to build up a real personality. The Joker is just the Joker but in this film without any real goal but to destroy anything. And the others are just bland.As you can clearly see I personally don't like this movie and I think it totally not deserves to be Nr.7 in the list of the greatest movies of all time.
7266,True,"A few arguments to show how mediocre this movie really is: two ships, having the choice of killing each other, or being killed. If every ship will be blown up at midnight anyway, what kind of choice is that? It is certain death, so pushing the button seems the only choice you have. The only way to survive is to push. It is no real dilemma. The weakest Batman in history. Being saved several times by humble earthlings. Carrying a suit that is not up for dog bites but yes for bullets? Further: the least interesting. Where is the psychology?Morgan Freeman's character: the whole city is burning, hospitals are exploding, people on ferries about to kill each other, and he's making a point of privacy? How can a joker have no sense of humor? Scary at times, he is as flat as a penny. A bit of humor, the dark one that is, would have made him really dangerous. Now he is but a nut. The whole point of a joker is that he is bad as hell, but charming too. He makes you fall in love with evil. Ledger did excellent with how little he was given.Harvey Dent: turns into a revengeful monster in seconds? Psychologically so empty: first all he wants is good, then all he wants is revenge. 'They took her away from me'. Such a stereotype.Chris Nolan seems to be: humorless, wanting to distract the viewer from a hollow story by means of flashes and effects."
7267,True,"Amidst the clamor there might always be a dissenting voice with a different perspective and one who climbed up to the top of the high risers to view this production perhaps a few dozen yards above the gargoyle-like, statuesque Caped Crusader.Here, banter about the nature of a criminal mind and sweeping sky flights and explosions replace story values and depth. Continuity is sacrificed for action. An over the top performance wild enough to be suspected for dope fueling by a now beloved, dead actor keynotes the scenario and etches deep into the psyche deep enough to be indelible and appears to bring glory to what is really an overblown, contrived production.Extreme cruelty and sadistic enterprise replace plot and hammer away the chain of promises of the story. Where in Batman Begins we had a fascinating account and worthy characterizations we now have unsupported, unfounded surprises with gaps in character development. The personality dysfunction is so extreme as to press painfully against the science of psychology and the logic of common sense.What is it that drives the audiences and critics so wild about this production where the budget soared to almost $200 million? In the annals of film history we were uplifted by life affirming values, the motives of true heroes and were rewarded by story somehow easing a small aspect of our tedious, sometimes painful, boring lives. Instead we now are treated to the Circus Maximus, the Flavian Amphitheater, blood, gore, and easy, cheap death. The film theater critics rave and drool. Bob Kane simply turns, uncomfortably in his grave."
7268,True,"OK, don't know where to begin. There's just too many things wrong with this Dark Knight. 1st of all why does this movie have such high ratings? Because Heath Ledger died? Because if you actually watch the movie, there's no reason for these high ratings. The Tim Burton Versions of Batman in the 90s were a lot better than this Hollywood plastic. Some random Batman actions scenes a sloppy played Joker that has nothing to offer than just to blow up police stations and hospitals (Wow....hes such a clever joker, he can blow up things). I mean come on!! Which part about this movie is good? The atmosphere is not there ---- only 2 dimensions. Christopher Nolan is doing his ""magic"" to make you sleepy, because thats his magic gift to the world. He can make me sleepy with movies like no other director. But I guess I'm too old for this hype and only young people with really low IQs can enjoy this pile of rubbish. I can only connect these 2 dots --- 1. Low IQ + 2. likes explosions = 9.0 rating on IMDb......wait and Heath Ledger died right? Yeah so IMDb top ten movie right? Exactly."
7269,True,"I don't know if this is the most overrated film ever, but it's the worst one I've seen in a long, long time. Almost as long as this steaming waste of three hours of my life. Let's review: * Suspension of disbelief is part and parcel of the superhero world, but c'mon. You're telling me this psychopath has recruited dozens of henchman, purchased mountains of equipment and rigged several hundred barrels of explosives in locations all over the city, and the world's greatest detective can't find a SINGLE BLEEDING CLUE without some Mr. Wizard cell phone stunt? Yeah, sure, half the cops are on the take, but are all of them blind, in this post-9/11 world? The Joker's band is comprised of escapees from an asylum, but they're all lean, mean, disciplined and competent? * This may be the widest ratio of screen time:plotfree of the decade. Too many characters. Too many side scenes. Too many random encounters. Too much exposition that doesn't actually expose anything. What do we leave this movie knowing? Anything? * The sheer quality was poor. Much of the film was too dark to see, and the sound was terribly spotty, yoyoing between blaringly loud and inaudible.* Yeah, Ledger did a good job, so stipulated. He still wouldn't have cadged an Oscar for it without the posthumous sympathy vote.* Finally ... this just blew a hole through the genre. Aren't the good guys supposed to WIN? They spend the movie losing ... dozens of people getting murdered, hundreds wounded and terrorized, chaos, mayhem, death and destruction and violence, and they pretty much lose at the end too. There's very little hopeful or uplifting here.2/10, barely."
7270,True,"I thought ""Batman Begins"" was the best Batman movie of them all when I saw it and I still think that. It was the first Batman movie to fully explore how Bruce Wayne became Batman by showing his training by a mentor (Liam Neeson) and it made you fully appreciate what he was trying to achieve by turning fear back on the evil-doers. Even without the big Batman villains of The Joker, The Penguin and Catwoman, the makers of ""Batman Begins"" managed to do something new and different with an old character. It ended with a reference to the arrival of The Joker in Gotham City and it set the pulses racing with anticipation.Heath Ledger's casting as The Joker did raise some eyebrows, he wasn't an obvious choice and hadn't previously shown any of the manic energy necessary to play the Clown Prince of Gotham. While the calls (or demands more like) for an Oscar for Heath Ledger for his performance here are stretching things, he does bring an interesting energy to the performance. Jack Nicholson really nailed the character of The Joker, so it was going to be hard for anyone to live up to that. I guess Ledger did as good as anyone could have expected.The action scenes in ""The Dark Knight"" are spectacular and they are the best thing about the film. The real problem is the script. Christopher Nolan brought his brother on board as screenwriter, he hadn't been involved in the first film and it shows. The script is too long, we could have easily done without Harvey Dent/Two-Face in it (although the make-up effects on this character are excellent). If you cut his character out, you'd have a much more streamlined movie.Heath Ledger was never a comic actor and Christopher Nolan's movies aren't known for their humour either and that's another problem here. The Joker's funniest scenes are in the hospital when he goes to visit Harvey Dent. Dressed up as a nurse with a red wig, the only dialogue the writers can think of for The Joker to say is: ""Hi."" (Couldn't they have thought of something funnier than that?) Then, when the Joker blows up the hospital by remote control detonation, you keep waiting for the funny lines to come, but they never do. There are constant silences where there should be one-liners. Jack Nicholson had some tremendous quips as The Joker in Tim Burton's ""Batman,"" Heath Ledger never really gets the same service from the screenwriters. That's a pity.After 9/11, many new security measures were brought in and some of them lead to protests about invasion of people's privacy. There is a scene is this movie that mirrors that when Batman uses the cellular phones of the people of Gotham to track The Joker through sonar (it's also the visual equivalent of the hallucogenic scenes at the end of ""Batman Begins""). Morgan Freeman's character, Lucius Fox, proffers his resignation rather than ""spy on 30 million people."" It's a clever scene and it elevates The Joker's attacks on Gotham into a context we can all relate to, unfortunately it's only a brief moment in a very long movie and the rest of the film isn't as clever.Christian Bale seems to be growling his lines even more as Batman here than he did in the first film and it does get a little irritating at times. He's also not as buffed up as he was in the first one. The character development of Bruce Wayne that was so interesting in the first one grinds to a halt in this film. We find out precious little about him here, that goes for The Joker too and I feel the film suffers as result.Michael Caine returns as Alfred, but he doesn't have much to do this time around. The same goes for Morgan Freeman. The cast doesn't feel as special this time even though it's the same people all over again.Overall, this doesn't have the tight structure of ""Batman Begins"", it feels bloated and could have been fixed. It's just one robbery, kidnapping or car chase after another and it does start to get repetitive after a while. I hope the next Batman sequel is more in line with ""Batman Begins"" than this one."
7271,True,"At most this movie is only popular for 2 reasons: its Batman, and Heath Ledger died after the making of this film which in turn made it a pity movie much like 'Queen of the Damned' did for Aliyah. At first I believe this movie was taking a very exciting and enriching role in the modern and 'realistic' feel most of the new super hero movies are trying to do. But somehow, they tried too hard.We all know that Heath Ledger died. He died of an overdose at a famous twins' place. Does that mean I have to like a bad movie just because he plays the joker? He really did do a great job but the script it self and the drawn out plot just kills the move. I honestly thought it ended 3-4 times around the hour and a half marker. Too much for one movie makes it a bad movie. Try making 2-face the next villain in the NEXT movie.Most say this was the best movie ever. If it was so great then tell me why without saying anything about Heath Ledger and his great performance that everyone already knows. Without mentioning that this is indeed a Batman movie remake made to look real and modern. Nothing about the length or the script or even how it drags on and on? Good movie. Only if you watch the first hour and half."
7272,True,"Christopher Nolan returns with The Dark Knight, his second entry in the post millennial Batman franchise. Christian Bale returns as a more anguished, morally ambiguous Batman than before. Morgan Freeman returns as Luscious Fox, Gary Oldman returns as Gordon, and Michael Caine once again is Alfred. All actors shine in their supportive roles, especially Oldman. Maggie Gyllenhaal is the new Rachel Dawes and is OK in the role but nothing more. Aaron Eckhart plays Harvey Dent/Two-face in a great visual parallel to the film's theme of moral ambiguity and the duality of man. Heath Ledger as the psychotic joker becomes the catalyst forcing each of the righteous men to act for good or ill: Batman, Harvey Dent, and Gordon. Ledger's performance is as good as advertised. The action, acting, art and set direction, cinematography, dialog, and direction are all first rate. The film builds to a different kind of climax, reminding us that fate plays a role in influencing our lives, and we must adjust to survive. This is a terrific action film for adults with several contemporary parallels that are a little uncomfortable at times. There are a few drawbacks, such as how the joker seems to pull everything off without a hitch off camera. The Bond-like moments and the obnoxious flip comments made by Nicky Katt in the S.W.A.T. van during the chase under the Chicago loop are serious detractors from an otherwise outstanding super hero movie. The brief appearance by scarecrow served what purpose? This appears in IMDb's top 5 of all time? I think that says more about today's audiences and less about the film. ***1/2 of 4 stars."
7273,True,"I have to say the hype about this movie was much bigger than it should have been. I found it quite confusing that the story was quite hard to follow and the cutting was not good at all in my opinion.Christian Bale didn't deliver again, for me he doesn't seem like a good actor at all, you can actually see that he's just trying to act in most of his scenes, nothing original there, he's just saying the lines he has to say. Almost no emotions at all. And it was quite funny how drastically his voice changed when dressed as Batman, it was ridiculous.The only thing (the only person) who saved this movie in my opinion was Heath Ledger, his performance was quite good, he was intense, you really felt entertained when he stepped on the scene. Watching him play as the Joker was the only good part of this movie in my opinion. he actually sort of waked me up when he appeared, those where the only parts of the movie when everybody was strictly paying attention to what was happening.And I don't really know why didn't they stick with Katie Holmes as Rachel, Maggie Gyllenhaal to me wasn't pretty at all, and she's not as good as Katie anyway... That was so disappointing for me.To sum up things, there were couple of good scenes in the movie, but it was too long. And if you feel like the movie is too long, that means the viewer loses interest in the story while watching, well that's what happened to most of the viewers in the cinema as far as I saw it. The flow of the movie was also not really good, it was hard to stay focused what was exactly happening in some scenes and why was it happening that way.Even Batman Begins was better than this movie..."
7274,True,"It is a good movie. It is not a great movie. After all of the hype I was a bit disappointed. I enjoyed the movie but thought it was just a run of the mill superhero action flick. The performances were good. All of the actors were believable and Heath Ledger's Joker was a great character but it was a one note performance. There was no real depth to the character for me. Each time he appeared he acted in the same psychotic manner but there wasn't an exploration as to why he was doing what he was doing or where he planned to take the story. The story was just a simplistic hatred of Batman and a want to unmask him. Sorry, same old, same old. Superhero movies suffer from clichéd story lines. Superman in each movie will be exposed to kryptonite. Profess his unfulfilled love for Lois Lane, (why I don't know. She is usually portrayed as some skinny, ambitious harpy), and is eventually saved from the bad guy by some babe. Spiderman yearns with unfulfilled love for his girlfriend and fights off some bad guy while reminiscing again about his Uncle, who we get to see die again. Batman will struggle with his demons while fighting off another bad guy punctuated by corrupt cops and double crosses. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a fine actress and is attractive but she is not an outstanding beauty who would attract the Joker to her in lieu of all of the other babes in the room. It is not helpful when the script has to tell you that the character is beautiful. The character's looks should tell you she is beautiful. Monique Curnen was there to provide the corrupt cop. One of many. She was wasted. Give me something new and fresh. Not a new gadget but a new story line. Explore more than the obvious. This movie was a series of vignettes of action scenes and simplistic twists. There were way too many deus ex machina moments and the twists did nothing but provide excuses for more action scenes. SPOILER ALERT. The scene with the cop being goaded by the joker to beat him up was clumsily telegraphed. Gordan appearing again at the exact opportune moment rang false. Aaron Eckhart's accident and metamorphosis into Two-face was rushed and hardly used. It became more of a distraction from the main story of the Joker. The Joker's character could have been examined in more depth. As it was the ending felt like it was there only to provide grist for the sequel. Heath Ledger's unfortunate death, which added hype to the movie, also destroyed the ending of the movie. There was no closure. It seems more like coming attractions for the next movie. Don't get me wrong it was a fun movie but it is just a summer popcorn movie and not a wondrous masterpiece it is being touted as. See it, enjoy it and then forget it until the next installment."
7275,True,"I really can't understand why people are gushing about this. The movie was overcomplicated, overly-long and, frankly, quite boring.The set-pieces were a mixed bag, i'll admit, ranging from the ludicrous Hong Kong escape (where the plane managed to out-fox the entire Hong Kong airforce) to be glorious (the truck trip). However, I had serious issue with the fight sequences. Almost every combat sequence (Batman Vs The Bad Guys) was overly-jumpy, with hardly any clear view of what was going on.The Scarecrow appearance was a bad joke. Two minutes of screen time and no follow-on? I was fully expecting him to turn up later. This was a criminal waste of an opportunity as The Scarecrow really has the ability to throw an extra level of chaos into a situation.Two-Face 'turned' in the last 15 minutes, when I was already glancing at the cinema ceiling wondering when it was going to end. However, I will say that this character (Harvey Dent) was the most interesting of the entire movie. Without doubt.The Joker was not the central character to the movie, as you would believe based on the hype. That honor, IMO, went to Harvey Dent. However, The Joker was played in a suitably crazy, off-the-wall, manner.Batmans throaty voice was verging on the ridiculous, especially in overly-long scenes of dialoge, as they were towards the end. In Batman Begins his voice was relatively controlled but raised and deepened when he got angry (and amplified with The Scarecrow). In this, it was a constant, irritating growl/scratchy throat noise, even when he was speaking to Rachel, who knew his real identity! How on earth they didn't catch this in pre-screenings and complain, I don't know.The plot just seemed to go around and around and around, with no discernible start, middle and end and a palpable lack of believability. How did The Joker manage to infiltrate a troop of Police without anyone noticing the massive scars on his face? How come the blades on Batmans arm-guards stuck an inch into the wood, at the start of the movie, but seemed to glance off The Jokers face at the end (leaving no scars)? How come a simple bike crash left Batman knocked clean out yet in every other scene where he takes a hammering, he's fine and can pick himself up? For a movie that claims to bring the franchise back down to earth it certainly managed to bypass many problems for the sake of the plot.The editing was also poor, with completely unconnected scenes cutting into each other in a rather obvious, jarring, manner. I noticed this within the first 10 minutes.Ultimately, I think the crux of the problem was that where Batman Begins was a focused, tight, plot consisting of a relatively small, core, set of characters, this tried to expand in all areas but didn't retain the same level of pace which left it trying to cover many more angles without the same level of detail. Any film that has me concentrating more on how my backside is aching or what the cinema ceiling looks like, proves only that its not been able to deliver enough to keep my attention focused. Where movies like Ironman and The Incredible Hulk did just that, this didn't come close."
7276,True,"After re-watching Batman Begins only recently, I was very excited about seeing The Dark Knight. Unfortunately, the sequel was nowhere near as good as the last film. Cillian Murphy, who was excellent as the Scarecrow in the first movie appeared on screen for about two minutes and was then written off - which begs the question ""why include him in the sequel in the first place?!"". Pretty much the same goes for Two-Face. There was a lot of potential for developing this character and it all started off quite well but once he actually turned into Two-Face, he got the chance to be the baddie for about 10 minutes before getting killed off. Heath Ledger was okay as the Joker, even though I personally thought he over-acted the role at times. Admittedly, there were some good action sequences and special effects but on the whole the story lacked consistency and did not really seem to go anywhere. A good example for this is the bit in Hong Kong which seems to have been put in to give Lucius Fox a bit more screen time. In my opinion there was too much focus on cramming in as many characters as possible rather than on developing a convincing storyline."
7277,True,"TDK is a long and tedious with themes common in superhero action movies. Some examples: 1. The hero who's not sure he wants to be one: Same as Spiderman 2, Superman 2, X-men, and even the previous Batman 2 movie.2. The hero who must chose between the woman he loves and his duty to be a hero: again, the Superman movies, Spiderman movies, etc, etc.3. The theme where the characters have to make a choice between two unappealing options: Every SAW movie.4. And of course, the hero as martyr. ""Why is he running Daddy, he didn't do anything wrong?"" ""He has to son. He's the hero we need but not the hero we want."" Oh for the love of....blah blah blah. This was the entire theme of Spiderman 2.Waste of time and over rated. Come on folks. Let's demand a little more originality in our movies!"
7278,True,"Let me first say that I myself am surprised for only giving it 4 stars. When I first saw this film, and first reviewed it I had given it 10 shiny stars...However upon my second viewing of it, something turned me completely off to it.Now, in all honesty this movie for me could be looked upon like a very expensive sushi dinner: Everything is beautiful: All the players involved were amazing. The scenery was incredible, the dialogue (with the minor exception of Christian Bales' 9000 cigarette a day Batman voice) we not over the top in any way. The story line was well thought out, and well played.I mean from that standpoint you really can't say anything bad.It had substance, and wasn't just all fluff. It really was a 10 star film! So why do I only give it 4 stars? Well, like any high class restaurant, appearance and presentation, and quality of the food is simply the the beginning. And this film had it all, really it did.However, it lacked one thing for me, and that is...Taste...It simply left a bad flavor in my mouth and it took me the better part of a day to figure out why.With a film that is so incredible on every level, it did exactly what so many films before it has done, and failed miserably at every single time.Trying to fit in too much.The ""more bang for your buck"" mentality.I was simply enjoying Heath Ledgers performance, and honestly did not seem him on the screen anywhere. He was Joker all the way. Sinister, psychotic, mad. Simply amazing.But where it killed it for me was with Harvey Dent and Two-Face. Yes he acted it well, yes the makeup artists were phenomenal. I mean everything about him was good.Except that all of his character should have been saved for Batman 3! Partway through the movie, it almost seemed that The Dark Knight could have ended, and another film began.It wasn't one particular point per say, but more of an overlapping of ideas. Here we are following the Joker, and then the Joker's story starts to overlap with Harvey Dents story.Like Venom in Spider-Man 3, Harvey Dent while integral to the story became an after thought.A very strong after thought mind you, but an after thought none the less.They could have done so much more with his character and the end result of The Dark Knight could have very easily been incorporated more into a third film.But instead they chose to cram as much as they could into one film, and there you have it.Had I done it, I would have had the transformation of Dent as the cliffhanger to the Dark Knight, and made an entirely different story line based more on Dent/Two-Face in a 3rd film.It is this reason that the film left a bad taste in my mouth.Petty? Over reacting? Nit Picking? Maybe so, maybe not. However, as most avid film viewers know it usually only takes one thing to screw up a great film, and for me, this was it."
7279,True,"First of all, what a wonderful performance from Heath Ledger. He immersed himself totally in the role as the Joker, a much more sinister and psychotic portrayal than Jack Nicholson's 1989 performance which was also excellent. Was his performance alone good enough to propel this film to number one on the IMDb website? Absolutely not!! Do not believe the hype!! Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman are veterans of the screen and are very easy to watch. Christian Bale as Batman was quite ordinary this time around and I imagine his throat was very sore by the end of production with all the growling he did. The character development of Batman as a person was well thought out in Batman Begins. We saw him face his fears and conquer them, something very much at the heart of authentic Martial Arts training and provided an insight into the character we as the audience could relate to. In the Dark Knight, he appears too one dimensional. His guilt at the death of innocent lives by the Joker is for the most part portrayed by bland expressions and plenty of growling when disguised as Batman. Maggie Gyllenhaal was just plain bland as Rachel Dawes. There didn't seem to be much chemistry between herself and Christian Bale in the one romantic scene they had together. I thought there was more chemistry with Katie Holmes and Christian in Batman Begins. I found myself nodding off when she had screen time with Aaron Eckhart. Thankfully, the director must have reviewed her lack luster performance up to this point and decided the only option left was to blow her up. Aaron Eckhart's performance as Harvey Dent was for the most part quite bland also, but improved somewhat after becoming Two Face. His scene in the hospital with Heath Ledger was his one saving grace. The hand to hand combat was quite ordinary in TDK. With Batman being a practitioner of Ninjutsu , there was no dynamic display of technique to marvel at, or the subtleties of subterfuge (psychological) like in Batman Begins for which this art is known to employ. The film dragged at the end and needed to finish half an hour earlier. Overall, Heath carries the film with his performance, but there was a lot in the film that felt disjointed and not up to par with the original."
7280,True,"The Dark Knight was a very good follow up to Christopher Nolan's first batman film Batman begins. I watched this last night and enjoyed it pretty much but it didn't really blew me away as compared to Tim Burton's version of Batman. I enjoyed it particularly because of the acting, music, atmosphere which were phenomenal. I gave it 8 stars because I wasn't really into this whole ""dark"" batman thing and Jack Nicholsan as Joker was deeply etched in my memory ever since I watched it when I was only 6. The movie started of with a bang with Joker(Heath Ledger) as he robs a bank and killing his accomplices one by one so which led him to leaving with the entire amount of money robbed that day. Joker wasn't actually in need of the money, he was robbing mainly for the thrill of it as could be seen later in the movie when he burns down a mountain of cash. Heath ledger did an amazing job as acting the downright evil, corrupt, insane, psychotic nemesis of batman as he goes all out his way against what batman upholds: justice, even to the point where he made Harvey Dent aka half-face( Aaron Eckhart) a villain to Gotham city who was previously deemed as ""white knight"" of Gotham. Comparing it to Jack Nicholsan's rendition of Joker, Heath Ledger's version of Joker was more scary, evil and less funny which was similar to the later versions of the comic book.Besides Heath Ledger, the rest of the cast were excellent. Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our Caped Crusader as he struggles between his 2 personalities of being a rich heir and an upholder of justice which also puts his relationship with Rachel Dawes on the rocks.Aaron Eckhart also did an amazing job as ""white knight."" His sense of justice was also what brought him and Rachel Dawes(Maggie Gyllenhaal) together. However, the loss of his love and with Joker's mind-playing, he was drove to insanity and became the villain that he would have previously hated. Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent's as he struggles with emotions, justice and insanity brought Half-face to another level.Maggie Gyllenhaal did great replacement for Katie Holmes as Wayne's love interest Rachel Dawes, as she shows more sensitive and caring side towards Bruce but chose Harvey in the end. Michael Caine(Alfred) also delivered as the loyal butler who cares and took care of Bruce as well as Morgan Freeman(Lucius Fox), aiding Batman in the remake of his batsuit, batmobile and use of equipments and technology. Gary Oldman( Lt. James Gordon) also deserves an applaud as Batman's sidekick and police officer as both track down Joker.In short, this is probably one of the best 2008 films but not without its flaws. Firstly, there were too many characters for the given time. Both Joker and Batman were supposedly the main cast but so was Harvey. I wished that he was given more screen time as half-faced because the ending seemed a little rushed. There should be more acknowledgement to his role. Secondly, there were times where I got confused as the film progresses and I couldn't understand the discussions between La(Chinese mobster)and Bruce as well as the significance of Joker's killings. True he killed them to lure out Batman but I couldn't understand why he chose them. I feel that this film will appeal to audiences of a larger age group or those who read the comics. Teenagers might find it hard to understand. I had problems with it initially but after the movie, when I pieced everything together, then it started to make sense."
7281,True,"One thing's for sure: comic book based movies are here to stay. Once before they were B-movie, red headed stepchildren with very miniscule budgets and low grade actors, now these films regularly attract A-list talent both in front and behind the camera. The latest in this summer comic book slate is THE DARK KNIGHT, the sequel to the well received and awesomely successful Batman reboot BATMAN BEGINS and continues right where it left off.Where the first movie dealt with the origins of how and why Batman came to be, this sequel now moves onto a larger canvas: the storyline now revolves around the consequences of Batman's appearance in a city gripped by crime and hopelessness. With the demise of former mob boss Carmine Falcone's power in Gotham City, the various crime syndicates are now leaderless and trying to reconsolidate as Batman (Christian Bale) AKA billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne continues his relentless assault to restore order. In the first film director Chris Nolan portrayed Gotham as a sort of cross between the slums of Hong Kong and Chicago of the Al Capone era with lots of rain and gloom, now Gotham is depicted as being very similar to New York, with many massive high rises and somewhat sunnier skies, it seems Gotham is literally coming back to life.But even with new fearless district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart in his best role to date), it seems the city is just a few steps ahead of the rising tide of criminality that is beginning to strike back against its newfound heroes and it manifests itself into a new and powerful adversary called the Joker (Heath Ledger in his final film role). I have always found that the main differences between the main comic book makers Marvel and DC is in the portrayal of their heroes- whereas Marvel superheroes tend to be average guys and gals who are thrust with superpowers and lots of responsibility, DC superheroes tend to be iconic representations of the human condition: Superman is a depiction of the ideals and greatness of mankind while Batman represents vigilantism and revenge. As the plot of the movie unfolds, the forces of law and order, represented by Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman once again reprises his role and it has been expanded considerably) and Harvey Dent, battle it out on the streets of Gotham city against the forces of criminality with mob bosses Eric Roberts and Michael Jai White (yes, the SPAWN guy is here too) allied with chaos and anarchy which is represented by the Joker with Batman the vigilante smack dab in the middle of it all. Despite Batman being on the side of order, his very methods create a copycat gang of vigilantes who style themselves after him which puts the city even closer to the brink. As all the swirling plot lines culminate into one big showdown, Batman must make his choices carefully as every action he takes creates unintended and sometimes tragic consequences.The last great movie I saw since last year was NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN but I can say that THE DARK KNIGHT finally gives me a satisfaction that I had been missing for over a year now. The acting is superb with many old faces returning- Morgan Freeman is homely as Lucius Fox while Oldman has a larger role and consequently gets to shine even further. Maggie Gyllenhaal as the new Rachel Dawes is an infinitely better actress than her predecessor (though I thought Katie Holmes looked sexier even though she had zero talent) but her role is somewhat subdued and we never got more into her character. Christian Bale is adequate for the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne though he doesn't seem to put in anything new to the character (I still think Micheal Keaton was the best movie Batman). The big question is obviously on Heath Ledger and he delivers a deliciously wicked and sadistic Joker- very similar to Jack Nicholson's take on the character and that's a compliment; my only peeve is that he wasn't given a permanent smile like the previous Jokers in the movie and comic book- slightly different take but still very, very entertaining and fits in well with Nolan's more realistic version of the venerable Bat franchise. It is sad that Ledger will never be able to reprise his role and his makeup seems so similar to that of the equally late Brandon Lee in THE CROW that the parallels are eerie. Unlike the past incarnations of the movie and cartoon Jokers, Ledgers performance has transformed the Joker from a villain with a smile on his face into anarchy incarnate- he is no longer just a bad guy but a force of nature. The big surprise here is Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent- he steals every scene he is in and watching his fall from grace is like seeing that of an epic Shakespearean tragedy.Terrific action sequences and nail biting suspense adds to an epic sequel: 8 out of 10."
7282,True,"Looking over the comments from those who hated this film, I noticed a lot of people complaining that the film has a.) poor editing and cinematography, b.) undeveloped characters, and c.) and incoherent and/or meaningless plot. Not all criticisms say these things; some smart viewers genuinely don't get this film and that's cool. But a LOT of viewers claim the film is both stupid and nihilistic. Let's discuss. (If you're already nodding, cut to the last paragraph).First, it should be noted that the film's cinematographer, Wally Pfister, has already been nominated for an Oscar twice. These nominations are not driven by money or by poor taste; they come from other cinematographers and they speak to the artistry of his work. Pfister is a master of deliberately imperfect framing and visual misdirection. His work isn't easy to watch and his work rewards repeat viewing. It is NOT incoherent and, in fact, most of his scenarios are VERY clear after a while. He makes you work for clarity and why this should be a problem, especially when visual sophistication is something that usually makes films better, is beyond me.Second, the editing, though very rapid, also comes together after repeat viewing. The cuts usually bring together different IDEAS about what a scene means, not just different angles-- that is, the plot information carries thematic information inside it. Those who don't want to work for this information are perfectly entitled not to, but they might reconsider their right to complain about it.Third, concerning character: the critics are right. The characters are in fact ""underdeveloped"" and that's only a problem if you think every film should be judged as if it is a Merchant Ivory production. The fact is, Christopher Nolan is a science fiction director. I don't mean that all his films are science fiction; I just mean that he focuses on ideas, not characters. If you aren't into this, fine, but it's a genre issue, not an issue of quality. Complaining that a science fiction film doesn't have ""well developed characters"" is like claiming that Atonement was a poor film because it didn't have an alien invasion. I liked Atonement and I liked knowing who the characters were and where they were coming from, because it was a work of dramatic realism. In The Dark Knight, the Joker's ""origin"" is NOT THE POINT--which is why he keeps making up various stories about his origin. The point is the social role he plays. It's also not the point that he actually plans things. OF COURSE he actually plans things: he just CLAIMS that he doesn't plan because that's the role he wants to play. Every major character in this film plays a role, a social and public role, and the clash among these roles is the point of the film. Again, if you're not into this, fine, but it's a matter of genre preference, not an issue of what makes a film good or bad. I like Merchant Ivory films, and when I see one I expect well developed characters. But expecting every film to have them is weird.Lastly, the question of the plot. The plot is about terrorism and its meaning for those who are, or might be, victims of it. This is an interesting idea and I think it's handled in an interesting way. We're shown both the evils of terrorism and also--this is the controversial part--the opportunities it provides to test our own willingness to be free. If you didn't ""get"" this when you saw the film, that's cool--but that doesn't mean it wasn't there. It just means you were not, for whatever reason, looking for it.I usually don't bother to write reviews for big-budget stuff, but something about the hypocrisy of the negative reactions to this film really bothers me. First people claim that the film is too dark, not entertaining enough, etc.--in other words it's not the lightweight fantasy fluff they expect from a comic book movie. They go on to complain that they didn't get it, that it was hard to follow, that the characters were unsympathetic, etc. So basically, they condescend to the film for not being easy to watch, which is not exactly a reason to condescend to a film. Some people want comic book movies to be fun and light and that's okay, but if a director wants to use this genre to do something serious, what's wrong with that? If art directors can make comedies, why can't pop-genre directors make serious ""essay"" films about serious topics? Maybe some of us can't accept that serious pop-genre films will NEVER look like Atonement or whatever (for one thing, they won't have ""deep"" characters). For the rest of us, The Dark Knight is a breakthrough."
7283,True,"This is the batman movie I've been waiting for for a very long time . BATMAN BEGINS raised The Bar, THE DARK KNIGHT went above & Beyond . From the moment The Dark Knight begins you are sucked into Gotham City; from the beautiful opening shot, to the end of the opening scene, establishing, the Joker one realizes they are in for something different.THE STORY: Christopher Nolan knows how to get the Job done; along with his brother and David S. Goyer the team have created, replaced and revised making a almost perfect story. This isn't Iron Man folks. If you want to see a story thats predictable and as simple as 'good vs. evil' then go see Iron Man. This film's story is going to challenge what YOU believe in. There are so many grey areas that sometimes you can't even be on the heroes side. You watch the film wondering ""if I was there what would I do?"" and while you may have an answer, can that apply to what these characters believe in? Along with the deep moral thinking the story is filled with some great crime oriented ideas. Joker isn't your average; shoot here, hide there villain. While he claims not to be a guy who plays and says ""I just Do things"" Joker has some pretty serious ideas of how to get the job done. And when Joker wants something done; he gets it done. This isn't the story where the hero narrowly stops the villain, oh no, Joker will be successful at several points of the film. All the while making the film more interesting, you honestly don't know whats coming next and you FEAR for everyone.THE ACTION: The main disapproving argument for Batman Begins was that it was lacking action. Well Christopher Nolan and crew have made sure that one cannot repeat that same statement. The action in this film is more REAL and more INTENSE. The opening is intense; the first Batman scene is intense and the Chase involving the Tumbler Joker and eventually the Batpod is what you go to action movies for. The new Batsuit comes in early and it allows for Batman for more maneuverability as Luscious Fox (Morgan Freeman) says ""You want to move your head"". And much more can be done in this new suit; for the first time we see Batman fighting in wide shots, allowing us to see exactly what he's doing. And the 'new' fighting style designed in Batman Begins is seen more in The Dark Knight. The story's action is relentless; just when you get a break something else terrible happens and the action picks up again. It's a roller coaster ride for roller coaster rides.THE ACTING: This is where the movie is sold the most in my opinion. I give the four biggest nods to Heath Ledger ,Aaron Eckhart,Christian Bale & Gary Oldman . Aaron Eckhart's Dent it totally believable; thusly, making his story all the more sad When he becomes Two-Face. You're going to really Believe in Harvey Dent when watching the film. Gary Oldman is Gordon; this guy makes virtue and doing the right thing, in a world filled with doing the wrong thing, look like candy. His virtue is SO true and his want for a better Gotham is SO real that you love the guy. Oldman is one of the best actors of our time; his portrayal of Gordon is JUST SO GOOD! Finally Gordon does more than just calls Batman with the Bat-signal to help with a situation that is impossible for G.P.D. to deal with on their own. like in the previous films with Burton & Schumacher. I loved Christian Bale back as The Dark Knight, he really embodies the character well . IMO he is the only live action Batman that really captured the true essence of the Character of Batman/ Bruce Wayne that has made him so popular among fans for the last 69 years in the comics & other Adaptations . The only other Batman actor to have accomplished such a task is Kevin Conroy from Batman: The animated series, the definitive voice of Batman . Getting back to Bale I happen to love the voice he has the growling/deep dark voice it's much more believable. It's shows both the anger he still feels from his parents murder & it serves a purpose It shows how far one man will go to be Intimadating. It's so animalistic and aggressive. Which is just what BATMAN is . He's a creature of The Night, A silent guardian, a watchful protector... A DARK KNIGHT...Heath Ledger (first may he R.I.P.) Oh My Goodness. I thought I knew what to expect, I was one of the many, who had been following the viral campaign for 14 months, doing every scavenger hunt, looking at every leaked photo, seeing every trailer, every last commercial, video clip, dissecting his voice, and movements frame by frame, Thought I knew what to expect and I was still Blown completely away. I'm not one to gush over acting too much; I usually say ""good acting"" but this was PERFECT. There is no point where you look and see Heath Ledger, that thing on the screen IS the Joker. From every last twitch, licking of lips, and word he oozes anarchy and genius. What Ledger does for the Joker is something I couldn't think of in my imagination. Ledger is right up their with Mark Hamill in my book as The best version of THE CLOWN PRINCE OF CRIME .forget this reviewGO SEE THIS FILM NOW; STOP READING AND JUST GO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
7284,True,"Don't worry-- this review doesn't contain any plot spoilers. You can't spoil a movie that doesn't have a plot.As I was walking out of the theater I asked another man who had just seen this movie, ""What did you think?"" He said, ""I liked it."" ""Why?"" I asked.""There were really good performances in it,"" he said. ""And the special effects were great."" This made me feel a whole lot better. The moral perversity of this blockbuster movie which had sold out all shows at the theater I saw it at, which is breaking box-office records, and which was applauded by the audience at the end, apparently went over the head of the audience. I realized nobody actually expects good storytelling or anything approaching moral rectitude from a movie anymore. Moviegoers are happy if the movie has high production values.Look, this movie lives up to its hype. Heath Ledger's final performance is brilliant. The movie is a spectacle from beginning to end. Things blow up and cars fly through the air. Lots of people are killed in creative ways.I started yawning about halfway through its 152 minutes.It's not that there isn't good versus evil in this movie. There are scenes that any member of the clergy could use to illustrate a Sunday sermon.The problem with this movie is that there is one and only one character who has a clear and consistent moral vision, who is heroically dedicated to his chosen mission, who is strong and resourceful throughout, who is always one step ahead of his opposition.Where's the problem, you ask? The problem is that this character isn't Batman, who is about as morally tortured as Hamlet. The problem is that the only character with any moral certainty in this Batman movie is the Joker.True, the Joker's mission is the generation of chaos and random destruction. He tests the moral fiber of the heroes and by the end of the movie has compromised all of them.I commented to a friend while walking out of the theater, ""I hate this movie for making me feel as if I'm living in Germany in the 1920's."" He answered me ""That's why I love it. It's a documentary. You are."""
7285,True,"If there ever was a perfect movie, this wasn't it - there are some scenes that are just a bit too cheesy and one actors who performance is a bit too much dizzy schoolgirl, and there is something about it that makes it clash somewhat with the first movie...however there never was a perfect movie but this was the closest I have seen...it is a masterpiece of fear and depression - an opera of violence, yet very few drops of blood, a tale of flawed heroes and pure evil - and Two seconds of hope and faith in humanity that make it grand.I can't believe the best movie I have ever seen, has been a ""comic book movie"" that's not even accurate anymore - the story has evolved to what Batman, the master detective, has always been - a Mob Drama. At it's core is Ledger's Joker - a brilliant performance. When actors want to play a psychopath - this is who they want to play. Hell, real psychopaths wish they were this cold, this insane, this evil. I cannot get his performance out of my head - it was simply brilliant - give him the Oscar.Although, a villain is only as good as his hero, and this movie has two...Bale's Batman is dark and insane is Wayne is pompous and suave and seems effortlessly to be what ""The Dark Night"" would translate to in reality. Eckhart's Harvey Dent is pure plot device...white knight to vengeful killer...but wonderfully executed. The rest of the cast is wonderful as...with the exception of the Dawes character (not bad just the weakest in the film) The story, the plot, its a grand tale of a murderous terrorist holding a city hostage and it incredible...I said Oscar earlier fr ledger, I think Oscar for the Dark Knight as well - we need to reward cinema this great!"
7286,True,"Just like the joker, I am also a little curious about the primitive nature of human beings in our society. Not that I'm immune myself, but it always amazes me to see the exponential effect of hype... to watch humans horde into a frenzy of blissful ignorance.Let me make myself clear. Heath Ledger's performance alone is worth the ticket price to see this movie. He is stunning and he destroys JAck Nicholson's performance... and I say this knowing that I had previously thought, no one can do joker as good as Jack Nicholson.But Joker is only a third of this movie, and a shame in hindsight.The rest of this film is a just mish mash of tension, pace, plot and action.1. Christopher Nolan struggles with action scenes. They are confusing, chaotic, and illogical which culminates into an underwhelming visceral and cerebral experience. Somewhat boring.2. Batman is a lifeless and dull character. In 'batman begins' this was OK because he was mostly swinging from the corner of the screen, like a predator, but given a more open role, Batman in a cape was distracting. His metamorphosis as batman was absorbing to experience in the first film, but the conflicts he faces in this sequel pale in comparison. Batman is too sensitive and too poetic in his choice of resolutions. Ready to reveal his identity too quickly and ready to become a dark knight based on the pompous premise... Dent must remain the white light.3. Two face is an oddball. An oddball of creation, of reaction and of evolution. His arch is a forced effort by Nolan. It doesn't make sense for him to kill Gordon's family. Dent himself commented that he knew his job was dangerous. He knew that there were bad people after him. Why the sudden transformation when this happened? The transformation of Two face was based on the premise of his philosophical awakening.. That to believe in chance... is to believe in chaos... but i cant believe this would cause such an explosive change in him... willing to kill a child. It doesn't make sense. Two face as caricature was not near as engaging or entertaining.4. The pacing of this film is poor. There are moments where it is too fast, and moments where the film is too slow. Effectively, I think the movie should have ended sooner. It dragged out, and I was mostly non-responsive to the conclusion of two face.5. Ultimately for a movie to be amazing one must come out of a cinema and be amazed. I didn't like the movie in its entirety. And I truly believe that had Heath Ledger not been involved in Dark Knight, the general consensus would have been a lot different, and the flaws a lot more glaringly obvious. This was a 2.5 hour movie in which everything but Joker was underwhelming.It was a good movie, but given the hype, its now everyone's favorite film of all time... as the IMDb ratings might soon suggest."
7287,True,"The hype has been OTT, but for once it is justified. 'The Dark Knight' is all you've been led to believe, and more. Christian Bale returns as the caped crusader, the vigilante looking after the streets of Gotham by night, and this time he has a new and dangerous foe, The Joker (played by Heath Ledger, of more later). This nemesis takes the Batman series into chilling territory, far beyond the bam! bang! of the old 60s series with Adam West. It's never been quite this dark before.Is this a film for under-twelves, as the British certification suggests? Absolutely not. For a start, it is wordy, with an intelligent script and involving characters, which might get little ones fidgeting. Then there is the violence - mostly implied, but unpleasant and set to give shivers down the spine nonetheless. You see some gore and through jarring music, sound effects and shaky video footage you can imagine a lot more. The worst thing in marketing this film to a young audience is glorifying knife killing, if you view a psychopath as a hero.Bale is OK, a little dry as Bruce Wayne, but more than adequate. Michael Caine reprises his role as Alfred and is not bad at all, although someone prepared to do another accent might have been interesting. Maggie Gyllenhaal is slightly annoying as Rachel, but since her character isn't there to do much, it doesn't really matter. And Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman are solid in support as Harvey and Gordon.Back to Heath Ledger. The publicity surrounding his performance in this has reached ridiculous heights due to his early death at the beginning of the year, but he really does steal the film and pull off an amazing performance as a truly nasty villain who manages to be comic in the blackest of ways as well. Whether walking away from a blazing hospital in a nurse's uniform with a detonator that keeps jamming, or taunting police officers from the floor of a jail, or standing in the path of a motorbike bellowing 'Hit me' his performance is absolutely electric and by far the best thing about this film.Could another actor have made the same impact? I doubt it. And that's what gives 'The Dark Knight', for me, the edge over other blockbusters this year. Seen on IMAX screens, it is also mind-blowing in its effects and scope."
7288,True,"This film is long at over 2 1/2 hours but that is because it does so much right that it takes that long to do the job. Everyone in the cast is terrific. The action is almost non-stop for this film too.Michael Caine is even better in this film than he was in Batman Begins. Morgan Freeman who has been busy this year (also in Wanted this summer) is fantastic. The film has times where the action is so intense that you almost get lost but it picks you up and doesn't let you get lost. Kudos to Christian Bale as he is even better here than in Batman Begins.Heath Ledger as the Joker is the big story. This is not a Joker like before, as this one is totally out there (and don't ask me where there is). His criminal activity is defined as unusually bizarre. He says it himself when he says in the movie that he just goes where he wants without any reason for what he is doing. The Joker actually starts the film robbing a bank. By the end of the movie, he has made that bank robbery seem and actually be pointless. The robbery is just a place to start the movie.The film starts dark & ends darker with very little light in the middle. It kills off people often and even one of the main roles is killed. It gives viewers a delightful UN-predictability not just too the Joker but to where the film is going.That is pretty much what makes this film go. I doubt than any film will top it this year. It even leaves Wanted in the dust grasping to catch up."
7289,True,"I saw this movie, just last night, at an advanced screening for the theater. I was not terribly looking forward to it initially because I figured it was just another Batman movie. Yes, Christopher Nolan was directing it and he also directed the movie that renewed my faith in the Batman series (Batman Begins), but it was just another sequel in my mind. wait for it to come to DVD, I thought. So my friend got me a free ticket to this screening and I went. All I can say is this (and I am not exaggerating): It Is THE Best Superhero Movie EVER. A true psychological thriller, Nolan slowly builds the suspense, terror and madness each minute you watch. At first, Oh sure it's the Joker. Biiig deal, he kills some of his own henchmen. But gradually, the diabolical mind behind the clownface emerges (demonstrated absolutely flawlessly by the late Heath Ledger). Batman, played by Christian Bale, is as dark and brooding as he was in Begins. His gadgetry and the quality of his costume is improving, but he is also gaining admirers in some strange places as small-time criminals begin to emulate him--something he refuses to accept, they ARE criminals after all. Bale's portrayal is perfect. Vengeful anti-hero by night, Billionaire jackass by day. In this movie, he is charged with cleaning up the mob from the Gotham City streets. Utilizing the legal powers of Dent and Gordon's access to city officials, he does this, clearing Gotham of the scum in one magnificent swoop. Hooray for our hero. Fortunately, the movie does not end there. A string of deaths occurs, all masterminded by the same diabolical villain and Batman makes it his personal quest to rid the world of the Joker. As people begin to blame him for the mounting hysteria, Bruce Wayne begins to falter. Drawing into himself, he tries to shoulder the responsibility onto Dent more and more. But Dent has a weakness, the same one Bruce does. And when she dies, with Dent listening over a radio, it is the final straw breaking for him. Maggie Gylenhaal portrays the role of Rachel Dawes, thankfully, grabbing it from the poor acting of Katie Holmes. Rachel's role is fairly minor, unfortunately, but there really is no back story to her. Not in the comic anyway. While Gylenhaal is there, she plays a much better Rachel than Holmes...though that is not saying much. Aaron Eckhardt, a man I almost immediately recognized from his role as the main character of ""Thank You For Smoking"", plays the 'White Knight of Gotham', D.A. Harvey Dent. This is a man destined to plummet into the depths of complete and utter insanity, as the villain Two-Face. Everyone in the theater saw it coming when he did. That doesn't take away from Eckhardt's portrayal of the driven Dent, who allies with Batman and James Gordon to rid Gotham City of the Mob. He is equally magnificent in his fall. I never forgave Tommy Lee Jones for destroying my vision of Two-Face in Batman Forever...but there were a lot of mistakes in that movie. I digress. Two-Face may be a psychotic, but he is NOT a giggling, twerpy psychotic. He retains Dent's drive and powerful charisma. Eckhardt and Nolan flesh this out beautifully. But all of this pales in comparison to Heath Ledger's Joker. The movie may be about Batman, but it is the Joker's movie, without question. I had always felt that Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker was done well. It was cartoonish to Ledger's maniacal villain. From the outset, as he so deviously states, he is out to ""send a message."" The message is that anyone in this ""sophisticated"" society that we cling to can fall to his depths with just the right push. His very demeanor was so creepy and so histrionic that it had everyone in the theater on the edges of their seats. And he wins, in spades, as he finds a way of turning Gotham's ""greatest hope"" and the man Batman sees as his public face, into something similar to him. Ledger, for those two and a half hours, is the embodiment of the chaos of the Joker. He captivates. It may be the most incredible bit of acting I have ever seen.But don't take my word for it. Go see the movie."
7290,True,"I'll keep this short.I rarely go to the theater, but with the hype I had to go see this. Batman and the Joker are invincible characters. You know they won't die. Plot hole: the police have the Joker in an interrogation room, with 30 officers on the other side of a 1-way mirror, and the Joker just killed the Mayor the day before. What do the police do? Any logical person in that situation would kill the Joker. Period. Just shoot him. I nearly walked out of the theater when the Joker escaped (imagine that!) Here's the thing. The Joker isn't a serial villain here. He's a terrorist. He's Osama bin Laden. Normal rules of police interrogation shouldn't apply here. And where's the military? the FBI? This story made no sense to me. Well I tried to keep this short. I want my 2.5 hours of my life back."
7291,True,"Batman returns to the big screen once again in The Dark Knight, sequel to already brilliant Batman Begins. But as good as Batman Begins is, this truly is epic in comparison. Christopher Nolan returns again as the director and co-writer and creates the movie of his career. As we all know, the hype was everywhere. Many were skeptic of whether it would live up to it. And it didn't. It surpassed it! Even after waiting a whole week for the brilliance of The Dark Knight to fully set in and assure myself I, myself, wasn't just caught up in the hype, the only thing I can still say is, ""Wow"". There really is no place to start. The acting, the writing, the plot structure, effects, action scenes - each of these showing the best of what cinema has to show for each section. But, in a messy, misguided attempt, I will start with what I saw as the most impressive arc of The Dark Knight, the acting.Now, I think we all know who steals the show. It is, undeniably, that of Heath's performance as the Joker. This truly is a milestone in film history and is definitely the performance of Heath's life (no pun intended). It's up there with such unforgettable legendary roles as Marlon Brando as Don Vitto in both dedication and delivery and a posthumous Oscar is well on its way. Every minute he is on screen, your eyes devour it, savoring every second he appears, and craving it again once he is gone. But as good as Heath is (and he really is that good), you cannot oversee the other excellent performances by many of the cast, especially that of DA Harvey Dent by Aaron Eckhart, who tragically becomes Two-Face later on. And who ever thought Gary Oldman could be versatile enough to play such a good character so damn well.Well, let's move onto the next aspect of The Dark Knight that I saw as almost impeccable. The script. Once again, the Joker's script is one that any writer can only ever dream of writing, full of clever wit and some of the best quotes cinematography will ever be graced to. Every word is like a piece of beautifully woven poetry, but not only that of Heath's but by everyone.But aside from all the genius that is packed into this almost 3-hour masterpiece, it is not perfect, just like any other film. And to push aside these blemishes and try and forget them would be ignorant. The first problem seems to be a case of too much to do in too little time. I felt the plot structure, as good, no excellent, it is, it is a little messy and I just felt Nolan tried to bite off a bit more than he could chew. No, more like a nibble. Also, we can't deny that, even with a change from Holmes to Gyllenhaal, Rachel's character is just plain badly written. Though Gyllenhaal's performance was a fresh breath of air and her acting overshadowed that of Holmes, it still had that same dry, bland feeling I felt with Holmes. Finally, I did think the ending, the last 15 minutes or so, were a bit drawn out, filled with what are good final quotes, but utter spoon feeding.But believe me, it took me a week of nit-picking to find any faults, and all of them are very small. Even with all that said, this movie is a triumph and must be seen by everyone.Hamish Kearvell A.K.A Screaming Japan Pictures - www.myspace.com/screamingjapanpictures"
7292,True,"Loved Batman Begins. Then it seems like Christopher Nolan lost his love-if he ever had it - for the source material. I am a huge Batman fan and will give any adaptation my full support. I can usually get something out of it. The more I watch the 2 Dark Knight movies, the more I hate them, and the more I think that Nolan was never a Batman fan.The stories are poorly thought out but that's not exactly Nolan's fault. It's how he introduces our heroes and villains that make me question his passion for the projects. In a scene that looks like it was shot by my older brother and his friends with a $40 video camera, Batman is introduced only after seeing a few pathetic Batman copycats, then we see him running through a parkade, after a car. He is indistinguishable at this point from the copycats. Not how I wanna be reintroduced to my favorite comic book character - in a fluorescent lit parkade, uncertain if it's even him. Where's the mystique? Wheres the darkness? The mythos? Where's the fear he's supposed to bring with him? It's all washed out.The second bad ENTRANCE was with, the most significant villain in comic book lore, the Joker. I know everybody loves Heath (R.I.P) but I cannot approve of his portrayal. Firstly, the Joker, THE JOKER, is introduced when he casually walks into a scene reminiscent of a scene out of Dick Tracy, where a bunch of corny, campy, bad guys exchange dialogue in what is supposed to be a meeting of Gotham's underworld kings. Then, some nobody strolls into this BASEMENT with his henchmen, like a background character might, does some tongue acting, then puts the screws to the crime bosses with no opposition. How did the Joker even find out about this meeting? And how was he allowed to waltz in - with no charisma might I say. Where's the evil? Where's the man behind the face paint? Where's the unbridled lunacy? The key to a good villain is that you want to hate him but you can't help but love him. I couldn't find the Joker, a Joker, any Joker, in any minute of Ledgers performance. His characters ability to predict the multitude of variables that had to occur for his plan to go off is unbelievable, even for the truest of believers. Agent of chaos or not, I need my Joker to be somewhat grounded, connected to something, to have SOME motivation. Some cause for his direction.I've already been lambasted by the people around me so I understand if this review will upset people. Im happy there are so many die-hard, passionate Dark Knight fans. But I have to state what is so obvious to me: shot for shot, this is a train wreck. Oldmans comatose performance as Gordon, the purposeless, tacked-on fight scene near the end of the movie. All of it. Just can't do it.It's plot is challenging in many ways, absolutely stupid in most others. No rendition will ever ruin Batman for me. But the follow-up, Dark Knight Rises - which I also hated - cemented to me, the lack of love on Nolan's part."
7293,True,"This is not a Batman movie. It is just wrong. Again with the realism! Batman isn't supposed to be realistic and when you make Batman realistic it doesn't feel like Batman anymore. This movie is full of speeches! All the Joker does is vomit up dialogue. He also doesn't even look like the Joker. The Joker is supposed to use toy-like gadgets and weapons not all real weapons. Now onto Batman. Christian Bale is once again terrible and is not fitting in the role. His voice is the worst voice ever! This also has to be the most overrated film of all time. People rave that this is the best Batman movie ever. No it isn't! This doesn't even feel or look like a Batman movie. This is even less creative than Batman Begins. It is also even more boring. I am so sad to see my favorite superhero be reduced to a growling, dancing, and uninteresting character. Nolan is to into making his Batman films realistic that he forgets one of the most important that make a Batman movie and that is creativity. You have to be creative when making a film on any superhero especially Batman. It is just something that lacks in his Batman films. This is such a bad movie."
7294,True,"I wonder why this film received that much positive reviews , compared to batman begins , this film is a much weaker one , The action is not that much as i expected, and it was not in good quality also , the plot was also weak , the origin of the joker is not shown in the film , however in such kinds of superhero films , describing the origin of the villain makes the story more interesting , at least a background of the villain could have been described to make joker more interesting . A joker without an origin or background is nothing but a psychopath,sadistic and an empty characther that creates meaningless violence ,an exciting violence that impresses the audience must be a meaningful one however , and this requires an origin of the villain.(remember the origin of jack nicholson's joker in batman 1989 , the background was fully described) At the fifth minute of the film , poof here comes the joker , what's wrong with him?,what happened to him? , we don't know , all we do know about joker in this film is his face, his laugh and his sadistic characther , which are simply not enough for one of the most famous evil characthers of all times.In addition , if we consider the amount and quality of the action films in the previous decade , the action in this movie was poor.Forget the previous decade , The terminator 2 for example is from 1991 and it was made as if it has much more technology than this poor dark knight.How about the other mob bosses , they are also very important and supposed to move with joker , they are completely ignored in this film , Salvatore maroni is an important characther in batman , however he is not even an interest in the film.He must have been.The ending was disastrous , terrible by all means , couldn't they think about a more creative ending? And how the hell this joker guy in dark knight manages to beat the whole city, it's police force and other mob bosses , with nothing in hand but a few punks? He has no army , no money , no guns nothing . 8.9 are you kidding?"
7295,True,"Well...First of all ,the whole story and plot got nothing to do with the original comic-book story (which already makes it even more unauthentic and unwatchable then it already is...). The Joker basically had some help killing the mobsters of Gotham City along with other 'freaks' /Batman's foes like him -like Two Face ,Poison Ivy etc').Second ,the movie changed the whole atmosphere and story into a shallow script with too much special effects and CGI not mentioning big stunts and the same predictable and uninspired below mediocre kind of plot common to most action movies and comic-based movies these days.And besides ,the acting and direction were just bad and some characters seemed not convincing and stupid not mentioning the way the writers changed some important /key characters like the Joker (Heath Ledger was just weird...he didn't fit to the Joker's role). In conclusion : a complete waste of time including your brain cells ,an endless and unwatchable crapfest--an overrated and over-hyped lame knight who is not a gentleman ,nor a good movie or a good comic book adaption."
7296,True,"So... What I'm getting is there's this Dominatrix running around with a cape, funny ears, and a husky/scary/arousing voice. Who also beats up guys in parking garages, but none of them got aroused, so the story didn't go anywhere. She probably should have whipped them. also there was this rich guy who it showed a lot, but he didn't really have anything to do with the story. It was strange. But on the other hand there is that buxom green haired lady who gets beat by the Dominatrix and then dresses up as a nurse. I'd buy that for a dollar. Anyday. I think the Dominatrix probably should have got slightly naked, she's got some big pecs if you know what I mean and I would have liked to find out if the carpet matched the drapes. Like, That's the stuff I would bump into on the street ""by accident"". That Gordon guy had a moustache that made me wonder... But I digress, there was a lot of teasing, without any climactic moments of trepidating fulfillment, or masochistic zeal. I was appalled, disappointed, and, finally, ashamed. It almost makes you wonder how director Christopher Nolan even thought he was making an erotic film."
7297,True,"I was never a fan of the batman comics or the cartoons but found batman begins extremely entertaining and certainly did revive the franchise. The dark knight was good but again over-hyped due to mainstreams movie viewers saying its best movie ever so they look cool. Im sure there's a lot of you out there calling this the best movie ever who said the same thing about transformers, transformers 2, pirates of Caribbeans etc. Those people really need to stop because it does not make you look or sound intelligent or have good taste at all.Let me start with the pros. The designs in this film is top notch, from the batman armor to the bat mobile and particularly the joker. Some of the stuns were actually pretty good also (eg. Kinapping Asian mob accountant from hong Kong. Christian bale who is one of my favorite actor was good enough, not brilliant, just good enough. The joker played by ledger was funny and at the same time repulsive. For instance when he interrupted the mob meeting, placed a pencil on the table and said ""you wanna see a magic trick?"" and preceded to smashing a bodyguard's head into the pencil. It was a very nice touch and established the jokers personality earlier on.OK, now onto the bad stuffs. Aaron Eckhart was never my favorite actor and again this film reminded me why. Its not the fact that he cant act but you can never quite take him serious enough, which is bad in a movie as dark as this.. The only annoying thing i found about him was his voice when he is batman, i know he is trying to hide his identity but the growling was just overdone at times.Also, the story was Way too long, very choppy with some elements completely unnecessary, like the bombs on the 2 ferries at the end. And whats with batman and getting his ass kicked by dogs, i mean hes got all these Fancy gadgets but doesn't even have some sort of taser to deal with the dogs? instead he rolled around on the ground looking like an idiot while the joker hit him with a steel pipe doing no damage at all. Hardly good actions in my opinion.In conclusion, The dark knight is an OK action film with its shares of good and bads. But as always its the story development and length which stopped it from becoming a great film like its predecessor. That being said, it is certainly a decent rent worth its money just don't believe the hypes and 10/10 comments by these hypocrites."
7298,True,"First of all The Dark Knight is a good film and is worth a watch. Yet (imho) lacking a heart or a soul. Nolan does it again, he seemed certain to deliver a worthy action movie and for about half a film almost succeeds, but then succumbs to overload temptation and delivers a messy, overblown epic that resembles two Batman films hastily edited into one. Plus it is way too violent and graphic with knives and gun's for 12A. Plus the story completely focuses on Joker. Well this is maybe a good thing because Heath Ledger (R.I.P.) delivers a great performance, much better than Bale's wooden acting. I am not going to talk about Bale's vocal performance when he wears the Batman suit; awful..My favourite line was ""I can make this pencil disappear..."" *slams pencil into other man's face* ""...and...it's gone."". This is good humour but that's about it for me.If you want to see a good dark action movie go see V for Vendetta. It was a much better film in my humble opinion."
7299,True,"How can you say it surpassed Batman Begins in all ways, I was disappointed because it wasn't nearly as good as the last film. It lacked a plot at times, dragged on and the whole two face bit was a waste of time. It had potential to be a really good film but it just didn't cut it for me. Shorten the film and remove two face (alternatively not kill him off to set him up for the next film) and it could be brilliant. It certainly doesn't deserve to be in the top 10 films of all time, in fact I wouldn't put it in the top 250. Don't get me wrong, there were some good scenes and Ledgers performance was brilliant making it a good film, but certainly not as good as some people are making it out to be."
7300,True,"Heath Ledger and the FX for the first hour were the only redeeming things about this movie.Ledger certainly deserves an Oscar for this film, not because he's dead but because he was amazing as the Joker. His performance as the essence of deranged evil, he was astounding, this despite the fact that the writer had him pontificating on the nature of man and chaos theory. It was the physical performance that was extraordinary. The scene of the Joker prancing around in the nurse's uniform was surreal and hysterical at the same time (but maybe that's part of surrealism.Once the movie reached a point where it seemed to be repeating special effects just to do so, it lost me. It was WAY too long, repetitive & pseudo-intellectual."
7301,True,"Are U all kidding me? Should this be considered to be one of the top 100 movies of all times? Personally I regret seeing this crap in the theater. It would have been more suitable as a decent ""sunday-hangover-movie"".I must however confess that Heath Ledger is stunning in his interpretation of ""The Joker"", probably one of the best movie-screen villains so far, but then he is the only good thing in this movie.Let me break it down for y'all:The fights sucks big time: I've seen better fight scenes on baywatch (when Mitch Buchannon takes up shootfighting). They are to short, to ""blurred"" and there are only like five of 'em in the entire 2.5 hour long movie.The acting is mediocre: Apart from Ledger the entire cast is totally underachieving. Christian Bale just reminds me of Keanu Reeves (2 facial expressions throughout the entire movie) and the great Michael Cain is in my opinion starting to get tiresome to watch as the kind, tired and concerned butler.As far as the storyline goes it might as well have been created out of a predefined Hollywood mold (which it is for sure). The dark troubled antihero who is starting to doubt his purpose, the love triangle that ""shakes the foundation"" of our heroes believes (Spiderman anybody?) and the creation and renewal of new gear and gadgets to satisfy all the ""techno/scifi-freaks"" out there. So gdm simple and uncreative its truly laughable but then what can one expect from a simple superhero movie?The only reason this movie gets a 5 out of 10 from me is its potential as a enjoyable ""hangovermovie"" the good cinematography and Ledgers performance.Ps. Would be fun to count the number of times ""terrorist"" or ""terrorism"" is mentioned in the movie? Or perhaps the number of times Ledger emphasizes how much ""havoc you can create with just a couple of barrels of gas and some dynamite"". Feels a lot like propaganda in my book."
7302,True,"Quite possibly the most over hyped and overrated pile of junk in my lifetime.Batman Begins was a fine movie and apart from the frankly terrible scarecrow, was an enjoyable watch.The Dark Knight was hailed as as masterpiece, I disagree. Heath Ledger was not a Joker. If it had been a villain called something else i would not have had a problem but this is so far away from the source material that it makes no sense for them to even refer to him as the joker. Jack Nicholson was better in every way. Two face was good but hardly used at all. On top of all of that the whole idea of making a film about a comic book 'realistic' is pointless, the whole idea of batman is unrealistic, just the way it should be.To all those people who say 'this film is darker which makes it better' you are all forgetting what happens, the joker actually dies in the 1989 film, no one dies in this.If you are a fan of classic batman, DO NOT watch this film, stick with the vastly superior Tim Burton film!"
7303,True,"Well, what can I say. This makes Batman Begins seem terrible. Christian Bale's Batman/Bruce Wayne is on top form and better than ever(Especially with the scene involving the jump off the IFS in Hong Kong). I would hugely recommend that you watch this film. I've seen hundreds of films and in my opinion this is the best of them all. Heath Ledger's Joker was fantastic. He brought humour and action to the whole film. I must say that Ledger's Joker has to be better than Nicholson's 1989 portrayal however the jokes were not of the same calibre. Anyway, this film had it all - the action - the jokes. The storyline was great. It showed the joker's rise to power and it had plenty of action to help. Especially with the Party Crash scene, the street scene where the tumbler explodes :( (But there is a surprise at this point), and when Gotham General hospital has some structural re-modifications ( Gets blown up). The ending lacked a bit of fight from both batman and the joker and both should have suffered a few more cuts and bruises. Anyway the whole film was brilliant and a must see for all movie lovers. Absolutely brilliant film that balances -suspense- action - laughter and adventure. Absolutely brilliant, just like the cast and the director. What more can I say?"
7304,True,"The Dark Knight was a marvelous film. It shows us what a city might be like with potentially ""unstoppable"" criminals and corrupt police officers.My favorite content that the movie had was showing us what can really happen. Corruption has taken over GPD, and Gothem is becoming a horrible city. Some of the criminal tactics are just horrific. A world where the police have ""no power"" can scare the bejeezus out of anyone.The cast and soundtrack were also excellent. My favorites were Morgan Freeman(Lucky # Slevin) and Aaron Eckhart(The Black Dahlia). Christain Bale was also excellent in the film. The soundtracks were terrific. Hans Zimmer(Pearl Harbor Soundtrack) made the movie come to life. Everyone knows that a movie is not a true movie without an excellent soundtrack, and The Dark Knight truly proves that point. Imagine the movie ""Titanic"" without the music. It would not be as good. Same thing applies for any movie.The movie was an excellent action thriller. 10 out of 10 stars is not enough!!!"
7305,True,"Three and a half years after the hype, sycophantic reviews, and mass hysteria have died down I am now ready to review this film with a level-headed opinion. Is it good. Yes, quite. Is it the icon of intelligent summer movie perfect that the fanboys proclaim it to be? No, certainly not. The Dark Knight has faults, not the least of which is the unjustifiably bloated running time.With criminals in Gotham now looking over their shoulders (or should I say to the sky) for Batman, the crime-rate is gradually falling. But when anarchic, nihilistic Joker appears to stir things up between the cops and crooks the fight against crime is cranked up to the max. The Joker is out to create as much chaos as possible, not caring for himself or others. Meanwhile District Attorney Harvey Dent tackles the criminals as honestly as he can with Rachel Dawes glassy-eyed and Bruce Wayne competing for her affections. This is spread out over 153 minutes, and in long stretches you'll begin to feel every second of it.Much of this film's running time could have been trimmed and many scenes jettisoned. I know I am not alone in admitting that a sequence midway through the film involving dead bodies in an apartment and the re-building of a shattered bullet just confuses me. The sequence seems to come out of nowhere. I know Batman is supposed to be a detective but this was just nonsense. Nolan could have come up with a better method of leading Bruce Wayne to the trap with the window and sunshade. Also, there is a moment near the end when Salvatore Marone tells Commissioner Gordon that he knows where the Joker's going to be. Nothing becomes of this.You'd have to be pretty stupid not to connect the dots when it comes to the corrupt cops who sell-out Gordon at every opportunity too. Real lazy writing there. I just couldn't get involved with Harvey Dent either. His story, struggle, and motivations did not interest me in the slightest and I found the character flat and boring. Gary Oldman as Gordon also bored me to tears. What exactly are we supposed to like about this character? With the exception of temporally faking his own death he never once proved himself to be competent. I longed for the Joker to show up and put them all out of my misery. Not much of the dialogue is memorable. It sounds as if the characters are talking out to the audience while none of the words actually gel and no eye-lines connect. Little of it feels like a realistic conversation. It's virtually all just perfectly rehearsed movie dialogue from over-written comic-book characters.I wish that Nolan would stop shying away from violence. When you watch the movie closely you'll notice you never actually see anything. The pencil trick happens fast (and off-screen), no blood effects follow gunfire, few of the punches are seen connecting. I understand the need to keep it a PG-13 but come on! Aside from a car and helicopter explosion there aren't many deaths seen occurring on screen, most of the time leaving you wondering what happened (as with Gambol's death).There are entertaining and breathtaking spectacles within The Dark Knight, but take away Bruce Wayne and the Joker and you're left with nothing at all that could identify this story or setting as something that truly belongs in the Batman universe.Like Batman Begins, it's all so straight and brick-faced. I really ought to ask Christopher Nolan ""Why so serious?"""
7306,True,"As much as Adam West and Burt Ward took the Caped Crusader to the goofy extreme of his incarnations' scale, this movie took him to the opposite, un-Batman-like, dark extreme of it. You leave the movie with a very bad feeling, that's all. If I wanted to see what the movie shows, I wouldn't have looked for a Bat-movie. It's just one very sad movie.Impressions aside, here is a more objective analysis: 1. Why can't screen writers just change the plot when an actress doesn't feel like reliving her role? If Katie Holmes didn't want a rerun, why just not leave her character out of the movie? Using another actress to replace her is just a very bad idea! It doesn't work. It didn't work.2. One more comic hero movie where a recurrent villain in the comics dies at his very first appearance in the movie. Hello Harvey! Adieu, Harvey! It looks like those guys can't resist the temptation of repeating that bad formula, as well as the equally bad formula of putting at least to recurring villains together in the same movie...3. Just one more Joker-movie...4. Bat-fighting: Batman Begins hit the spot in terms of choreography, fighting style and speed, but failed in what came to camera angle: you just couldn't see anything, so close the camera was and so fast was the action. Dark Knight tried to correct those flaws, but in turn the fight speed and fluidity was totally lost. It looked as if Christian Bale didn't rehearse as much as he should.5. The old problem with the cowl... Batman gained a new, flexible cowl, thus somehow solving the ""stiff neck"" issue that plagued the character since his first appearance in the movies. However, in doing so, Batman lost its famous football linebacker neck. I'll give you a hint for the next movies that will resolve this dilemma once and for all; something you've never heard before: C.G."
7307,True,"Like most people, I am familiar with Batman. I read Frank Miller's gritty Dark Knight Returns comic in the 1980s, but also watched with glee the comic spoof of the 1960s TV series. I enjoyed the Tim Burton Gothic fairytale, and even the rather dour Batman Begins. But a few minutes into this movie, I thought to myself ""What is this? It isn't Batman!"" This was like a grumpy James Bond. And that feeling lingered throughout the film. This is just my opinion - but I didn't see Batman anywhere here. From Christian Bale's gargling caped spy to the Heath Ledger's raspy bank robber with make-up, I found myself longing for an actual Batman story. Batman would NOT do the things the does in this film - he does not let his lady love die to protect the career of an attorney. If the filmmakers wanted to see how to solve this problem, they should have watched Spider-Man. Yes, his motivations are complex, but in this film he positively revels in doing the wrong thing. He is a soulless instrument of the law - not a vigilante - not even someone interested in justice. And I for one am sick of people talking to him, turning away, then looking back to see he has disappeared! If he was that fast how come he couldn't dispose of both bombs at once?Many people have ruminated on the deep philosophical questions asked by this movie. Yet they don't make sense. The film is turgid, doesn't make it's points clearly, and contradicts itself. The message at one point is that people can make the right decisions. Yet Batman himself makes the wrong decision - as shown by what happens to Harvey Dent. And the final scene seems to contradict this point - people get the hero they need, not that they deserve. It seems the writers were going for as many profoundly deep points they could make, without bothering to string them together into a coherent drama. This is one of the few movies (and certainly the only superhero movie) that I ever felt like walking out of - especially during the Harvey Dent subplot that feels like an extra 30 minutes tacked on to the story for no good reason - and haven't we even seen this before in Batman Forever?In short, this over-hyped, bloated movie didn't - for me at least - live up to its expectations. It wasn't Batman, and I'm not sure I know what it is."
7308,True,"I just HAD to comment on the Dark Knight after reading all these hyped ratings and reviews. Watched it last night; generally like superheroes and comic books; really enjoyed Batman Begins.Now, to make this brief, here are my beefs: 1. So what if there are multiple big names in this movie? Some of the best movies ever made starred next to nobodies. I do not assume a movie will be great because the budget could afford ""big names"". These performances were good, granted, but not the stellar masterpiece some would have you believe.2. The story was awesome - every fan loves a back-story. But come on, the effects for Two-Face were disappointing at best (i.e. flesh burned off his face and the left eye still perfectly fine and moving around as if it didn't need a good blink every now and then? Also, in the opening scene, why would the bank manager lay there without removing a supposed explosive from his mouth? ALSO, the cliché struggle of the female lead, ""torn' between two men...come on....been there in Spiderman and I personally thought she was a tramp for bouncing back and forth between them.I think I'll stop there: I wrote this review only out of utter astonishment that it is currently rating a 9 out of 10 with over 300, 000 votes. I guess you could argue that makes me the exception and therefore wrong, but come on folks, this is not MUCH more than more Hollywood garbage and we keep sitting down at the table to shovel in more. UG! I think the movie is good - 6/10. Heath Ledger's performance is the best part of the movie - the only reason I give it a 6/10. But the day a movie like this rates higher than the ""classics"" (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Blade Runner, The Thing, etc) in actual quality has not yet arrived in my opinion.Rent it, yes, but don't be fooled the adolescent, feverish enthusiasm of comic book ""aficionados"" that has made people think this is one of the best films ever made. This is another superhero movie...plain and (very) simple."
7309,True,"It seems that hype really does work for the masses. They easily succumb to what larger, more powerful entities want them to like. It's shocking and scary, really. This movie, in my opinion, and it is mine and I do not care what anyone has to say, is a perfect example.I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't bad but it definitely was not great. I liked the pace of the movie and some of the acting is OK. I did not like the joker character, though. The joker was quite boring and not flamboyant enough. The dude that played the joker did an OK job but the writing for it really fell below the waterline and I felt that the script was boring and uninspired. This was more of an eye candy movie.Christian as Batman still bums me out. He is simply not a good choice for Batman nor is he a good choice for Bruce Wayne. It just does not feel correct.Unfortunately for this movie, my favorite scene(s) involved that beautiful Murcielago with the painted six piston calipers. That was the most beautiful thing in this movie. It broke my heart to see it smashed. I couldn't help but feel that this movie minus the costumes could have been named Die Hard 5. It had that same momentum and feel.It was still a good movie. It was just not a GREAT movie."
7310,True,"The Dark Knight, in my humble opinion, is nothing less than a masterpiece. But there are different colors for different tastes, but don't worry, I won't say ""you are a fool if you didn't like it"".Why is this movie a masterpiece? Well, here we go.... Let's have something clear first: this movie is not about Batman, is about Gotham city. I live in a country intoxicated with corruption, and after all these years, well, let's say you can expect anything... But, recently, there's a new possible president, and, as the way everybody is seeing it, he will be our Harvey Dent... Let's just hope he won't have an accident involving gasoline and fire!...Anyway... I think a movie is a masterpiece when it can portrait this things in a very actual and natural way (like Costa-Gavra's Z), how great cities are made of! when you know the basics in sociology, philosophy and psychology, you realize there's no good or evil, everything is relative. There is only one thing we can achieve: the greater good. But this is not something you can achieve in one day, is something you have to go a very long way just to have a glimpse. There are a lot of great movies and books that had portray this in a very faithful way. Like Goehte's Faust.Between the lights and shades, you can see a great city sunk in corruption, drugs and misery, hoping for someone who can actually fight for their rights, making real justice. And as you saw in the movie, Harvey Dent, The white knight, is this person. Too bad he had the accident, but Hey! there's always irony in our universe.You have to see and explore the dark so you can comprehend the light, and I think Nolan has always known this, and that is why I love all of his films.At the end of the movie, neither Dent nor Batman can prove by their own means to be the hero Gotham wants, but needs. And they make this sacrifice for, as you know, the greater good... Glorious... I left the cinema with tears in my eyes... remembering a lot of sacrifices in real life, made by real heroes, that passed unnoticed, just for (here we go again) the greater good! I expected more from the joker and less from the movie... at the end, I was amazed! The dark knight has the perfect measure, so every character is great and amazing! Don't get me wrong, I loved the joker, but with all the viral marketing WB released before the movie, I thought they would give more relevance to the joker than Batman or the movie itself, but gladly, they didn't.What I loved the most? Above all, the script. It's great. The acting, the cinematography, the music, the direction... Everything! I'm not saying this movie is perfect, but how can we, humans after all, describe perfection? Art is subjective, so for me, The Dark Knight is Perfect!"
7311,True,"First of all, I'm not a big fan of Batman, I like comics and all of that but I prefer Marvel, in any case I went to see this movie, the only thing that made me go was my anxiety to see Heath Ledger performance, but when I saw it, it left me speechless, not only the acting but the sequence and action is great. I've already seen this movie 3 times, and I'm still not bored of it. Well I have to agree with some people in something.. and it's about Two-Face, I mean, Eckhart did a great job playing Dent and Two-Face, but it wasn't really necessary having him in this movie, maybe in the next Batman, but not in this one. Other than that it's really a masterpiece, worth watching, and it will be worth buying. I loved Bale's acting, when I watch the first one I liked his acting, but now I'm sure he is Batman. Now Ledger, how can I not talk about his performance if that was the main reason I watch it?, his performance was scary and great, he really portrait THE Joker, and if he wins an Oscar it won't be because of some sentimental thing because of his death, it'll be because of his great acting.I don't really have much to say, I'm still speechless, but If you haven't seen it yet, you should watch it.(oh and for those who says that this is just another hero movie, another superhero movie, well for your information BATMAN is a HERO, it can't be an animal movie or a documentary, so call down, don't like it.. that's fine but think better.)"
7312,True,"They're back again! I think everyone had high expectations for this film, but this sequel went above and beyond. ""The Dark Knight"" was without a doubt the best movie of the year! In a word- riveting! It was equally as good as the first if not better. All of the action and suspense keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film, from the first scene to the last. It's one you have to see more than once, especially with such an all star cast. As always, Christian Bale plays yet another phenomenal role this second time around as Batman and Heath Ledger's last chilling, yet brilliant performance as ""The Joker"" both made the film. He most definitely deserves the Oscar! However, I did not care too much for Maggie Gyllenhaal as the new Rachel Dawes. There was just no chemistry there whatsoever. And you kind of feel bad for Batman too at the end because first the woman he loves chooses someone else after she already basically said that she loved him and then the entire city of Gotham turns on him, forcing him to become ""The Dark Knight."" The film also brought to light so many of the truths about the never ending battle of good vs. evil that so many fight within themselves. All in all, it demanded your full attention and rightly so. No doubt there will be another ""Batman"" somewhere in the near future, making it a trilogy that will soar through the box office once again. Entertainment at its best!"
7313,True,"Think of Raiders of the Lost Ark, Gladiator, Armageddon, The Fugitive. And then there was one. The Dark Knight, easily the best movie in years, and quite possibly the best sequel ever made (sorry Empire Strikes Back), may be the first superhero movie to win Best Picture. You've read the accolades. Heath Ledger's demon-comic Joker has outshone filmdom's most frightening antagonists, from the mesmerizing and insane Jack Nicholson in The Shining (hey, wasn't he the Joker in Tim Burton's Batman?) to Anthony Hopkins' insidious, and hungry, Hannibal Lechter in The Silence of the Lambs. The Dark Knight's rating is PG-13, yet Ledger nevertheless one ups all other film villains by possessing a calculated, sneering and twisted soul whose heartless acts of manic aggression could even frighten Darth Vader. Witness 1/ the film's opening bank heist double cross and the Joker's Nitzschean misquote, when he places a grenade in the foolhardy and overzealous bank manager's mouth, telling him, ""that whatever doesn't kill you, simply makes you STRANGER"" (this immediately establishes the Joker's morbid and memorable insanity), 2/ the Joker's own horrific recollection to others of how he received his scars and the carving up of a gang leader, 3/ the planning of Rachael Dawe's untimely death and the birth of Two Face (Aaron Eckhart you were terrific too), and 4/ his disregard for greed and money (who else would burn his share of the stolen millions, then boldly state, ""This city deserves a new breed of criminal, and I'm going to give it to 'em.""). There's also the ultra bleak dystopia created by the brilliant Christopher Nolan. Not since Blade Runner has civilization seemed so dark and helpless. Where Blade Runner portrays the future as a destitute and empty society, Nolan places the Dark Knight's blackness in the heart of US. This present, and our Heart of Darkness, is a Gotham City so recognizable in its corruption that it strikes a raw nerve in every film viewer. The Dark Knight is indeed a dark movie, but sociologically and ideologically real to the bone. This Batman movie brings out issues that we see in the news daily: terrorism, unrelenting crime, cyberspace hijacking, even villainy in the best of us: does Batman give in to his emotions and pound The Joker to a pulp? Or does he become the sacrificial lamb of Gotham, the Savior that we deserve, and one who carries on his shoulders the sins of all our actions? In the end, both Commissioner Gordon and The Dark Knight realize they must preserve the dignity of the law and continue the good name of Harvey Dent. Batman not only races off with his sorrows, but also with the brunt of Gotham's problems on his shoulders, and his hidden identity of ultimate sacrifice. The greater good must be restored, and Batman knows this.That's why The Dark Knight is the ultimate blockbuster, the ultimate superhero movie, and the ultimate cinematic masterpiece that it will be cherished as. For its taut action, thought provoking moral drama, superb visual effects, pulse-pounding musical soundtrack and flawless direction, it rates an 11 out of 10. The Dark Knight is Cinema Art, and it will be Movie of the Year."
7314,True,"This movie is so bloody overrated,it's ridiculous!Never have I experienced such mass hysteria in movie criticism before! OK, Ledger's performance was very good but not enough for an Oscar and certainly not enough to hold the movie together!It was a typical maniacal performance; nothing more or less!But nothing extraordinary that you haven't seen a lot of times before in similar characters! The movie itself was a disjointed mess,chaotic,schizophrenic editing... By the time it got to the last half hour,with the Sonar system that Batman used I was nauseating with its editing speed and no time for thinking! Poor movie;Batman Begins was much better..."
7315,True,"Being a Dark Knight fan of the comics for many decades, Batman in its true format, was NOT a comedy or a representation of anything that came out prior to Batman Returns. The TV sitcom was a joke. Tim Burton missed the context of Batman in its entirety. Finally, Christopher Nolan brings out the true essence of Batman, and its a wonder how so many people miss the context of what Batman represents. Even the vast majority of professional critics missed the true meaning of Batman.There is a much deeper, allegorical meaning about Batman itself that has been perfectly recreated in The Dark Knight that makes this movie surpass any movie ever created. The Dark Knight is a work of true ingeniousness, far more complex, contemporary, poignant and relevant than any movie ever made. If you miss what its trying to say, then you are left without any ability to understand why people are raving about this movie. But that's precisely the point. Too many people have forgotten how to think.Do you believe that Gotham City represents a fictional city? Do you believe that Batman and the Joker are based upon fictional characters? Then you missed the meaning behind Batman.The Dark Knight is a true work of genius. Its the complete war of two diametrically opposite ideas that work in our system of western culture and its extension to other concepts as well. Its a war between liberalism and conservatism. Its NOT only a war between good and evil that most people think. Not by a long shot. Gotham City represents the disease of liberalism gone amok. The fact that liberalism is guilty of graying out the dividing borders between good and evil has been fully established within our own societies. Look at our legal system! The guilty are treated far better than the victims. We have made the perpetrator the victim and the victim the guilty within the system of law. What is good becomes bad, what is bad becomes good. This is what Gotham City represents.Batman represents the conservative position to hold to what is right no matter what, and the Joker represents the conservative position of holding on to what is evil to the maximum. Its true that the statement there is a fine line between a genius and madness applies within The Dark Knight. Now lets take a good look at parts of the movie.During the robbery, we know that the Joker has no allies, he has his own agenda and doesn't have a conscience whatsoever. This fact is also represented by the ""pencil trick"" where his actions to himself was nothing more than a simple act that meant absolutely nothing to him. The Joker is immune to death or remorse. He plays by his own rules of madness, but is in perfect control of his extraordinary intelligence. What delights the Joker more than anything is to create sadistic moral dilemmas for everyone, criminal or not. To the Joker, Batman is the complete antithesis of who he is, but so much alike in determination to stand separate from apathy towards right and wrong.In the scene where Harvey Dent goes before the crowd and the crowd wants Batman to reveal himself because of the moral dilemma that the Joker created to weaken Batman's resolve, the crowd cries out for the Batman to succumb to the Joker's demands. This is pure liberalism at its best. Personally I believe its a disease of the mind. The inability to think rationally. We find this in our country where people cry out to stop the war that's going on in our world. Pure madness. How so you may ask? In the Joker's context, its so easy to see. Why? You can clearly see that he is a madman of epic proportions so you understand WHO the Joker is and what he represents. Know your enemy. The vast majority of people don't have a clue what the enemies true intension's are in this world. People refuse to see and believe that different mind sets exist within our world and how to understand them. Its there for people to see, but they don't see.In the movie, someone wants to save others by revealing who Batman is, but who defends the secrecy of Batman? The Joker. The Joker isn't interested in who Batman is at all. It was all about breaking Batman's resolve and using the public to revolt against him. Its absolute brilliance!You think two face has gone mad? Think about it. Use your brains! Harvey Dent stood for the conservative position that defied Gotham City completely. He stood for what is right. Absolutely. He understood that if his position was compromised, the legal system would be so corrupt that the flip of a coin exceeded the values of justice more than the liberal legal system that prevailed. Fifty-fifty odds were better than anything available. How true is this today in our world.Batman stands as enigma towards our world today. If you stand up for what is right and fight for it, you are condemned by the very people you protect. If you do nothing to prevent evil from spreading, like liberalism is guilty of, then you become weak and useless to stand against the tide of evil that is certain to overwhelm this world.I loved the ferry scene. Think about it. If you knew anything about the Joker, you would have realized that each boat had detonators, but being consistent to the Joker's mindset, each boat would have had the detonator that would have blown up their own boats, not the other. Its remarkable that no one clued in to this. I guess I know the Joker better than others.This only touches the surface of how deep The Dark Knight goes. Its far deeper and meaningful than any other movie ever created.It takes brains to understand Batman. Use it."
7316,True,"The last movie I commented on (luck made it so that it also was an action movie), was Wanted. My remark on that movie was that 'if you have to give an action movie a plot, please make it so that it's worth it'. And here we are, the Dark Knight. I could write about this film for hours and hours and hours. Dethroning my personal favorite (the good, the bad and the ugly) from my top-10 list, TDK offers something to all movie fans to enjoy.To the action-movie fan: Restrained yet beautifully done action scenes. No exaggerations, no cars flying into trains. No need for pointlessly placed excessive stunt men. Just the right number of it all served within the movie's theme and as part of the plot instead of the usual action film approach which is ""let's put some beat'em up scenes in so that the people'll hopefully forget about the shallow story we're offering them"" To the movie-plot fan : A movie that offers up a solid storyline. Used before in other films yet never to this extend. Each and every character are tied to the plot and contributing in their own manner. This is not a railroading storyline that you know its ending from scratch. This is a mad roller-coaster ride that even though you have a hunch it won't have a happy ending, you take it fully to its destination.To the acting-performance fan: I am not as eloquent as other people who've praised performances in this movie. From Mr.Ledger, to Mr.Caine, all I can say is they've done the best impersonation I've seen. Of good, evil, chaos, law, and the eternal struggle. An extra word for Mr.Ledger as he remains the most solid evil character impersonation that I've seen on the big screen ever.To the movie-soundtrack fan: The perfect score for a chaotic film such as this. It ties, it sticks in your mind, it makes you hum it as you walk down the street and as you do hum it the entire film goes through your eyes again and again and again.To movie-direction fan: Anything I say or put here will be pointless. Photography, colors, scenery, dialogs, scenes and the prequel tying to the sequel. Watch it for yourselves and see. 10/10 out of me.To the Batman fan: The Nolan brothers do this for more than just money, I can assure you. They love their work, they love putting their ideas to paper. And they respect the symbol that one of the world's greatest superheroes is. Not only that, but they also respect the villains and the entire world of Gotham. This project couldn't be in better hands.As an epilogue, I'd like to state two things.First a big thank you to everyone who brought us this movie in a period where Hollywood mostly makes us bang our heads on the wall and wish we were blind. I am not sure if there should or should not be a sequel what with Mr.Ledger's tragedy. But I am sure the Nolan brothers will make the right choice. If the sequel (if there is one) is not directed by them, I will surely not sit and watch it.Second to any directors out there or to anyone from the Hollywood movie industry that might take the time to read this (even though my hopes are not so strong on it :). Watch and learn. Watch and realize what an action film that respects its genre should be like. It takes more time to make than a future DVD-trash like Wanted that only gets some glamor due to the strong acting names involved in it. But the end result will still fill your pockets with good cash. And will keep the people that go out for a lovely movie weekend satisfied and happy. To the point that they might say : That was 10 bucks well spent, let's go again next weekend.I know I have and will do so again."
7317,True,"I've seen this movie the day after it's release in theaters in the US. I have to say that it's one of the best movie ever. Though like many others would say that it's as good as Godfather. I can't really say since I've never seen that movie and probably never will. But the most thing that caught my attention the most is Heath Ledger's performance as the menacing Joker. I have to admit, Joker is one of my favorite comic book villains of all time, and Ledger nailed it. Sadly he's not here to see how big of a success this became, but I bet he would be appreciable about his accomplishment. Though I came to found out that Ledger was in two other movies that I really like (""10 Things I Hate About You"" and ""The Brothers Grimm""). I never knew the actor's name in both films until I realize it after seeing ""The Dark Knight"". Yeah, I felt stupid, but can't help it if I have bad memory sometimes.Though enough of Ledger's excellent work in this movie. There was other things in this movie that I really loved. Two-Face was awesome. Especially the actor, Aaron Eckhart, was really great for the role. It was like he was born to play as Two-Face (Same for Ledger as the Joker). I actually thought Two-Face would be a cliffhanger to the third movie. I guess not. It was a great ending for the movie to end it as Harvey the hero and Batman on the run from the law for the choice he made (I hope that made sense). Brilliant. Just pure brilliant.Commissioner Gordon, as always, is my favorite supporting character from the Batman comics. Gary Oldman was great for the role, and just because I never like the guy who portrayed Gordon from the Burton/Schumacher movies (Blah! He was a good actor but I didn't see him as James Gordon). And I actually thought Gordon was killed, but he came back and shows Joker who's boss.Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, sticking true to the comics perfectly and the character was explore excellently too. And Freeman is a very talented guy and did a really great job at his role.Maggie Gyllenhaal was better then Katie Holmes. I don't care what you are all complaining about, Maggie is great for the role. Just I wish Rachel's death came unexpected (Internet sucks sometimes, that's all I can say).Sir Michael Caine from my favorite movies he starred (""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"", ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"", ""Batman Begins"", and of course ""The Dark Knight"") is a great talent as well. He serves us was a really good performance of Alfred (Michael Gough is still my favorite portrayal of Alfred from the original Batman series).Last but not least, the main character, our favorite Dark Knight caped crusader, BATMAN! He's also known as Christian Bale. All I have to say about what he did for this movie is...well, what can I say? He is the Batman, he was perfect with the role from start to finish.I like to say that Heath Ledger wasn't certainly playing the Joker. He IS the Joker. I know a lot of you say that, but it's the truth.So overall the characters, actors, plot, and director did a great job. Nicely done.So hopefully I will see this movie in theaters again. It was the greatest movie experience in my life as a filmmaker, and forever will be remembered. I just wish my cousin and her boyfriend wasn't there making out. Only kidding though. I wasn't anywhere near them while watching the movie. :P I rate ""The Dark Knight"", 10 out of 10 stars!"
7318,True,"And I thought Batman Begins was the best. It is rare that a sequel or follow up movie is better than its predecessor. But Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale have pulled it off. I've never before attended a midnight sneak showing of a movie, but when I read that it was an anticipated sellout, I decided not to wait until opening day. Good thing too. The Dark Knight is a true masterpiece. It is not only the best comic book adapted movie. It is not only the best crime drama movie. It is not only the best psychodrama movie. It is not only the best Batman movie. IT IS ALL THESE CATEGORIES ALTOGETHER!! I am personally convinced that the Dark Knight surpasses any comic book movie ever made in its history. The entire cast gave stand alone performances in their perspective roles. The cinematography was superb and you can't beat the musical score composed by the same two geniuses who scored Batman Begins. Unlike the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher movies, Gotham City looks like a real city, especially since they filmed in Chicago. Burton's Gotham looked too dark Beetejuice Edward Scissorhands fantasy and Schumacher's Gotham looked too neon gay. Gotham City needs to look real and not like some fantasy set and Nolan pulled it off! Christian Bale really pulls off both sides of the cowl as Batman and Bruce Wayne. It's great to see Michael Caine, Gary Oldsman, and Morgan Freeman back in their roles as Alfred, Gordon, and Lucius Fox. The best casting choice they made was casting Maggie Gyllenhal as Rachel Dawes since I felt she was more believable in the role than Katie Holmes ever was. When I saw Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, I realized that I saw him in a movie called Thank You for Smoking. The studio did wise not to reveal his appearance as Two Face. As to how, when, and where it happens, you will just have to see the movie for yourself. Thank you WB for keeping the secret guarded. But Eckhart really executes the role of the White Knight who eventually falls. Now saving the best for last. The late great Heath Ledger. While I was not really familiar with his work, he really and truly stole the show as the Joker and he did it without upstaging Batman like what happened in the Keaton/Nicholson movie. Ledger really vanished into the role of the Joker. He literally lived and breathed the part and his Joker is more of a frightening, terrorizing menace than any of the past incarnations. And he lives by no rules whatsoever. Now don't get me wrong. Caesar Romero will be remembered for the camp version, Jack Nicholson has the best Joker look and played the comical killer and Mark Hammill gave the best standout performance as the voice of the Joker in Batman: The Animated Series. But Heath Ledger's Joker will make you either forget the other versions or at least make you put the others on the back burner. In my personal opinion, Heath Ledger truly deserves the honor of a posthumous Oscar Nomination. Whether or not there is a third Batman movie done by Nolan and Bale is neutral for me. I would certainly enjoy it and I hope it eventually happens, but at the same time, I feel this is the best and I would hate to see a lesser quality movie to follow this one. Any future Batman movies, whether they bring in Robin, The Penguin, Catwoman, or any number of other villains, other heroes or supportive players should be done by another director and starring actor who will continue the franchise in the Nolan/Bale style. While I love both Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk both, I am convinced the Dark Knight is bar none THE BEST SUPER HERO MOVIE OF 2008 IF NOT EVER MADE!!! Perfect!! Two Thumbs Up!!!"
7319,True,"The opening moments set in motion everything you need to know about a villain: amidst a bank heist each criminal takes his turn to blow away a fellow criminal until there are just two left, the idea being that their share of the loot grows with each death. At this point the Joker reveals himself to be one of the last two and promptly kills off the final thug leaving the money all to himself; the grenade he leaves behind as a thank you only emphasises the evilness of the deed as the Joker calmly drives a school bus full of money into a stream of other school buses to complete his getaway. Not since Darth Vader strolled powerfully onto the screen in 1977 has a shadow character been so menacing, and the audience knows that Batman is going to be given a torrid time in dealing with an enemy that proves to be a force of nature.If that wasn't enough then on the other side of Batman is the White Knight: Harvey Dent who as Gotham City's District Attorney seems to finally be cleaning up on the shadow world. If the Joker is a chaotic trickster character then Harvey Dent is the epitome of the truth and righteousness, a true hero. So in spite of the Joker's presence Bruce Wayne starts to consider whether he needs to continue as Batman and even envisages a day when Gotham doesn't need him anymore; naturally this dream is complicated by the fact that his long term love Rachel Dawes is Harvey's girl at the time, but never the less Bruce is really taken with Dent's ideals which after all hold the possibility of his own redemption/reward.So into this arena steps the Batman and I can safely say every event that follows draws emotion and inspiration then turns them into horror. I think for the first time we see why the Joker was created originally, twisting the laws of logic into a grotesque and anarchic vision of how he believes the world should be.For me when a character is so well defined and then translated onto screen the best part of what you get out of their performance is connection and questions; questions about your own morality and how we choose to live our lives. In my opinion these questions are most apt when coming from a good villain, after all the evil in them is the repression that haunts us all. The problems they create and things they destroy lead ultimately to an affirmation of the hero's ideals and help him to define what his role is with greater conviction. In this the Dark Knight delivers it all and has left me running back over and over it in my mind since last night.This is an outstanding piece of work from Christopher Nolan and his brother and I don't say that lightly because the last time I was this affected was after the first Lord of the Rings film back in 2001. Make no mistake this is not a kids film by any stretch of the imagination and my advice to parents is to seriously consider not taking anyone under twelve as the subject matter requires more maturity; that said this is a movie of wit and guile that will fully deserve multiple awards next year."
7320,True,"The hype over The Dark Knight reached preposterous planes before the midnight release, and I won't lie: I scoffed at the Oscar buzz. The Academy would never dismount their high horse and reward a ""Batman"" or a ""comic book"" film.Now I believe. I believe in Harvey Dent, and I believe Nolan created a tour de force worthy of Best Picture. If the film had been directed by Scorsese, it would be in a sure in (or maybe not, you know, took him only twenty years to get the damn thing). Nolan created a modern Greek Tragedy.Tragedy is the downfall of a great man caused by either the Gods or by hamarita (a tragic misstep). Harvey Dent was a great man, the ""White Knight"" to Batman's ""Dark""  and The Joker, a self-described agent of chaos, swoops into Gotham like an angry messenger from the Gods.Did you feel the fear and pity? I did. And I felt it for every character  most of all, I felt disturbed. Watching the Batman beat The Joker in the holding cell is probably the most haunting scene in the film. I almost could not watch it.I've seen the film three times. Its elegance only grows on me, right down to Aaron Eckhart's cleft chin. Not only is Aaron just as good as Heath  if not better  the casting director selected a man whose face visually splits in half, even before the transformation.I cannot speak highly enough of Gary Oldman, as the supreme Jim Gordon. Oldman brings all the sentiment without sentimentalism, all the fragility without weakness, and all the humanity without melodrama to our beloved commissioner.As for Batman becoming a secondary figure to the villains, I say reread your source material. Batman is an elusive figure that not even members of the Bat Family understand. Here Bale plays Bats as the detective on the trail, and Wayne struggling with his choice to become The Batman. It's a quiet performance, and full of the grace.The convict on the boat steals the film. His actions in the time of crisis live with you long after the credits roll. He is the essence of the film: brief rays of dawn over coming the darkness. For anyone that calls this film too dark, too depressing, too sadistic, and too nihilistic, I say look again. If it wasn't Batman, I'd said it believed in Truth, Justice, and the American Way. Just a 21st Century version.(The only problem I had with the film: why Jim Jr instead of Babs at the end? Why!)"
7321,True,"Where do I begin? The film was hyped ever since reviews started filtering out about Heath Ledger's final performance. The film, as well as his performance, has been lauded. I was slightly skeptical, but still highly anticipating film and my expectations were very high. Well they were met and exceeded. I have to agree with those reviews comparing it to The Empire Strikes Back. It is that equivalent to the superhero genre. The overtones are darker than Batman Begins, which was a great stepping-stone for this incredible and epic storytelling of two masterful nemeses for Batman, The Joker and Two-Face. However, the film did not get lost in the dark and still holds a great sense of humor to alleviate much of the pain of the film.To begin with, Batman is having troubles carrying over from the first film. The narrows was lost and he is still trying to collect the criminals who escaped including Scarecrow / Jonathan Crane in small cameo appearance, which really was only weak point of the film. For a villain given so much story time in the first film, it felt disappointing to see him carelessly tossed aside here as he was at the end of Begins. I digress on that, matter though as it is overall a minor disappointment. As he is finishing business with Scarecrow it also shown, that Batman has inspired others to follow him in his ""vigilante"" activities. He is not pleased at this. It is not what he intended when he donned the mask. However, the vigilantes inspired by him are not the real beef.The Joker and first the mob is the first beef. Batman and Lieutenant James Gordon are cracking down on the mob hard forcing them to launder their money to one man. Pounding them into a corner, this proves most deadly for a city already having major problems. Into this deadly net waltz the ultimate in chaos theory. The Joker, a mad hatter and the anti-thesis of Batman, who not only follows not rules, but also has no qualms about doing what Batman will not, kill and kill without remorse. He is a mad man and sadistic and still one the enigma he is from the comics, something that Jack Nicholson had ruined for him back in 1989. Unlike him, Heath Ledger is aloud to play the role savagely and therefore, cannot be compared to Nicholson's lighter Joker. He is unto a class all his own in the Batman universe. Anarchy and madness that is what Ledger plays Joker as and deftly too, as advertised a complete screwball whose actions have no rhythm and no bounds. He is the showman of the film, but overblown. Still one cannot help but laugh with him as the film goes up to the point when he kills.While Joker plays the villain of the film, the film offers three main lead heroes whom through the course of the film are tested to their limits by the Joker bound by none. There is the incorruptible Batman, the stalwart James Gordon, and the newcomer District Attorney Harvey Dent. All played just as well as Ledger's Joker making the film are a fantastic film to watch as the four men butt heads. Individually they do it with the Joker as well as together. It is the heart and soul of the film. The three heroes most especially Harvey Dent represent the goodness of Gotham. That is something that is tried to the edge by the Joker. It is through the performances of Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, and Aaron Eckhart that the film flourishes dramatically.Extraneously on the side, there is the love triangle between Bruce Wayne, Rachel Dawes, and Harvey Dent, but only alongside the main one of the heart of the city and the triangle of Batman, Gordon, and Dent. Above all Gotham is what must survive and that is what Joker makes at stake as much as Ra's al Ghul did in Begins. Therefore, the love story takes a back seat, but it is not overlooked in the 2 hours and 40 minutes that the film runs. It covers a lot of ground with lots of twists and turns and it does not miss a beat and way to tie up a loose end, save for Cillian Murphy's ever suffering Scarecrow.The technical makeup of the film is equally as stunning as the film story and makes it astounding strong in all respects. Add to that the perfect melding of countless comics and portrayals in the performances here and the film falls into place as the pinnacle the Batman film series has to offer to date."
7322,True,"Bleh. I thought 'Batman Begins' was all right. Not particularly good, but a nice way to waste a few hours. This one just outright sucks. After being hyped to death (pun not intended) between everything such as Heath Ledger's death and whatnot, I begrudgingly went to see this film. What a mess.Heath Ledger was a good actor. He did good with what he had. Unfortunately, he didn't have much here. The Joker looks absolutely horrible. The premise of creating a ""realistic"" superhero flick is outright idiotic. Superheroes were never made to be realistic. They were created for young comic book readers to escape the hardships of the real world and delve into a world of fantasy and mystique. Removing that fantasy and mystique turns it into a soap opera with masks. Basically, all we've got here are politically-fueled undertones. Yadda, yadda, yadda, Joker is represented as the terrorist threat to America, throw in some scenes of the destruction looking like 9/11 and have Batman confiscate the security of the people like President Bush and his Patriot Act. How juvenile and disgusting.So, if you life watching Heath Ledger look like a hobo wearing clown make-up, seeing Christian Bale talk like he's faking a cold, hearing Gary Oldman scream with a British accent as an American lieutenant/commissioner, and seeing Aaron Eckhart with a half-CGI head then this is the film for you! Unfortunately, millions have already flocked to it and claimed it is the greatest piece of celluloid to be projected on a screen since the concept of the movie. Shame on them.Also, Heath Ledger for a posthumous Academy Award for playing the Joker? Give me a break. You'd have better luck of Disaster Movie winning best comedy."
7323,True,"The only thing that I know about Batman is that he's a man that dresses in a black bat suit. As such, I had no clue about what happened during the movie. The good first:1. I liked all of the action sequences (which is basically 80% of the movie) 2. I loved how the joker and his clowns really freak you out.Now, the bad: 1. I really didn't get how everything fit together. I don't see how a bank robbery, a Hong Kong businessman, a multimillionaire, a psycho clown, a detective, Harvey Dent/two-face, 2 boats, a lot of explosives, and 800 people can fit into one single story. 2. The batman's motives seem really murky. Why does he want to beat up criminals at night?For the really big batman fan, this'll be great. For me though, this was only a mediocre film, because I JUST DIDN'T GET IT!"
7324,True,"If there is anyone who is an anti-Batman fan, it would be me. While I thought Batman Begins was one of the best of 2005, I did not care all that much for the first four Batman films. I actually despised Batman Returns to the point that it is entrenched firmly on my top 50 worst films of all time. With that in mind, I began hearing all of the accolades this film was getting before it's release. How Heath Ledger had turned in a performance of a lifetime. How this was being called the Godfather of Comic Book films. How this film was being lauded as one of the best films in the last ten years and so on. By now, you've heard them all. And to be honest, I resented that and I believed that it was simply the scope of Heath's death that was causing this love fest with The Dark Knight. Never have I been so glad to be wrong. Not only is this film the best film I have seen since American Beauty, it is one that moved me and reminded me why I fell in love with the art of film in the first place. Christopher Nolan and Heath Ledger and everyone involved should be proud that this film transcends comic book films, and it transcends the summer popcorn genre. It is a larger than life experience and it is one of the best films ever made, in my opinion.As we all remember, the end of Batman Begins we were shown a new villain named the Joker that had been leaving his card at the scene of his crimes. This takes place shortly after that with the Joker and his henchmen robbing a bank that holds mob money. He steals a cool 68 million dollars in a well executed and highly improbable robbery. Soon he is crashing a mob meeting and introduces himself quite effectively with a disappearing pencil trick that gets everyone's attention. His thought process is that he knows the mob no longer has the respect they once did, and that is because of the Batman. He offers his services, to kill the Batman, but with a hefty price. When his prediction comes true later in the film, that the mobsters are not safe from Batman, they realize they do need him. Meanwhile, a new DA named Harvey Dent is keen on cleaning up the city in any way possible. When he realizes that Batman is actually good for the city, Bruce Wayne takes a liking to him and decides that Harvey will be his white knight. This may actually allow Bruce to live a normal life. But of course nothing goes as planned and when tragedy strikes Harvey and his loved one, all hell breaks loose in Gotham City and the Joker becomes more and more unstoppable. Soon of course we are headed down the inevitable mano a mano confrontation between Batman and The Joker, but in a way that has never been done before.The Dark Knight explores socio-political issues usually reserved for a Michael Mann film. Take one exchange between the Joker and Batman, on paper it sounds good, but to see it on screen is mesmerizing: ""Don't talk like one of them. You're not, even if you'd like to be. They need you right now. But when they don't, they'll cast you out...LIKE A LEPER. See their morals, their code...it's a bad joke...dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show ya, when the chips are down, these civilized people will EAT each other."" Batman and The Joker are separated by a fine line. But that line is often crossed in the film and when the Joker puts Batman to the test, I think they switch personalities. The film works because it has iconic characters and wonderful performances no doubt, but it also works brilliantly because it treats the audience like they are smart and perceptive. Spiderman 3 this is not.It has to be mentioned of course that Heath Ledger gives a performance that has no equal. When I think of some of the great performances in film, I think of Kevin Spacey in American Beauty, Val Kilmer in Tombstone, Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood and Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, just to name a few. They have nothing on Heath. He is The Joker. You won't recognize him, you won't know that it is an actor, you will believe that there is a man named the Joker that is on screen and someone captured him on film. There is not a finer performance I can think of and if anyone wins best supporting actor this year besides him, it is their duty to thank the academy and then decline the award and give it to Heath. He is that good. The Joker is mesmerizing.The Dark Knight is a film for a generation of film lovers that has been begging for a better comic book film. This is that film. Even if you are not a big fan of these type of movies, it will win you over.10/10"
7325,True,"***This comment DEFINITELY contains spoilers. :-)***Okay, let's get the good stuff out of the way, because it won't take long. The acting is good, and the movie is probably worth seeing just for the Heath Ledger role. Most of the rest of the cast does a fine job as well, with the exception of Maggie Gyllenhaal who was pretty flat and lifeless.And the rest of the movie...bad. I'll try to stick with the high...er, lowlights.Action: the chase scenes and most of the action scenes in general were chaotic to the point that you couldn't really follow them. ""Somebody shot something at someone, but someone else maybe interfered somehow so the outcome is unclear and can prolong the scene but we're not sure how or why. But stuff blew up, so it must be cool!"" The biggest issue is plausibility: apparently the Joker (who doesn't make a single joke, BTW) can roll 1000's of 55 gallon drums of gunpowder and/or gasoline all of the city, including the police station and hospitals without anyone noticing.Per Rachael Dawes, ""The safest place is Bruce Wayne's penthouse."" Apparently, she has short term memory issues, because the Joker and crew just waltzed in there the day before. That's right, he can walk thru any security perimeter without the slightest issue. We are not given any reason why this is so or justification for it, he simply appears whenever and wherever the script calls for him no matter how ridiculous. Oh, did I mention he's invulnerable? That's right, he can blow stuff up so that everyone around him is dead or unconscious but there's not a scratch on him.Also, every boat captain carrying a prison population would take a popular vote with the convicts as to what to do with a detonator, right? This is just scratching the surface of issues with this movie, but hopefully it gets the point across. There are lots of other timing/continuity flaws, character inconsistencies, etc. to keep you entertained as well.It is generally against my policy to skew my vote to try and push a rating, but this movie doesn't belong in the top 100, let alone number one all time. I give it about 5/10."
7326,True,"The Dark Knight..Ledger and Chicago 10, Plot and Dialogue 4 The Dark Knight is the latest saga in the Chris Nolan/Christian Bale dynasty of Batman films. We return back to gotham city where the mob has taken ahold of the money in gotham city, but only operates during the day due to their fear of the Batman (Christian Bale). Enter the Joker (Heath Ledger) a card carrying pscho-killer who teams up with and is ready to lead the mafia back from the dead by wreaking havoc on the city and luring in the Batman in for the kill (or so we think). Meanwhile an election is on for the new D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) who is dating Bruce Waynes ex-girlfriend Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Wayne meanwhile follows Maggie around trying to up-stage Dent and Maggie with his affiliations with ritzy fundraisers, 3 girlfriends on his arm and at one point taking the Russian Ballet yachting just to cancel a performance that Dent and Maggie would be attending. All of this while a beautifully shot city of Chicago provides the backdrop for Gotham City. What proceeds from here are a number of twists and turns in the plot between the aforementioned characters as their ambitions are revealed on the screen. Bale plays Wayne cocky and overly arrogant. He plays Batman with a voice that is overly gruff, distracting and almost comical. Gyllenhaal is fine as Maggie, but under developed and lacks range which is more because of the character, rather than Gyllenhaal herself. Eckart plays Dent pretty straight but like many of the characters in this film underdeveloped (aside from one). This is the joker's ace. Ledger's character is the only character that is fully developed with a proper through line. His needs and wants are well defined without having to spoon feed the audience. Ledger communicates this brilliantly without taking it over the top. Spoiler Alert Overall likability and believability is the big problem here. Not a problem if this is Schumacher's Batman, but it ain't. This is Nolan's Batman in a more realistic setting. The characters are deep enough but the the twists in the plots come before they are around long enough for the audience to identify or care about them. Even Batman has to restate what he wanted Harvey Dent to be to gotham city about 3 or 4 times, just to remind the audience. This leads to another major problem with the film, Maggie's death and the transition from Harvey Dent to 2-Face. Not convincing enough of a transition. I doubt that the Joker, who killed Maggle could and would convince Dent to get revenge and start killing people all in one scene. It is a very week plot point and unconvincing. Also, what is up with the 2-Face make-up. it strikingly resembled the skeleton of the T-1000 from Terminator. For a Batman film that wants to be realistic...sorry...totally unrealistic! The infections in the exposed bones would not hold up. Also, he flips the coin too many times which prolongs the action in a non-suspenseful way.Other points include cheesy reaction dialogue from random cast member and a tye in-to national security that tries a little too hard to make a point. All is not lost on this adventure. The actions scenes are good, Batman/Joker chemistry is very good. This is a grossly overrated film that takes one step back from it's predecessor. The question remains, is Ledger's performance good enough to garner an Oscar nomination: yes. Should The Dark Knight garner an Oscar nomination, uh...no. Some critics have related this film to Heat and The Departed. Not even close."
7327,True,"Batman Begins rebooted the Batman series as a tale that's sadder and more violent than Tim Burton's or Joel Schumacher's films; such a radical change in style from the previous films (which emphasized a lot of Gothic settings and campy humor) could have been only done with a smart and talented director with lots of tricks under his sleeves; luckily, that director was found in British-born Christopher Nolan. It goes much deeper into Batman's past and origins, something that Burton only tried to do in Batman, and Schumacher didn't try at all. The Dark Knight, the sequel to Batman Begins, preserves Nolan's vision of Batman, however it adds numerous features that only improve the film.For one, it has brilliant actors. In Batman Begins, the biggest flaw was the actress who played Batman's love interest. This horrible actress was Katie Holmes. In The Dark Knight, that tiny mistake is rectified by replacing her with the more talented Maggie Gyllenhaal. There is also a fine addition of new cast members, including Aaron Eckhart as District Attorney Harvey Dent and Heath Ledger (in his last role before he died, may he rest in peace) as the Joker. Finally, the great veteran actors from Batman Begins stay for the sequel; these actors are Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Batman's armorer, Michael Caine as Bruce Wayne's butler and closest confidant, Alfred, Gary Oldman as Police Lieutenant James Gordon, and Christian Bale as Batman, also known as Bruce Wayne.When the film starts, the Joker, along with a group of henchmen, head out to a bank owned by the mob. They go to rob it, and in a weird turn of events, the Joker manipulates his minions into killing each other until only he is left, the sole survivor of the shootout.Meanwhile, Batman, with the assistance of Lieutenant Gordon as well as D.A. Harvey Dent, are planning to completely take out the mob. Though at first suspicious and jealous of Dent, especially since he's the man dating Rachel Dawes (Gyllenhaal), Bruce Wayne begins to form a friendship with the man after recognizing his honesty, even though he's still in love with Rachel himself. Wayne is tired of living his double life as Batman, and views Dent as Gotham's true hero and the heir apparent to take over Batman's position in the war on crime.On the other hand, the meddling of Batman, Gordon, and Dent is taking a big toll on the mob. They form a temporary truce on how to fix the problem before it turns uncontrollable. The Joker offers his services in return for half of the mob's money; though they initially refuse, they ultimately accept the Joker's deal.Just when victory's near for Batman and the law, the Joker arrives and makes a direct threat to Gotham: if Batman does not reveal himself to the public, people will die every day. As the body count escalates and more people turn on him, Batman pushes on, but the Joker's murderous spree slowly destroys his hope of a world without crime.Acting, good. Story, brilliant. But what is the key component of a good superhero film? Action sequences. And despite executing the first two aspects perfectly, the chase and fighting scenes are the highlight of the entire film. To name a few examples, take the truck flipping over, or the opening heist sequence, or (in my opinion the best fight scene in the film) the scene where Batman fights Russian mobsters, dogs, impostors of himself, and the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy in a cameo appearance).This is one of the greatest films of the decade, not to mention one of the best superhero films of all time. If you want to know why I like it so much, read this review. Again. Rated PG- 13. Four out of four stars."
7328,True,"** Spoilers It is very sad that this movie is in the top 10, Not much to say about it, series of short-length clips, with cool vs uncool characters. No surprises. No attachment to characters. Absurd endless dialogues. Drama queens all the way. This is just empty. The joker could never ever get the ability to put these things together if he didn't care about ""plans"". Oh I'll do a spoiler now that I'm at it. The batman survives. He is going to be hunted even when he didn't do anything wrong. So unfair. Movie illustrates that people (even criminals) are very good at the core, but there are crazy people like the joker in the world, so this movie is really useful to show us that. Oh, and Morgan Freeman can track phone calls of 30M ppl simultaneously. :D"
7329,True,"I watched the movie twice to see if my first reaction to the film is correct. The second watch confirmed it! It was awful. Christian Bale performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman was so cardboard. I'm a big Batman fan and what Christian Bale did to the character was a crime. The voice of Batman was just the beginning of the end for me. Here we are, we have the one of the worlds most greatest Detective and he couldn't figure out anything the Joker's hair brain schemes. Everyone died around this man. He saved no one! At least Michael Keaton's Batman gave Joker a run for his money(Joker:He stole my balloons!). But in this film, he made Batman completely incompetent.This movie should have been called the Joker's revenge, Because it was all about Heath Ledger in this movie. Heath Ledger did a great job. But it seems Christopher Nolan was so into his performance, he forgot about the rest of the cast.Fight scenes were laughable! anyone really in a suit like that and decided to fight crime would get they ass handed to them. Take notes from Blade!!!!!! Speaking of annoying casting, Maggie Gyllenhal was the most painful to watch. Her voice just pierced my soul like a piece of hot coal. Her trying to be sexy! LOL LOL LOL LOL! sorry i'm back! The Movie dragged! especially the last hour and a half of the film. Don't want to spoil anything, but the boat scene was drastically drawn & boring! The best part of the film was when it ended. I have no desire to see this film again.The bad part about this is I found others who felt the same way but so afraid to speak against this film like its the Holy Grail! Give me a break! So many better Superhero films. Spiderman 1 & 2, Blade 1 & 2 Xmen 2 Ironman Punisher Warzone & Incredible Hulk! was more true to the characters."
7330,True,"Overall, this Batman was merely an average movie. It was a mix of greatness and disappointment.What pulled it up was individual performances; particularly by Ledger. But also Oldman, Caine and Gyllenhaal were good.What pulled it down was the non-focused plot and the poorly executed transfigured character of Eckhart.Plot first: The Dark Knight is only a half-baked story about Batman. In fact, it's more about the Joker, the DA and the cop with Batman playing second violin. I could not identify or feel Batman's purpose in the Knight. It's like all the air went out of him since Batman Begins, which I think is a much better movie than Knight.Also Bale was not as good as he was in Batman Begins. Reason being that his the story surrounding his character was not well thought through. It's almost like they tried to stitch in his Batman character after they wrote the main story about the psycho Joker's mission to ""get the Batman"" and to turn good people into bad people.Well, the plot to ""get the Batman"" is simply to make Batman feel so guilty about all the carnage in Gotham that he decides to step down. ABC terrorism tactics. How novel. Please folks. They could have done so much better with the story line.The second mission, to turn good people into bad people, I mean, OK but why is the Joker doing this? There's a disconnect here. The story is not built up. There's no context. Only little is told about the Joker's apparently traumatic past.Now Eckhart: Eckhart's transition from DA to vigilante was so not convincing. I never felt a real love connection between him and Gyllenhaal. There was no spark between the two on screen. They were like oil and water and the storyline never supported Eckhart's apparently insanely deep love for Gyllenhaal. Secondly, Eckhart simply sucked at playing a mean psycho character. He's too cute and lovable for such a role.The flipping of the coin thingy was downright lame. Particularly when one compares to the identical ""method"" of deciding another persons fate as masterfully executed by Bardem in No Country For Old Men.The makeup of the burnt side of Eckhart's face was also poorly done; like it was done in 1980.I also could not identify with Batman's mission in this movie. I had no trouble in Batman Begins, which in my opinion is much better than the Dark Knight.In summary, the Knight lacks story line and context. Ledger is great, but halfway through the movie his character grows old. The movie relies too much on the Joker to carry the story line. The main plots to ""get the Batman"" and turn people bad are both lame and lack story build up to be convincing."
7331,True,"This movie has toppled all the records and currently ranked number 1 on IMDb rankings. This really makes me doubt about how IMDb ranking works and are we the people so gullible to the advertisement campaigns that we have rated this film this high.... I must say this that the film as such is not bad. It is the best film so far this year. However it does not qualify to even come near to other masterpieces. If it is not for Heath Ledger's excellent performance, I would have rated this film even lower. To tell the truth I liked the prequel of this film better. The film is lengthy and melodramatic. e.g. the scene where inmates and civilians want to decide if they want to blow off other ship. Message was good but the way it was delivered is little bit childish. Also, transformation of Harvey Dent seems sudden and illogical. Nolan should have developed this character better. If Harvey does what he does after the death of his beloved, he should be avenging Joker. The most important part where joker convinces him to be an anarchist just like him is written poorly. All in all, it is a good movie (excuse me but far from masterpiece)."
7332,True,"This is the first Batman movie that's not about Batman. It's no traditional yarn about a protagonist fighting a villain, with audiences hoping the hero beats the bad guy. On the contrary, it's a thrilling story about the cost of heroism and seduction by evil.Tim Burton explored anti-hero themes with Michelle Pfeiffer's brooding Catwoman in ""Batman Returns,"" and although Burton failed to flesh it out, many people agree Catwoman was the best part of that film. Director Christopher Nolan knows better, having demonstrated a Hitchcockian mastery of psychology with themes of guilt (Insomnia) and competition (The Prestige). In his film, we meet Joker (a chilling Heath Ledger), a sociopath with a taste for anarchy. He doesn't want revenge or power. In one scene, he burns a mountain of cash. The mobsters call him crazy, and before he cuts them to pieces he mutters ""It's not about money. It's about sending a message."" Right away, we know he isn't a villain we can predict or understand. Consequently, he's pretty terrifying.Ledger's Joker is so compelling that he has the best lines and the most memorable scenes. Usually we watch superhero films to see how the protagonist overcomes the villain. But in ""The Dark Knight,"" we strangely cheer as the Joker kicks ass at robbing banks, manipulating the mob, and even destroying a hospital. Strangely enough, we walk away from the experience not wanting to be Batman. We want to be Joker.But that's not what I mean when I say this movie isn't about Batman. It's actually about DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart, whose strong performance will be overshadowed by Ledger's). He is Gotham's White Knight, and his tragedy revolves around an anecdote told early in the film about the Roman who guards his city not out of power lust, but of civic duty-- to which his girlfriend and Assistant DA Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) wisely refutes, ""Don't forget, the last man given that duty was named Caesar."" Here lies the central theme-- a man holds power until death or long enough to see himself become the villain.It's deep stuff for a Batman movie, but it works extremely well. Many may leave the film wondering why, but it has to do with what we missed from ""Star Wars Episode III."" Although we're horrified by Joker's mind (whose villainy rivals Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter), we can't help but be strangely drawn to his eerie confidence, manic charisma and unstoppable power. Due to some grueling and unexpected events, Dent falls from grace and becomes seduced by Joker's evil.Let's not forget Batman, who is common-denominator (but not centerpiece) to the war between Dent and Joker. Dent proclaims Batman as Gotham's hero, but others don't agree-- including Bruce Wayne. Wayne is still a jealous, self-absorbed, and emotionally tortured brat in many ways, as we learned from ""Batman Begins."" He doesn't see himself as a hero. And although he despises Dent for stealing Rachel away from him, he deeply admires him.Here we draw the dichotomy of ""White Knight"" (Dent) and ""Dark Knight"" (Batman). Bruce Wayne knows that he can't have Rachel unless he gives up Batman forever. But there's a pain within him that keeps him out at night fighting his personal demons. He loves Rachel, the same way Dent loves Rachel, but he won't give up being Batman. Bruce Wayne is not a noble, self-sacrificing hero. He has his cake and wants to eat it too.Equally, Dent wants to fight a hard line with crime. He's incorruptible, unwilling to compromise, doing it for principles of righteousness rather than personal glory. He, too, refuses to be a hero. But unlike Batman, he is self-sacrificing, fighting in broad daylight in full vulnerability, even if it puts him and his loved ones at risk.Don't worry-- Nolan never lets this character drama drag the story. The movie is wall-to-wall action, with sensational stunt sequences that exceed any prior Batman film, primarily because it uses very few digital effects. It's got a gritty, organic feel of urban combat, like Michael Mann's ""Heat"" which brought us into a downtown LA war-zone where gunshots echo off the walls of buildings. As we witness a chase between an 18-wheeler and a SWAT truck, we know it's actually happening. Many filmmakers neglect what Steven Spielberg calls ""geography,"" and consequent quick-cutting and stylistic shots make the viewer lose their sense of setting. But Nolan keeps things very real, using helicopter shots and wide-angle lenses the way he did with prior films that depended on atmosphere (Insomnia, The Prestige).Most people familiar with the comics know that Dent becomes the villain Two-Face. But Nolan makes a statement with Dent's transformation to evil. Harvey Dent succumbs to crime because his life has endured tragedy, and everything he's stood for has fallen to pieces. Meanwhile, Joker isn't so much a villain as a sardonic force of nature, reminiscent of Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh in ""No Country for Old Men."" For most of the movie, Batman merely assists Dent in his war on evil. But in the end, Batman takes the fall for Two-Face's crimes, allowing Dent's legacy to live on. In this, he truly becomes ""The Dark Knight,"" because he allows the White Knight to triumph. Even though evil has apparently won the battle, Batman refuses to allow evil to win the war.I think many people write off superhero movies assuming they don't hold literary merit-- this was the case with Burton's zany Batman and Joel Schumacher's cartoon-like Batman. I hope ""The Dark Knight"" proves that such a belief is untrue. Check out the original comics or the animated series and you'll see there's a lot more being said with these characters. The Joker is not funny, like Jack Nicholson or Cesar Romero. He's scary. He's scarier because he doesn't take the world seriously. Fortunately, the film takes itself seriously, and it's one of the best in recent years."
7333,True,"I love Batman. In fact I loved Batman begins as much as I did the 1989 Micheal Keaton one. But This one I believe has sold out. It was obvious they're trying to tap into the 'saw' audience by making the joker some kind of ultra realistic disgusting serial killer. Nicholson's performance was so superior it's not even funny. The heath ledger joker had no class whatsoever and was a completely unbelievable bullshit philosopher through out. WHy did he have a knife? Where was the long-ass gun joker's always supposed to have? Very 'saw'-like ""games"" that he played on the masses were a disappointment. The problem is also that the movie tries desperately to tie in ultra-gritty realism and philosophical justifications. It's a comic book for god's sake. Don;t try so hard to make it realistic. It was created with a lot of skill but just took the wrong turn from what I was hoping for. All the situations where just contrived reincarnations of other scenes we've seen in other recent blockbusters. The hostage scenes: 16 blocks-inside man-other stupid cop movies. THe played out ""you have to chose the girl or some other chump"" just like in the spider man movie!Bat man begins was steady and a very creative new take on the comic. They should of focused the originality instead of making an overly-dramatic pile of feces.And two-face? one of my favorite villains. Seemed like they just pulled that one out of their ass and made him into a totally unpredictable dick that got added on towards the end of the movie and then killed off without ever doing anything remotely cool.the cell phone sonar thing was inane.so much potential, wasted"
7334,True,"A long time ago there was this movie, The Cook, The Thief, The Wife and Her Lover by Peter Greenaway which made itself a painfully obvious 'arty' movie i.e. you'd be a pariah to 'not get it' and worse, not like it.The Dark Knight suffers the same malady. Bloated with self-important preachings of 'we get the superhero we need', 'you either die a hero or live long enough to become a villain' and 'unstoppable force meets immovable object' yadayada. It dares anyone to NOT like it. NOT be kind to Heath Ledger in his final role.Oh please. Gimme the layers of Batman Returns any day. It was dark, deep and even had its tongue firmly in the cheek...Batman: 'What do you want? Penguin: Ahh, the direct approach from a man who hides behind a mask' Dark Knight is big with loud bangs and at best ONE character we can root for.Christian Bale, a good Batman, barely engages in the two and half hours.Gyllenhaal is wasted. As is Freeman.Eckhart's slide...too quick and convenient.And Ledger...like I said, how can anyone DARE say a dead man did a bad job? The only person who does his role great justice is Oldman. He is the only person you look forward to seeing on the screen. The rest...well...I'm sure the comic book fans will prop up Dark Knight's ratings but I'm hoping true blue movie buffs can set the record straight."
7335,True,"The Dark Knight was and still is nothing short of a masterpiece and a mind bending acting demonstration. The plot, special effects, acting, choreography, and the ability to entice a viewer into the movie itself, puts it in it's own category of genius. Heath Ledger is THE MOVIE. A perfect example of an actor who put on his best final performance, never coming out of character and before you know it; is dead. The Box Office original I saw 5 times. It was not that he died before the movie blew the box office up that made it do unique to me. Lots of people watched only because the actor was dead. That simple minded persona of the character was routed by him winning an Oscar and not being there to even accept it. Christian Bale did a great job, although I will state that the difference in his voice as Bruce Wayne and Batman was a little bit too dramatic. It is a comic movie though, so that makes it a minor mostly unnoticed issue. The greater picture is that The Joker came forth as not just someone who was funny, but pure evil, making the movie more realistic than its predecessor. This is not to take away from Jack Nicholson, as his resume' needs no drawn illustration, since he was the leading actor in only two movies to sweep every category of the Academy Awards ( The second being, The Silence of the Lambs ). Words cannot reiterate the acting that shook the world in The Dark Knight."
7336,True,"A sequel to the uninteresting Batman Begins start of the reboot franchise is not only exceptionally better than the first, but may just be the best film in the last few decades and could be the best one of the next few.As an avid fan of the original series, minus Batman & Robin for obvious reasons, and an avid fan of Jack Nicholson's work, I was reluctant to let someone like Heath step into the spotlight and try and change the character and make everyone remember that character as Heath playing it. I was dragged to the film by a group of friends during opening weekend.The film starts out with Joker cleverly robbing a bank and outwitting his associates. A number of the actors from Batman Begins reprise their roles, spare Katie Holmes as lovable Rachel Dawes. In this film, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) has conquered Rachel's (Maggie Gyllenhaal) affections while Bruce (Christian Bale) conquers his future and present villains. The Joker plans to use the mafia as his aid to corrupt and destroy Bruce after attempting to make Batman reveal himself publicly. Harvey goes insane and inevitably becomes Two-Face. As Batman races against time to save the innocent, he battles two foes and his own demons. Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine all reprise their roles.Although not initially wanting to see the film, I immediately fell in love with it. Heath beautifully played Joker and made his own interpretation of the character, and I'd say he did a better job than Nicholson. Aaron Eckhart overshadowed Tommy Lee Jones' work as Two-Face in the original series with his role here. Christian Bale grasps the character of Bruce Wayne while making Batman just as unique. Unlike other superhero movies, Batman and Bruce's voice are not at all similar.Overall, I praise Heath for a legendary job well done and hope that this film will be remembered for decades to come and people will still be talking about it 50 years from now. If Titanic and The Dark Knight were released at the same time, I am not sure Titanic would win financially. Superb job!"
7337,True,"I know it's a little cliché, but Batman has always been my favorite comic book character since childhood. I loved watching reruns of the 60s TV show in the 80s, but as I became a teenager, I needed something with a little more substance.Then came along a series of graphic novels and a movie (yes, just one with three embarrassing entries following)which gave me that.Now, as an adult, I find myself still needing more. Batman Begins gave me a taste of the Frank Miller and Alan Moore I liked so much as a teen. It was a start, and a good one, and The Dark Knight continues in that trend; giving more. People are right in saying that The Dark Knight is much more than a comic book movie. And true, it does fit well into the crime-drama genre, but it isn't as good a film as some I've heard it compared to (Heat, Scarface, The Godfather)... One thing about this series of films is that they are well cast. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Cillian Murphy; all good or great actors although if I were Cillian Murphy, I don't think I would have returned for that tiny little cameo; a minute and a half of screen time, two-thirds of which was whining (maybe he just really likes Christopher Nolan). Even usually mediocre actors like Michale Jai White and Eric Roberts turned in surprisingly good performances. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a marked improvement over Katie Holmes, but still I must admit letting out a sigh of relief when they killed her character off (I told you there were spoilers)...There are a few issues I have with the film, though, the first of which is Two Face. Two Face is one of Batman's classic enemies. They spend two and a half hours building character development for him and for what? To kill him off at the end? What a terrible waste. And he looked pretty impressive. Too bad. Second, although the Heath Ledger was great in his role and even though I think he looked great (some of my comic-geek friends hate the look), the Joker should have been slightly more playful or flamboyant. If they had just incorporated a tiny bit of Jack Nicholson, the character would have been perfect. Not over the top like Jack, but just a taste of looniness... Last are issues put forth by other reviews that I have an issue with. 1. The movie is geared too much to American audiences... Batman is an iconic American character and has been for 70 years. Shut up. 2. It's too long... It's only 12 minutes longer than Batman Begins... Again, shut up. 3. It's too dark and violent... I respectfully disagree 4. The Joker is too scary and he's not funny... aside from what I said above I, again, respectfully disagree 5. Bad writing, bad directing, bad acting... Must not watch a lot of movies...Anyway, I really liked the film, but I'm honestly looking forward to Iron Man 2 more than Nolan's Batman 3..."
7338,True,"Looking over this movie piece by piece, anyone could say it was excellent.The acting was phenomenal. Heath Ledger deserves every accolade that's heaped on him by fans and reviewers alike.The dialogue was sharp, relevant, and paced well.The action was mind-boggling, but not so over-the-top that you were taken out of the story. That is an excellent, and incredibly difficult, balance to achieve.The directing and camera work was outstanding.The music was great.Even the makeup and costuming deserves a nod, especially for the fascinating re-design of the classic ""Joker"" look. And I loved the new batsuit. (Nestor Carbonell was wearing eyeliner--was that a shout-out to LOST fans? :) ) All-in-all, it was a superbly *crafted* piece of art.****But I will never, ever watch it again. Why?***** Well, let's put the shoe on a different foot and see how it fits. What if the story of ""Lord of the Rings"" was told this way? What if, after their long, arduous journey, Sam decides that *he* wants the ring, kills Gollum to get it, then Frodo has to throw Sam into the pit of Mount Doom to destroy the ring...but destroying the ring doesn't really rid Middle Earth of Sauron, and Frodo spends the rest of his (short) life in disgrace, and dies of a broken heart? What would we say after we left the theater? ""Why the hell did I just sit through that movie? What was the point?"" Or what if Harry Potter was told this way? After 7 books and 17 years, what if it ended with Hermione being tortured to death, Ron blaming Harry and becoming a Death-Eater, Harry refusing to kill Voldemort out of respect for all living things, and the entire wizarding world blaming Harry for Hermione's death? What would we say after putting down book 7? ""Why the hell did I just read all those books? What was the point?"" The Dark Knight's over-arching theme was, ""You either die the hero, or live long enough to watch yourself become the villain."" The story that this movie tells is simply this: no matter how hard you try to fight evil, evil will take everything from you, and the world will be no better off for your sacrifice. If you stand against evil, here's what you'll get. Maniacs with no motives, misguided moralists, or simply ""blind chance"" will take the people you love, break your body, destroy your mind, and leave you with nothing in return. And as the Joker unflinchingly tells Batman, insanity is just a little ""push"" away.Oh, great.Does it surprise anyone that Heath Ledger had anxiety attacks and insomnia after immersing himself in this script? The creators of this movie used an immense amount of story-telling talent to create a film that tears hope away from the soul. Why? What's the point? What a waste of time, creativity, and resources! What a waste of a good story! What a waste of spirit!"
7339,True,"Before going to see The Dark Knight, I had heard a lot of rumors about how easily this movie had surpassed the hype around it. Yet, I didn't take all those favorable reviews for granted and decided to see the movie for myself without knowing that I was going to be in for a special treat by Christopher Nolan.Somehow, the director himself managed to keep the audience both entertained and thrilled during the two and a half hour duration of the whole movie, which I highly appreciate because only a director in full possession of his senses could deliver such a quick yet coherent story of the superhero we all praise.It would be a huge shortcoming not to say anything about the acting, especially which of Heath Ledger as the Joker. I wasn't surprised the least bit to see Heath, who played one hell of a character, steal all the spotlight from other characters whichever scenes he was in. He kept the tension accumulating slowly with his ability to face everything in a creepily calm way as if he was the mastermind behind the whole plan supposedly developed by the police force. The story went flowingly due to the Joker's plan to turn Gotham into chaos, Heath did such an unconventionally perfect portrayal of the Joker that all the audience kept finding their jaws dropped throughout the entire movie. However, in one or two scenes,the Joker was taken by utter surprise; such as when he thought the citizens of Gotham city would turn their backs at each other and pressed the button triggering a deafening explosion to save their own lives on the ferryboat; but they didn't because no matter how chaotic the situation they were in, they did realize that everyone is human being and no human being should risk other people's lives to save their own.Christian Bale as the Batman also did fulfill his role as the protagonist, the superhero of the movie. Batman himself has two identities: the playboy millionair and the man behind the batsuit always ready to fight against the evil. The complexity of the character's inner feelings requires not only a great but also sensitive actor to truly understand it and, fortunately, Christian Bale acts as if he were born for the role, born to be Batman. For many moments, viewers were feeling so insecure about the menacing Joker with his malicious laughter that something credible had to be done to put their minds at rest, and that was when Batman appeared. No one else other than Batman can confront the Joker, and like Joker said, Batman completed him. And no one else other than Christian Bale has enough whatever it is that makes Batman to make a comic character so alive.Christopher Nolan's knack for storytelling techniques paid off quite well in this second installment of the brand new Batman series. He is gifted in keeping us viewers at the edge of our seats, guessing and predicting what was coming around the corner while the plot unveiled deliberately. For a moment for two, I thought I knew what was to happen the next scene but the unprecedented plot twists insisted on proving me wrong. Christopher Nolan is known for his scenes of intertwinement of past and present timeline and this trademark move of his adapts perfectly to the end of the movie. A movie this great doesn't hit theatre everyday, so make sure you have already booked a ticket for the earliest showtime in the nearest movie theatre. I salute you, the Dark Knight crew."
7340,True,"How can you fight an evil that is purely psychotic for sheer randomness? This film could easily be a commentary on USA's War Against Terror, and how the hunters are not so different from the prey...If it was not said Heath Ledger was playing the Joker in all of his satanic glory then I would not have known who it was at all! The man finds the nastiest way to make sure he has no dividends to share for a successful heist and makes the robbery look like part of an innocent field trip; he uses a pencil in ways most of us would never even dream of in our wildest nightmares...Two new catchphrases have now evolved from the Joker - ""Why So Serious?"" and ""Let's put a smile on that face!"" How can you catch a man like that? Fetch another man who knows no boundaries nor jurisdictions, has immense funds to source his projects, his conscience is so passionate he appears cruel yet he wants to save lives - Batman, the avenging hero who walks in shadow, the Dark Knight! Christian Bale as the vigilante saviour who seeks to right the Joker's wrongs is an excellent reflection of how too far right is left in the War Against Terror. I feel for his voice when he grated it as Batman and used a normal register as Bruce Wayne.Seeing Aaron Eckhart play a Two-Face who did not care for his looks was a refreshing change for once, I did like that departure from the comics. Having him play a character that was an unmasked version of the Bat is rather intriguing, pity more could not have been played off of that aspect. I was annoyed that they chose in the end to kill off Two-Face/Harvey Dent, apart from the fact he did not die in the comics, he was also a thorn in Batman's conscience as the Dark Knight felt responsible for Harvey's recreation into the coin-flipping redresser of injustices via corruption.Gordon's rise to Commissioner was understandable yet a bit rapid, Gary Oldman playing a man far younger than he really is shows his talent for acting.Well-choreographed acting from a talented ensemble cast, near seamless directing from Christopher Nolan, the film is a bit long (nearly 3 hours) yet very much worth it - hard to believe they had even more planned for the late Heath ledger in this same flick... His replacement has a deep dark clown-nose to refill, if possible. In fact, can there be any more without him?"
7341,True,"When I walked into the movie theatre and saw the movie -The dark Knight, I was knocked speechless by the accuracy and the ferocity in the movie. The movie is a phenomenal film featuring some of the best graphical sensations in the world and also the devastating recreation of characters. The characters in this new movie of batman recall greatly to the original DC comic, they all resembled in some or all ways to the original concept of the Batman superhero. This as a movie that has a superhero that has ""no special powers"", Christopher captured the catch of the personalities precisely. The men in the movie are presented in a grim and eye-renting way(even batman and Harvey), it re-makes the sensation of the changes and alteration to the characteristics of the characters. The movie contains multiple scenes of gargantuan scale conflict, greatly re-knitting the feel of the grand scale of Joker's plan. A Story is not a good one unless it has the three great conquest of life : Love, power and truth. The movie Batman- The Dark Knight captured the turn and twist of all three great. On specific notes of the characters , the Joker is the by far the most interesting and outstanding one. He dresses in exactly different manner compare to Batman (batman wears all black and joker wears a purple jacket and colorful make-ups). He is completely nut in the squeal which is a fairly big contrast to the last squeal made about Joker. He claims himself to be a ""mad dog chasing a car"" in the movie, that ""he would not know what to do when he catches the car"", and yet, he rescued ""Lao"" the mob billionaire, and later on burns the money. He is frivolous, well-tempered(strangely) and terribly unpredictable. He strikes when you are most unexpected. In this squeal, the joker wanted desperately to prove that all man will be as savage as him when they are about to die, he once said in the film , "" you know why I use knifes, because guns are too quick, you never get anything out of it. But knifes, you can see who a person really is before they die."" He wanted to show the world that even man like Harvy Dent, the White Knight(which is a contrast to batman as the dark knight), can be corrupted and be driven into madness and blind justice. Batman as the major protagonist, resembled greatly to the previous batman except a lot more mature and yet more uncanny is his sense of authority and skill. He was more well equipped and scary. And most importantly, he has the mind of a criminal, that's one reason that he can put an end to joker, since joker is definitely not a guy that plays by the rules. This batman is a lot more bewildered in his mission to save Gothem and yet more convinced that ""the day that Gothem will not need Batman"" will come soon. In the movie, Alfred is more than just a house keeper but more of a adviser which is quiet a change from the original DC comic. Bruce is shown multiple times in the movie in his torn relationship between being Batman and Wane the billionaire. He began to seen his limitation as both batman and Bruce wane. With all that said, I conclude by saying again, a great movie, enormous success, and really deserves to see it in theatre.-Written in contribution to Heath Ledger and a great thanks to Christopher"
7342,True,"Director Christopher Nolan had a very difficult task ahead of him once he decided to make a sequel to his hit Batman Begins in which he had created a new Gotham City much different from the previous franchise. With a great performance from Christian Bale we got to see a new and more realistic Batman and a much more interesting Bruce Wayne. The question everyone was asking was whether or not Nolan could match what he did with the first film in this sequel. Nolan had already created a new Gotham City, but could there possibly be anything new he could add in the Dark Knight that we hadn't seen in the first one? Or would this be one of the many franchise films that are ruined by sequels that should never had been made? These questions are answered right away for us viewers from the opening scene when a bank robbery is taking place and we are introduced to the new character, the Joker. We had seen how great Bale was as Batman and we also had seen the performances from Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Gary Oldman who all gave a new dimension to their characters (and continue to be great). But what sets The Dark Knight apart from Batman Begins and gives it a new and fresh look is the introduction of the villain, the Joker, played by the late Heath Ledger. Ledger gives an inspiring and Oscar worthy performance in his role as the immoral, evil, and violent Joker. One cannot explain or understand crime and violence and that is what Ledger represents as the Joker, an individual who does things for reasons that we cannot comprehend. It is hard to rationalize what is going on in his mind and why he commits all the atrocious crimes in the same way we could never understand the true criminals in our days. Another new character in this film is the highly moral and loyal Harvey Dent played by Aaron Eckhart. He symbolizes everything the Joker does not. He is all about good and fighting crime, he is the voice of reason over emotion. This is where Nolan goes right and gives the franchise a fresh look, focusing on the new characters and giving them greater dimensions than the previous ones we were already introduced too in Batman Begins. This movie franchise is much more than special effects and action, it is about creating interesting and complex characters and underlying a message of the struggle between good and evil in our society. I have to admit that along with Iron Man these two are the best superhero movies ever made. The sequel is not only as good as Batman Begins but in my opinion superior thanks in most part to Heath Ledger who added an entire new dimension to a well known character as the Joker. This film is not about Batman, its about the Joker and the struggle between finding the evil in everyone or finding the good. Heath Ledger is this movie as much as Robert Downey Jr. was the movie in Iron Man. My favorite film of the year which in my opinion is much more than entertaining, it is complete."
7343,True,"Oh, where to begin? This film was absolutely incredible. I have almost zero complaints about it. Of the few that I do is the set direction. A commenter before me mentioned that Gotham felt like any average American city, rather than the Gothic, dark style that was presented to us in the comics. Heck, even the first film gave us more of a sense of darkness than this one did. The city was a dark, dirty, gritty mess, with extremely dark lighting, long shadows, and buildings that looked decades old. In this one, all we got were clean modern skyscrapers with a few dark warehouses and docks thrown in there. Why the sudden change in set decoration between the two films? Other than that though, this film was fantastic. Heath Ledger did an absolutely brilliant job as the Joker. So brilliant, in fact, that I didn't even notice it the first time I watched the film. I spent the whole movie just being absolutely captivated and pulled in by his performance that I just thought, ""Yes, that's Joker. That's just who he is."" It wasn't until I exited the theater that I really thought, ""Wait, that wasn't Joker. That was Heath Ledger playing the Joker!"" Truly phenomenal. I completely agree with those who think he should be awarded an Oscar posthumously. Granted I haven't seen every film of the year, but it's hard to imagine somebody doing better than what he did with this role.As for the complaints about Joker's ""purpose"" in the film, or his ""motivation"": I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm pretty sure that his motivation was purely insanity. Alfred even makes mention of it when he says, ""Some men just want to see the world burn."" Of course, this led into the great line later when Bruce asks Alfred how they eventually caught the bandit he was talking about at the time and Alfred tells him that they had to burn the forest. Essentially telling Bruce that he would have to become the very thing he wanted to fight, if he wanted to stop Joker. And yet, despite all this, Batman overcomes Joker's attempts to make him break his one rule, and still manages to catch him.As for Harvey Dent, I loved him. His transition from the White Knight of Gotham to the deranged, vengeful, chance-using Two Face was both believable and tragic. Having to tell Rachel, his love, that it would be alright, even though he knew that he would be thought of as more important and probably chosen over her to be saved was just tear-jerking. The only part of Two Face that I was disappointed with was his death. He is truly my favorite Batman villain. Thinking of chance as the only unbiased reasoning, the only incorruptible, is just a truly brilliant character and plot device. I am sad that we won't get to see it again in another film. On the other hand, Joker's psychotic devotion to chaos will hopefully make up for it in future films, though having to recast Joker may detract from the role detrimentally."
7344,True,"This movie was a complete turn around from Movie 1. Movie 1 has darkness, grace and sense of awe. The second movie was choppily edited, bad continuity errors such as bike driving into mall scene where it approaches window to smash through then cuts to scene where it hasn't even got near glass. Im thinking who edited this! The worst thing of all was the choice of daylight scenes all the time as opposed to the dark look of the first movie. Gotham might as well be Chicago, we saw no CGI strange skyscrapers and no monorail system. It looked too normal and helicopter shots of buildings looking sunny. Wheres the dirty gritty feel? No new weapons, no secret weapons that could kill everyone. The main character just uses standard guns, rockets and TNT, oh yes and some dogs. Wow. Real imagination being used here, not! No flashback scenes to show Batman in training years, no references to his youth and wrestling with his past... no references to the Jokers past or flashbacks to how he became who he really is now with his cut mouth. All just skipped past.I was left thinking Mr Nolan, is this really you directing this. It could easily looked like any other movie out there.I did enjoy the movie but its a pale 5 out of 10 compared to the first movie. A lot of catching up to do in the next one. Its a bit like the matrix, how do you top it. Well at least you try... not relax and start to get lazy."
7345,True,"What is this? I can't explain all the enthusiasm for this movie as anything else than necrophilia. Let people die and suddenly everything they do is great. And indeed, Heath Ledger is great in this film. But he's the only one. And lucky for him he's good. Because he has done his share of bad acting in the past. Though I must say he was improving quickly in recent years. I loved him in the Bob Dylan-movie. I hated him in 'Brokeback Mountain'. His performance was too much of a performance there, a number of tics and tricks. Christian Bale is awful here. He looks, acts and walks in and through this movie as if he's the same character from 'American Psycho'. His character is a sleazy bastard, who thinks his money and his own vision is enough to save the world. The arrogance of the character is highly disturbing. And what is the character of Maggie Gyllenhaal doing in this movie. She's a silly women running after the wrong men and paying her life because of her bad taste in men. And are we supposed to cheer for Harvey Dent until he shows his true face? What an asshole. Is this one of these disastermovies which want to warn us for the disastrous future we're heading to? It's so sad to see all these positive reactions. Who are you people? Don't you see the aggression? And are you that silly to accept all the lack of logic. On the one hand this film want to be realistic and dark, over the top dark yes, but still... But then on the other hand it forgets all logic and reality whenever the screenwriters feel they have no logic explanation to give. How some characters suddenly survive when everything is burning and exploding, I don't know. And the whole movie we're after the Joker, but when they finally get hold of him, we don't get to know what is happening with him. I am a huge fan of 'Memento' and I also thought 'Insomnia' was a great and clever full. But as clever as the former films of Nolan were, as stupid is this one."
7346,True,"good movie? yes. Greatest ever? not even close. Don't get me wrong, Heath Ledger gave an Oscar worthy performance that will be talked about forever, but this movie was extremely lacking in all other departments.First off the movie starts off with the extremely overdone film device where the main bad guy publicly kills off all the other bad guys he's with because he's just that evil and to get the audience to understand ""hey this guy is seriously evil."" Now this was pretty cool when Darth Vader did this like 3 decades ago, but this has been done hundreds of times in mainstream movies. Quit doing it. On top of that each bad guy is completely surprised when they meet their end. Then new bad guys who should be aware of this keep following him anyway. Despite killing off his own followers his numbers grow and grow.Then Bruce Wayne who is supposed to be this lonely reluctant hero goes back and forth from living the playboy life to trying to do the forbidden love story without any emotion at all. Then he keeps saying how he has brought the Joker upon the people of Gotham and it's his fault while he shows no emotion at all. If you write a story about someone who feels responsible for the deaths of others, show him drinking liquor, breaking stuff, swearing, etc. Don't just have Bruce Wayne walking around in circles saying ""it's my fault, the Joker must be stopped"" while doing nothing for more then half the movie.Heath Ledger takes this movie from an average comic book movie to a good film on his own, but that's it, this is no where close to the greatest movie of all time."
7347,True,"Batman (Christian Bale) hits the streets again with his most famous foe, the Joker (Heath Ledger) as his foe. Where the first film in Nolan's new series expressed basically the problems with Batman's double life, this new film focuses (to whatever it extent the film can be said to have focus) on the effect that he has on the criminals themselves and the culture of ""Gotham City."" The most successful and surprising aspect of the film is the way that it truly makes the audience believe by the end that anything could happen (i.e. one of Gordon's kids could really die), as opposed to most superhero movies where the outcome eventually becomes obvious if not tedious. Ledger's performance is also a huge factor in the film's quality. He's really scary, not over the top at all in a bad way.My problems with the film remain some of the same problems from ""Batman Begins."" I think Bale is sort of a dull Batman, primarily because he's not really convincing as Bruce Wayne. Specifically his version of Bruce Wayne is so cool and composed that it would seem obvious to everyone that he's Batman, whereas Michael Keaton for example seemed like such a doofus at times in the Bruce Wayne persona that you could believe that people would assume he was too much of a dilettante even if they did suspect him a bit. Believability is strained, even within the context of a superhero film, when Wayne slips away from his party and then moments later replaced by Batman, and yet nobody suspects.One thing I also liked about the Burton films was that Nicholson's Joker was both funny and terrifying, whereas I noticed all the jokes that Nolan tried to pull with Ledger's Joker came off flat. The dark atmosphere of the film is so unrelenting that the audience does not really feel inclined to laugh, and that produces an effect that dulls the overall edge of the action scenes. I tend to prefer superhero films that take themselves less seriously, yet this one was so well done in its own style that I would actually rate it higher than ""Iron Man"" for example despite the fact that the latter was actually more my type of movie. You just can't ask me to take crimefighters in capes and armored suits seriously for 2 plus hours, but this movie actually came amazingly close.Halfway through the movie I was thinking that it really wasn't any better than ""Batman Begins"" which I thought was somewhat mediocre, but then Ledger's performance really hits the high gear. I loved the dialog scene between Joker and Two-Face (Aaron Eckhart) in the hospital and the bit with him walking out. Also Batman and Joker in the interrogation room was a very strong scene. The really scary possibility that Ledger's performance raises is the possibility, perhaps only glimpsed, that the Joker might actually be more sane than Batman or even more sane than the average ""civilized"" person. ""I'm just ahead of the curve"" he says, and we almost want to believe him. These ""supervillains"" spring from essentially the fertile ground of Lon Chaney's performances in films such as ""The Penalty"" in 1919, where he was a legless criminal mastermind who wanted revenge on the entire city of San Francisco -- yet Ledger takes it to still another level by doing an irrational, anarchic take on the idea. He actually recites various versions of his invented ""backstory"" to his victims as if to mock their desire to contextualize his behavior through some rational explanation i.e. ""my father beat me"", ""my mother didn't love me."" The concept of revenge or even psychological compensation is just another joke to him. If indeed he is ""insane"", his ego will not allow him such a luxury and his very purpose seems to be to deny us the consolation of a rational or formulaic explanation for his brutality.I wasn't disappointed with the film at all -- this is basically as good as this type of thing gets. It wasn't a truly great film like Nolan's ""The Prestige"", but I didn't really expect it to be. I did notice some of Nolan's trademarks like the repetition of certain sounds and images in different contexts. I'm very excited by the possibilities for Nolan's next couple movies because this one is such a big hit that he basically has a blank check."
7348,True,"One of the things that makes young actor Heath Ledger's death from an overdose last winter most grievous--apart from the gratuitous loss of any young human life--is that he, and his role as the Joker--are the best things about ""The Dark Knight""--the latest in the Batman film franchise.Both the role and its realization by Ledger represent the most credible portrayal of a movie villain in films that are based on comics, or that, like in the James Bond franchise, are usually cartoonish. (Consider that the typical Bond villains are what Mike Myers, most notably, parodies in his Austin Powers films, in the portrayal of ""Dr. Evil."" These quintessential miscreants who, often, seem to be motivated by world domination and or great riches, nonetheless seem to be inexplicably single-minded, blindered, and one-dimensional in their badness.) By contrast, the role of the Joker as written in ""The Dark Knight"" offers one of the most credible, well articulated visions, rationales for this antagonist's motives and actions. And, as has been more or less universally noted, Ledger's realization of the character is incredibly masterful, even nuanced, despite its obvious grotesque and larger-than-life qualities.The soliloquies in which the Joker articulates his dedication to cultivating chaos, vs. the well-laid plans and, he avers, ""schemes"" of society are among the most successful articulations of a point of view and impulse to dedicated psychopathic evil-doing. What's more, in a testament to the vision of those who came up with the story, this version of the character, and his lines, his apparent ""backstory"" is carefully crafted as a red herring. In one tete-a-tete, the Joker explains one origin of his disfiguring scars, which suggest a mocking grin. But wait--while threatening co-star Maggie Gyllenhaal with a similar disfigurement, the story is entirely different. While some films legitimately seek to humanize real or fictional figures as, while perpetrators of horrific crimes (think of ""Monster's"" characterization of murderous prostitute Aileen Wuornos, for one), the device in the case of Ledger's Joker rightly deprives him of an unwarranted overhumanization. At the same time, the writing and portrayal keep this Joker in the realm of something potentially real--still ineluctably human--as opposed to Jack Nicholson's and Cesar Romero's past, overly stylized and cartoonish creations. Obviously, the awesome makeup and costume design for the character support these effects, but they would hardly do the job on their own.Other than on those merits, the film is good, maybe very good; not great--typically, not worthy of the hype and anticipation these kinds of presumed blockbusters generate. And I say that with no lack of regard for Chris Nolan (I love ""Memento"") and the film's other creators. It's just that I, perhaps more than more typical moviegoers, just can't work up much genuine buy-in to these comics-based extravaganzas. In this case, the film is long, and, at least for me, has too many interim climaxes. Of course, the first capture of the Joker is just too easy to be final ... but the number of reversals and resurgences and climactic twists that require heroic resolution and which propel the plot ambulations, were, to me, eventually emotionally deadening. At least the film discards some classic story and film-making conventions in order to further the story--like the kind of breakthrough risks ""Seinfeld"" took in its willingness to have really bad things happen to people, as the setup for the conceptual humor of the initially revolutionary sitcom. (E.g., an attractive and sympathetic character's experiencing significantly disfiguring, botched cosmetic surgery, as a foil for George's and Kramer's neurotic propensities. Numerous other examples could be adduced.)Ultimately, while the film seems less hokey and far-fetched than most in the genre--less so even than the plot line of, and caricatures populating, Nolan's initial venture in the franchise--it finally descends thereto with the fate of Aaron Eckhart's crusading do-gooder prosecutor character, Harvey Dent. (""Dent"" as in his chin cleft?)Further, while the overall arc of the movie offers to explain how Batman came to devolve from a mere outlaw vigilante theoretically wanted by the law but really covertly valued by Gotham as a whole, into a true outcast--a reviled figure who is perceived as having made too many moral compromises in order to give the apocalyptic city not ""what it deserves, but what it needs""--it churns through a lot of bodies, special effects and somewhat wearisome exposition and development getting to that moral. Christian Bale's somewhat flat characterization seems hardly to carry that theme--his flippancy as Bruce Wayne and menacingly gravelly voice when he's Batman just don't flesh his character's demons out in a meaningful way. While the film is mildly satisfying in view of that theme (like the last-produced ""Star Wars"" movie was in its depiction of Anikin Skywalker's transformation into Darth Vader), the true enjoyment comes from watching Ledger. Fortunately he's on screen a great deal. I stayed through the credits to make sure there was a gesture made to his loss and memory. There was. It is, in the universe of filmed entertainment--with the thought-provoking lessons it can, at its best, offer--quite a loss indeed."
7349,True,"I have to admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of ""Batman Begins"", actually right after I watched it I came right here to IMDb, and just tried to explain why the movie didn't work for me, while every person on the planet came out loving it. 3 years later, I really don't care much about ""Batman Begins"", but I loved this movie, ""The Dark Knight"" corrected everything I didn't like about the first one, I loved every second of it, I even loved the Scarecrow cameo, the Falcone mention, and of course this movie works in every level, because it gives us a formidable opponent for Batman, and that's of course The Joker, he really steals the show, he really is as crazy as you think he's gonna be, the way he lies about everything (even his origin), the way he explains everything, the nurse outfit, everything was just perfect about him, Ledger really deserves an Oscar, this role alone makes him worthy, and I think that the millions of people that watched this movie can really discredit the Academy if that doesn't happen.I read the review I made three years ago for ""Batman Begins"", and really, even if you hated the first movie, there's nothing of that in here, Bruce Wayne is the ultimate anti-hero/hero/not-a-hero, Alfred is not a pain in this movie, Lucius Fox it's not just there for the lines, Rachel is really strong and really becomes a tragic hero, and Two-Face was really great, and not just a second fiddle to the Joker, he really is just the two extremes of a man, Gordon finds his place in Gotham, and the Mayor is Batmanuel. The music by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard works this time around, and is not just buzzing in the background like in the first one (By the way the Joker theme works really great on the screen) OK, the reason I did all of this, is because I needed to tell everyone, that this is the Batman movie you've been waiting for, the movie that goes to those dark places you knew these movies were destined to go, but actually never went. So go ahead and watch the movie already, stop reading my bad writing, and put a smile on your face..."
7350,True,"I left the theater with a grin from ear to ear. AMAZING! Absolutely astonishing... fantastic cinematography coupled with great writing and gritty fight scenes... my expectations were FAR surpassed. Easily the best comic-book movie out there.However, there were a few things that did get under my skin... such as Christian Bale's voice behind the mask. Why does he sound like a nasal congestion victim coupled with constipation? No good. One plot hole that really got to me at the 'fundraiser'. Maybe someone else will notice it? Also, the bike.... ugh, the bike.... a bit cheesy for my taste, but maybe that's just me.All in all though, it was extremely well done and look forward to the next one being even better, if that's even possible."
7351,True,"I must admit that this movie should receive the trophy of ""Anthem of a generation"" for incredible bad movies of the new era of film making. First time I've heard of this movie was from a friend who told me and I quote ""Man, this movie is on the top of IMDb list, we have to see it"" so I did see it. I was expecting something great , but after one hour I was sick of it and left the room. It is non stop action with no script ,nothing at all.All you see and hear in this movie is bum-bum,bang-bang and not even some cliché lines, nothing artistic ,the only plots in this movie are kinder garden plots and they are tied in an anarchic structure.The only reason to look at this movie is to see special effects and CGI.Batman begins is a much better movie than this one.Christian Bale's performance was less than mediocre even if everyone praised him for reinventing the character of Batman.It brings nothing new the Batman concept, the only actor who did something was Heath Ledger (Joker). You would probably ask why is rated so high.The answer is that the marketing and the propaganda did a great job infusing in people minds the idea that this is a good movie, plus the rating of a movie it is mostly subjective and when you say that a movie costs $180 million and it has all of this presumed great actors people will say ""Gee that is a great movie"".And the critics do you think that they are honorable people who rate movies with objectivity for the good of the people, of course not they have to sell the newspapers they work for.And once i asked an American friend why do you listen to a popular band at that time and he said because it is what is cool now and what people listen, i don't agree with him so when you rate a movie listen to your inner self not others."
7352,True,"I just came home after the projection, and I remain mesmerized. If you're like me and go to the movies only once a month or less, make sure you don't miss out on The Dark Knight. I'm sure you've heard all the praise about it. Well, it's true. It has the carefully crafted dark atmosphere of Batman Begins, but Nolan takes it up a notch, so that it really hits you hard. It has the commanding performances of Christian Bale, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine, and Aaron Eckhart. It is also Heath Ledger's swan song, which is more like an oratorio. While I hadn't seen much of his previous work (surely an omission on my part), his Joker took me in completely. Whether he was wielding a gun or wearing a nurse's uniform, his presence was infectious and menacing. His masterful portrayal of the agent of pure chaos, combined with the really heavy topics the film tackles (love, loss, justice, revenge), leaves a deep imprint in the mind of the beholder. The technical side of it - camera work, make-up, costumes, SFX - is immaculate, particularly because it does not get in the way of the characters for a single second.Batman has always been my favorite superhero. I am grateful to Christopher Nolan for reinventing him so skillfully and making him so human and so tangible. He has assembled a wonderful cast of endlessly talented actors and crewmen, and I look forward to his next title. Although, surely, The Dark Knight will be hard to beat."
7353,True,"Majority of people who criticise this movie say that either it is too long or isn't good enough.Well here is my review, see this film simple as that as for a long time it has characters that I actually believe, now I know that people may say that should not be the case in batman. Well batman has always been the most realistic hero as he is a character, who anyone in the audience who become if they had the inclination and the training. Heath Ledger as the Joker was superb, he had 4 classic scenes, which will live long in my memory for example the first time he appears in the gang meeting seems to be so taut and unpredictable that in my showing people laughed at the ""magic trick"" My favourite sequence is the jail scene joker owns those sequences for example the conversation between him and the police officer is so spell-binding and interesting that my focus was on this scene for the rest of the film. Now this is not a one man show by no means.Gary Oldman shows why he is one of the best character actors out there today. He is subtle and seems like a man unsure of the force he is facing and feels that the batman is the only one who understands the joker, Christian bale is really good as batman and bruce wayne especiually the part in hong kong plus on a side note has anyone noticed that they not have a batcave that they can sell to kids? Is it too long no, because in that argument is pirates of the Caribbean too long? is godfather too long? no because they are the perfect length to tell their stories. Dark Knight told its story people may disagree but as I will always say its my opinion. Is it a perfect movie no but its a perfect crime drama and the best comic movie."
7354,True,"I'm a really big Batman fan, and Batman Begins had blown me away. I had been so anxious about this movie, I thought I was going crazy! And then the big day came. July 17. I rushed into the cinema with my parents, and when I got out, I was left completely SPEECHLESS!!!! This is no ordinary movie! It's a cinematic PHENOMENON! The Nolan Brothers have done it again! So this time, Batman has officially declared war on crime in Gotham City, along with Lieutenant Jim Gordon, and the new District Attorney Harvey Dent. And when they are so close to wiping out crime in the city, a new EVIL arises. A criminal mastermind, an incredibly intelligent, but absolutely insane man. A personification of anarchy, evil, madness, chaos, cruelty. The most iconic, deranged comic book villain of all time. THE JOKER. With his rise, chaos returns to haunt Gotham for one more time, and Batman will have to face his own demons more than ever.I think it's my obligation to start with the most astonishing performance I've ever seen (except for Marlon Brando in The Godfather). The late Heath Ledger as The Joker. Heath gave so much to that character, he was so scary, so perfect, he is surely going to win an Oscar for best actor. Mark my words. I've never seen The Joker like that before. His best incarnation. R.I.P. Heath Ledger.The rest of the major cast gives very good performances. Cristian Bale is really good as always as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He is more troubled than before, and has to fight his own demons to maintain balance in his life. Michael Caine is the best Alfred Pennyworth there is, as the father figure of Bruce Wayne. Gary Oldman's character, Jim Gordon, becomes much more important, as he belongs to the major trio that fights crime in the city. Katie Holmes is replaced by Maggie Gullenhaal for the role of Rachel Dawes, who is in fact the source of antagonism between Harvey Dent, and Bruce Wayne. She's so much better than Katie Holmes, I'll give you that, but seriously, she is NOT pretty. Aaron Eckhart does a remarkable job too as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, and Morgan Freeman is still doing really well as Lucius Fox.The direction by Christopher Nolan is nothing but an incredible achievement. He gives you that dark atmosphere that fits perfectly for Batman. The music by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard is just masterful, taking you to an amazing trip throughout the whole movie. Of course, we shouldn't forget the screenplay by the Nolan Brothers, which is absolutely flawless, and unpredictable.What else can I say? The movie is terrific! It's gonna win many Oscars, that's for sure! SPOILER AHEAD---- The last scene where Jim Gordon talks about Batman is just EPIC!!!! All four times that i've seen the movie, this scene always gave me the chills!!!! ----END OF SPOILER Don't take any second thoughts. Just go, see it, and you'll see that these 154 minutes of your life will have been wasted wisely."
7355,True,"When Christopher Nolan and company delivered the superb origin story of Batman Begins, the shift in tone and ambition from previous superhero comic book adaptations was both riveting, and most welcome, if not curiously overdue. Using that as a springboard, The Dark Knight reaches places that are utterly stunning and overwhelming in the depth and scope they reach. This movie goes far beyond what any previous comic book movie has come close to, creating a haunted and comprehensive study of crime, morality, and tragedy. The story poses numerous moral and philosophical dilemmas for its characters, forcing them to make choices that can have devastating consequences, while also showing the duality that exists between sides of what is moral and immoral, civil order and chaos, truth vs. justice, loyalty to those around you and your own established boundaries, and the gray areas in between.While the vast landscape and powerful narrative that Christopher Nolan and his team have woven is a huge factor, a significant part of the reason the conflicts achieve such a forceful impact is because of the immense power of the performances from a talent heavy cast. Returning as the Caped Crusader/Bruce Wayne, Christian Bale continues to infuse the character with a remarkably conflicted and ultimately tragic quality. Bruce Wayne has troubles that have deep roots within him, constantly disturbed and driven by his past to uphold his strict moral code to deliver justice to Gotham, while trying to maintain a human grip on sanity within him, and for those he is close to. Bale brilliantly conveys this inner turmoil, in a character that is very low-key, reaching depths that his predecessors hardly even hinted at.As the loyal butler to Bruce, Michael Caine delivers another wonderfully composed Alfred, who more or less acts as Bruce's moral conscience, and provides the balance for him as well as the film itself. Morgan Freeman also delivers his reliable class to Luscious Fox, serving as Batman's technical supplier, and even manages to deliver some pertinent commentary on the issue of excessive individual power over a population that strikes a contemporary chord. In a much more central role this time around, Gary Oldman deliver's a quietly stellar performance as the righteous and unyielding Lt. Gordon. Maggie Gyllenhaal proves to be a welcome upgrade from Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, adding a confident edge and swagger to the character that was not as evident in the previous narrative. Other newcomer Aaron Eckhart delivers what turns out to be a startlingly moving, and forceful performance, very effectively showing the trajectory of the very determined and confident district attorney Harvey Dent, to his tragic fall from grace. Those familiar with the subject matter will be privy to what he sadly becomes.The most central newcomer is the Joker as portrayed by Heath Ledger, in what is a monumentally sadistic, maniacal, and frighteningly unsettling performance. While Jack Nicholson and past performers provided wickedly entertaining interpretations, what the filmmakers and Ledger have crafted here is something remarkable in its viciousness, and sheer nihilistic relentlessness. This Joker has very little that is amusing about him, no matter how amusing he finds everything else. He fully embodies his self proclamation of: ""I am an agent of chaos"", taking a sort of fascination and amusement at the notion of stripping power away from those that feel they possess it, and breaking down any notion of order that exists in Gotham. The Joker is like a constant moral plague on the law enforcement and Batman, constantly setting up scenarios which force them to make decisions that may violate their ethical codes and have dire consequences. As brilliant as Ledger is and as domineering a character the Joker may be, the fact that everyone within the story hold their own and don't get overshadowed is a testament to how strong the ensemble effort is.. Any overshadowing seems to be coming from sources outside of the film that want one performer/unfortunate story to overshadow everything else.The technical aspects are simply stunning. Christopher Nolan and his technical crew have created a vast and stark Gotham, drenched in a dark and moody atmosphere much like Batman Begins, where the weight of the city is felt in every scene in what is a masterful work of visual composition. The action sequences are electrifying, continuing from the first film in a gritty, near-realistic style that is minimal on CGI and heavy on stunt work with crisp editing, that along with the whole film progress at a relentless pace. The 2 ½ hours fly by, with a constantly imposing tension and sense of peril filling every frame.There isn't really much more one can truly ask from this electrifying, uncompromising and rich experience. The movie goes places that haven't been close to being reached in the genre, and transcends it altogether in a way that is immensely satisfying, and fulfills and I say even exceeds the promise that the first film established and has been built up for until now. This is in my view the richest and greatest comic book/superhero movie ever made."
7356,True,"This is an intelligent well written movie with some great performances but it is not a Batman movie. Apart from getting a fingerprint from a bullet there is no detective work. There is no use of batarang (throwing stars etc.) Batman doesn't fire his cable thingy and swing from any buildings. In fact he doesn't use any items from his utility belt. Another major flaw with this movie is the absurd use of every mobile phone in Gotham as a sonar, which Batman uses to track the Joker. This sci-fi technology is out of place in this movie, mobile phones don't have receivers in them capable of coming close to this level of wizardry. A true batman would of used his detective skills to find the Joker. The Joker only makes one joke in the whole move, albeit very funny (disappearing pencil). It's OK to reinvent characters but there should be some consistency and I think jokes are for the Joker."
7357,True,"I saw this movie twice and both viewings have not changed my initial thought. Grossly over-hyped, a lot of muddled dialog (particularly when the Dark Knight speaks) and some really silly and unacceptable plot holes. What I won't do is detail these holes because they've been mentioned and opinionated on hundreds of times already. Well, one, and only one: The Jokers recurring speeches about how he is an agent of chaos and he's not a man who plans, he just does things. Ring,ring,bells,buzzers and a red flag for ya'--Every single scenario and setup in this film would have to involve major planning and tremendous attention to detail to pull it off, ie: rigging explosives in hospitals, on ferries, and in a precinct--all of these places are public domains-- surgically implanting cellphones, penthouse home invasions full of politicos, dignitaries and all their accompanying security people. Point made? This paragraph will be for the true film aficionados. Can we agree that in order for a movie to be bestowed with accolades like (the following terms, with the exception of genius or awesome can never truly apply to something artistic or creative in nature) best ever, the greatest, genius, the most misused and overused word in these times--awesome--, and many other pretentious terms it has to hold up to scrutiny when all the hype has left town? For those who have a good reference point for films regardless of genre, budget or era in which a film was made, I can't see how they won't see this film as anything more than fairly entertaining, unremarkable and pretty forgettable.One other thing-- and this may really appeal to all my hardcore film people out there. Something struck me as interesting the other day. Get a hold of a copy of the Exorcist III if you can (if your a real film beast you might make this connection just from memory) and when you get to the scenes where Brad Dourif is in his cell talking with G. C. Scott pay attention to his speech patterns and his mannerisms. Its almost like Mr. Ledger subconsciously or even overtly brought Dourif's performance into his portrayal as the Joker--which I found to be energetic but far from 'genious', 'groundbreaking', 'instant classic','awesome'and the many other bru-hahas coming out of so many pie holes.I'm saying all that to say this, Ledger may not have been influenced by Dourif's portrayal of Damien Karras but it illustrates that hardly nothing is new or groundbreaking and rarely is something totally different in modern cinema.For those interested, post up on IMDb if you view that segment in Exorcist III and can juxtapose it to TDK's Joker portrayal. You guys tell me if something seems soooo... familiar or not.3 out of 10 from the non-sheep / non-fanboy set.--I just had a thought fart--Should give it 2outta10 for casting that annoying little whinny kid from the Mist (Gordon's boy)."
7358,True,"If ""Batman Begins"" was dark, then ""The Dark Night"" is pitch black. Large parts of the storyline is driven by deep personal tragedies for the main character's, with resulting evolution for most of them. This is apparent in Bale who is of the few left from last time. He has clearly grown more into the role of particularly Bruce Wayne. As far as the hype surrounding Heath Ledger goes, Ledger is great. Copying some of Nicholson's mimics from ""Batman"" and finding a great balance between the sheer madness and the calculated evil that makes The Joker. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, however, is much, much better. He brings life and complexity to the politician and crusader Dent, and whilst Ledger makes good on a great role, Eckhart makes perfect of a lesser character. He steals many of the scenes he is in, whether pitted against Bale, Gyllenhaal or Ledger. Nolan has done himself a huge favour by letting the evolving of characters move the film forward, rather than the other way around. Nothing ever feels forced, unnecessary or boring, despite a run of 152 minutes. The are fragments and clues spread around in a large portion of the aptly written dialogue that make the audience pay perfect attention when the intensity of action is lowered. What Nolan does best though, is contrasting Dent and The Joker. Dent will draw away from choice and consequence by flipping his coin (a wonderful symbol after it actually has two different sides) and act accordingly, whereas The Joker will force the conscious choice. Both for Batman and the common man there are exruciatingly inhumane choices to make that make you cringe at the very thought of them."
7359,True,"wow, some time ago I saw the dark knight and all I can say is :wow.the film started as a crime film and ended as a real dramatic story. the joker is the only ""bad guy"" I like in the batman series and Heath ledger preformed an amazing enemy.The story of Two-Face was dramatic and sad, 10 times better than Jones (Batman forever)BAtman himself was probably the best of all. my favourite scene : every scene with the joker.only one disappointment : the film was to short.Yesterday I red that the sequel would contain the Riddler (good choice) and the Pinguin (afwul choice)All I can say is : hopefully the writers erase the Pinguin and replace him by another enemy."
7360,True,"I wasn't sure what to expect from The Dark Knight a sequel to Batman Begins and, by virtue of extended franchise, a remake of the Tim Burton 1989 Batman movie, which also featured Batman, the Joker, and Harvey Dent (though not Two-Face). The previews had all the action and excitement, and some cool-looking gadgets, but... despite the whole ""Heath Ledger is dead, this is final great performance"" hype, I didn't want to second guess myself. A Joker with no real ""origin"" story? Ledger playing him with slapped on, sloppy make-up and lots of facial tics? How will this work, and how could it be any better than Nicholson's Joker? Answers? It does work, very well, though it's dependent on the universe that director Christopher Nolan has set in place. Ledger's Joker wouldn't work in Burton's style, as his mix of camp and seriousness was perfect for an actor like Nicholson. But in Nolan's world, he fits in like a f***ing psychotic glove. To get it out of the way for this review, I'll say this: Ledger practically lives up to the hype. His presence is uncouth and strange, and not like one's used to (the slashes through his face are ""jokingly"" referenced that ""my dad did this, ""my wife did this""), and he's totally ambiguous. But it's also the unpredictable Joker seen yet on screen, and only topped probably in the craziest of the comics. He's an unpredictable force that is the twisted ying to Batman's protect-by-all-means-but-murder yang. It's basically an anarchic punk rocker taken to the lengths of a terrorist.While this should make the Joker boring, there's nothing that Nolan isn't willing to do to make the audience jump or second guess the plot, which makes it extra exciting as he heads on in the last half hour, leading to an incredible double-catharsis of sorts. But if Ledger's performance is being touted for an posthumous Oscar nomination (which I'm still not sure about though will probably happen), then the amount of attention being paid to Aaron Eckhardt is minuscule in comparison. On his own terms, Eckhart delivers a performance that's even better than Ledger's (or, rather, he has a lot more complexity than ""I'm gonna blow stuff up and go chaotic here""). He puts in everything that's needed for the perfect Harvey Dent, as a man who's the ""white knight"", someone who could be the one to take the place of Batman as the one to look after Gotham. His downfall, however, becomes the great, horrifying tragedy of this Batman. To say Eckhart blows all other interpretations (on film or TV) of Dent is putting it lightly, and the make-up given to his latter reincarnation is some of the best I've ever seen.In the interest of not coming off like a total crazy fan-boy for the Dark Knight, there are some likely criticisms to have. Despite Nolan's vision being epic and grand, and for the most part pulling off such a big story very well, the last section, however exciting and tense and posing moral questions, goes a little long. And, however staying true to the comics (which is great), the last section starts to pile on the exposition a bit much. But these are mostly mild quibbles. In the scope of delving into the Batman world as honestly (if not realistically) as possible, Nolan succeeds even further than in 'Begins'. The characters of Batman/Wayne, Gordon, Dent, and Rachel Dawson are all put into incredible circumstances throughout the film, and we're pulling for them and care about what happens all the way. It's all the more a credit to the storytelling power since we should know how things will turn out; a certain twist mid-way through had me thinking ""say it isn't so"", and when I knew I was had, I knew Nolan had done his job well.Another question: does Dark Knight live up to the hype? It depends on how you define it and how it pertains to the movie. A lot of the hype has been around Ledger's death, and the new characters, and some of the hype (i.e. box-office predictions) have become ludicrous. Yet, for what Nolan set out to do as filmmaker, delivering drama and action and pathos and a kick-ass-but-truly-conflicted Batman in his *very* dark city of Gotham, he succeeded admirably. It might not be the same amount of pure ""fun"" of Burton's films, but then again it doesn't need to be. It's an excellent, breathtaking experience, and one of the best pics of 08."
7361,True,"I can't tell you how disappointed I am in The Dark Knight. My friends and I waited for months to see this and it was a film I was expecting to see numerous times. Having viewed it, I wouldn't watch it again unless someone paid me a lot of money.I'm a science-fiction fan so I on board with artistic allowance as long as it's consistent with the framework of the film. There were several violations in this movie that I don't understand how people/fans can get past.I'll site a few examples that I feel cheapened the movie beyond repair: 1)Right out of the gate in the opening scene, since when can Batman bend a steel gun barrel with his hands? 2)Bruce Wayne is now smart enough to network all the phones in Gotham City and stick the results into a database? Last time I checked, my phone didn't have sonar technology. The phone that Morgan Freeman brought to Hong Kong was described to have special capabilities. Yet suddenly Bruce Wayne is able to extend that capability to all 30M citizens phones in the city? The most idiotic part was when Mogran Freeman was analyzing the output and suddenly the Jokers face appeared on the screen immediately in front of him. Did the Joker stop by AT&T before that scene to upgrade his phone? There were about 500 mini-screens in front of Moran Freeman and he just so happened to be looking at the one where the Jokers face appeared. I wanted to leave the theater at this point.3) If you are admitted to the hospital with burns on half your body and your clothes are saturated from lying on a floor with gasoline, the hospital will remove and dispose of your clothes when you are admitted. Yet when the Joker freed Two-Face, Two Face suddenly had his half-burned clothes back on for the remainder of the movie.4)Who planted all the explosive charges in the hospital for the joker? There seemed to be hundreds of devices that were suddenly in place (and conveniently no hospital staff noticed). Oh, and how convenient that the Joker had a friend or a bomb in the right place at the right time whenever he was in a bad position. Something like this is okay in couple occasions in the movie, but not in every scene.5)What was the point in having the Lamborghini in the movie just to be destroyed. Cheap thrill.Ledgers direct performance was great. I just wish they had built a simpler more believable movie around him. I wanted this movie to be great as much as anyone here. I expect a certain level of consistency and believability from the movies I watch. Again believable within the framework of the movie. As much as I wanted TDK to be a great movie, I couldn't even will this movie to the level of awful."
7362,True,"OK--this review will be FULL OF SPOILERS so please read it at your own risk.Batman (Christian Bale) is trying to clean up Gotham City with Police Chief Gordon (an unrecognizable Gary Oldman) and crusading D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). However a psychotic madman named the Joker (Heath Ledger) wants to take over Gotham (for no discernible reason) and kill the Batman. His plans get increasingly more diabolical, many people die and Batman starts to wonder if he can stop the Joker...and if he's responsible for him.OK--I realize the Batman movies are supposed to be dark--but THIS dark??? This movie is chock full of violence--people are casually shot to death left and right(but there's no blood so I guess that makes it OK). There are some spectacular stunts here but all the violence and dark tone rob them of any of the wonder they might have had. There's next to no light moments and the movie gets increasingly depressing as it goes on. And the Joker casually hurts or kills people with no warning. There's also a thoroughly despicable scene where a little child is threatened with a gun. This deserved an R--NOT a PG-13.The needlessly convoluted story doesn't help. The movie goes on far too long (lots of people in my theatre were checking the time during the last hour) and gets confusing. Characters appear and disappear with alarming infrequency and one character (the guy who was going to reveal Batman's secret identity) disappears completely with no resolution to his story! The Joker here is rightly played as a psychotic madman but Ledger is NOT good in the role. His speeches sound stilted and he's not really acting at all. His character isn't frightening--just incredibly annoying. I found it hard to believe that all these characters were stupid enough to buy his ""explanations"". Also he plans some explosions and plots that are just impossible--even in a comic book movie.Acting does help. Bale is just excellent--he's not getting enough praise for his acting. He manages to show Batman's anger and pain even in that padded suit and mask! Eckhart is just superb as Harvey Dent--and Two-Face later on. Maggie Gyllenhaal (taking over for Katie Holmes) and Michael Caine (as Alfred) were also good. Surprisingly Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman aren't that good. They seem to be phoning in their performances. Ledger--what can I say? He's WAY over praised. He was OK but all this talk of an Academy Award is just ridiculous! He wasn't that good. His death was tragic and I can't imagine what his family is going through--but a tragic death does not automatically make you a great actor.I basically found this movie too dark, too violent and even dull! Some of the acting and fantastic special effects can only work a little. This gets a 3 from me."
7363,True,"Wow. Can't believe how high the rating is for this film on IMDb. Did we all see the SAME film?? Wow.Okay, just got back from seeing this, and I gotta say, I was very, very disappointed. Overall, the movie had its moments, but maaaan oh maaaan, was this movie WAY TOO LONG. And unnecessarily so. So far, Christian Bale has proved to be a satisfying Batman, but NO ONE has lived up to my vision of what Batman should truly be up on the big screen. That said, let's move on.THE VIEWING EXPERIENCE: The WORSE PART about this movie for me was the editing. It was unforgivably choppy. Too many scenes ended too abruptly and I guess a whole lot of stuff happened off camera because there were a considerable amount of ""GAPING PLOT HOLES"". THE ACTION: Very intense from the beginning which was great, but the movie peetered out toward the end. That whole scene with Harvey Dent holding Gordon's family hostage was just way too long and too over the top. Dent's transformation into evil happened too quickly, which made his descent into ""Bat-Villain"" unconvincing. It was like he was having a very bad tantrum, that's all. He needed to be spanked or hugged. Nope. Despite what you may read, there wasn't ANYTHING poetic about it. Sorry, Freudians. COOLEST SCENES: I really liked the confrontation scene at the jail between Batman and The Joker. Great, great stuff. Batman was extremely close to ""losin' it"" and I thought for a second he just may kill him, he just might snap and do it. But nah. Batman isn't nearly as amoral as ol' Clown Face. Another scene I liked was when Batman was in Hong Kong kickin' some baddies asses, then he grabs the head honcho Asian dude(can't remember his name, sorry), launches some balloon thingy in the sky, hooks himself and the baddie to an oncoming plane (which of course was all arranged...I wonder who was flying the thing? Lucius?) which takes off into the night sky. That scene was TIGHT. Executed brilliantly. MOST MEMORABLE SCENES: The Joker making that pencil ""disappear."" The Joker walking away in a nurse's uniform as bombs go off behind him. Classic. Those images will stay with me for a long, long time.COOLEST TOY: The Batpod. Geeks will cheer.PERFORMANCES: Heath Ledger was good, yes. Did he give me chills and simply blow me away? Sadly, no. But perhaps I was expecting WAY TOO MUCH. After all, the buzz on his performance as The Joker started way back in January. Does he deserve a posthumous Oscar? No. An Oscar nomination should more than suffice for the ""kudos"" he's been getting. His death is what has swayed, or rather, ""manipulated"" people to say this is the most incredible performance ever seen on screen. Don't be so gullible. It's a good performance, don't get me wrong. But it's not history making. However, Heath now makes Nicholson's Joker look as campy and as ridiculous as Cesar Romero. Christian Bale had his moments; so did Aaron Eckhart. Gary Oldman is always a pleasure to watch. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine will always be veterans of their craft. Everyone else could have phoned it in.THE MUSIC: Not memorable. And in some scenes, shrill and annoying. Where or WHERE is Danny Elfman? WHAT BUGGED ME THE MOST: Batman's gravelly, and super LOUD voice. It sounded completely ridiculous and over-amplified. Not menacing. Just ridiculous. I thought the script tried too hard to send a message. What we got was sophomoric rhetoric which was overly ""preachy"".THE ENDING: A dud. Even though the movie was an agonizing 2.5 hours, I still felt something was missing. Batman being ""hunted down"" by Gordon and the GCPD was lame. The Nolan brothers should've written a much more satisfying ending. I felt cheated. There was not enough of a satisfying denouement for The Joker. He was just left hanging there upside down, giggling like a school girl on crack. They should've given The Joker a much more satisfying final scene. Like that last shot of Anthony Perkins in ""Psycho"", staring chillingly into the camera. Joker's exit should have been just as memorable and just as SCARY. What they gave us was WEAK. Pure and simple. And that really, really SUCKS since it was indeed Heath's final scene. His final image up on the big screen doing what he loved the most. They could've given him a better tribute than that. WHAT I'D LIKE TO HAVE SEEN: The Joker being FUNNY. Come on, people! That's what The Joker has ALWAYS been about. Not campy, but funny. Heath's interpretation of The Joker was nothing like in the comics. I understand the Nolan brothers wanting to be dark and all that, but let's get real and stick to story origins, okay? The Joker is a demented psychopath yes, but he's also supposed to be wickedly funny. You know, laughing at his own sick twisted humor. We got NONE OF THAT from Heath's portrayal. What he played was a character who should've been named The Sicko. Or The Money Burner. Or Chaos Man. In any case, the Nolan brothers, to me, failed to give us The Joker we all really wanted to see. Again, I liked Heath's performance. I did. But there was still so much missing. OVERALL REVIEW: I was entertained by this film, but was sadly disappointed with the pacing, the editing and some of the gaping plot holes. And what sucks is that I'm a HUGE Batman fan. HUGE!!! I SOOOO wanted this film to be a masterpiece, but it wasn't. Not by a longshot.I actually gave this movie a 6 out of 10 stars, but most of you made this movie's rating on IMDb just unforgivably TOO HIGH."
7364,True,"The biggest problem with this movie is that large parts are dedicated to a theme that has been done to death by the Left Wing Progressives of Hollywood. The absurd premise of this entire picture is that if you kill someone, no matter the justification, you yourself become the bad guy; it's cliché, it's worn out, and it's just not true. To someone who accepts this pseudo-philosophical garbage, the Dark Knight might have some sort of meaning, but to the rest of us, it's just a rather silly message that turns Batman into a gibbering do-gooder with both hands tied behind his back. I'd put my faith in David Cameron before the weak-ass Batman portrayed in this movie - and that's saying something.In the real world, a mass murdering psychopath would be hunted down and shot without any remorse whatsoever. No-one would care. There is no grey area here. IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME IN REAL LIFE. IT IS LAWFULLY ACCEPTABLE, especially when the said murderer is in the MIDDLE OF A RAMPAGE. Instead, in Nolan's fantasy world, killing a despicable killer (even to save others) is a no-no. Batman would much rather keep his 'morality' intact by sparing the killer time and time again - even at the risk of his own life. There are numerous examples of Leftist propaganda in this film, and silly scenes that serve only to give the liberals a warm heart, like the serious criminal who decides to throw away the detonator in order to save innocent lives. GIVE ME A BREAK. I'm not buying that cliché drivel. It's time for Hollywood to enter the real world. This film is an apologist for criminality.How on earth has this garbage managed to fool so many people? Given that the main theme of the film is utterly flawed, you won't be surprised to learn that almost all of it is. Like all of the films in the Nolan trilogy, there are WAY too many inconsistencies, plot holes, and totally unbelievable situations. Batman Returns is largely more realistic than this film is, and it wasn't even trying to be realistic. THAT should give you a good idea of how bad this is. At least the fast-cut editing has been toned down a little from Batman Begins.The biggest mistake this trilogy made was to meld the comic book craziness with real life logic in the hope of making a gritty, realistic Batman. News Flash: The comic Batman is totally and utterly unrealistic. You either create a decent comic film, or you take only elements that can generally work in the real world. This trilogy tried to create some kind of hybrid and, because of that, it falls flat on its face. But even the parts that should be believable regardless are done badly - like the police force. In order to make the joker a super-villain, Nolan made everyone else a super-moron. LAZY WRITING.There's not enough space to expand on every point I've made, and the film throws another curve ball at you before the end: The main law maker himself has a 100% reversal into a super-villain, because the Joker killed his wife hahaha. As you can no doubt tell, the script is completely bonkers. If you are going for realism, then don't insult my intelligence with this crap, Nolan.Imho, the Dark Knight is the strongest of the three films, but it's still a giant mess. My rating: 5/10."
7365,True,This movie was so hyped for no reason and so boring everyone I talk to told me that it was OK but kind of boring this is the same answer I get from people I don't even know now that I think about it know it's kind of like breaking bad someone said it was great so everyone else saids it two beuase they heard the talk from one source it was interesting but don't watch it if your kind of tired it will put you right to sleep just like breaking bad if you have sleeping problems Breaking bad and this movie are the cure and I still think even though the 90 batmans are stuipd they are close to the comic books that we all read unlike this movie which is the exact thing and who ever said dark is realistic I live in arizona it's bright all the time maybe in Alaska that would be realistic in my lifetime there are nothing but colors that surround me so who ever said that is a idiot .
7366,True,"I've always been a fan of the Batman legacy, and when the hype was going around about Batman Begins and a fresh start for the Caped Crusader since Tim Burton's movies, I was looking forward to the movie. But at the movie's ending, a sequel was guaranteed. When I went to see The Dark Knight on the day of it's release I thought it was brilliant, a great sequel, Christopher Nolan did an amazing job once again. Christian Bale was excellent as Bruce Wayne/Batman again, Aaron Eckhart was also brilliant as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, he made that part his own and pulled off the good guy District Attorney role brilliant, and he pulled off the evil coin flipping Two-Face brilliant also, so I can only applaud Aaron on a brilliant performance.The person who stole the show was the late Heath Ledger as The Joker. When it was announced that Heath was to portray the Clown Prince, everyone was unsure on Nolan's choice of actor, including myself. But Heath proved everyone wrong, he did a brilliant job as The Joker. With Jack Nicholson's unforgettable performance in The Joker's first big screen appearance to compete with and no doubt Nicholson is a superb actor, a true legend. But as much as Nicholson did a good job as The Joker, Heath Ledger's performance puts Nicholson's in the shadows. To change the character from Nicholson's joke filled, funny man persona to Ledger's sick, twisted, psychopathic persona was brilliant and the actor pulled it off brilliant. The way he captured the insane clown personality was perfect, the character was brilliant, taken away from your normal villain, who robs banks for money, trying to take over the world, blah blah blah... But Ledger's Joker was the villain who if he had the money he'd burn it (like in the movie), he don't care for world domination, Joker's only interest was to as Michael Caine's (Alfred) line goes, ""Some men want to watch the world burn"" which is what Joker wanted, he don't care for anything or anybody, not even himself. Which was genius, his performance as the Joker will go down in history as one of the best, and will not be forgot for a long time.As for the rumours going around on the net on threads saying Nolan should cast the Joker character in a 3rd Batman Movie (if there will be a 3rd) I think they shouldn't cast another Joker, even though the Joker wasn't killed off at the end of The Dark Knight, they shouldn't re-cast a Joker for a 3rd because I don't think that any actor in the business can fill Ledger's boots as Joker. Even though there are some brilliant actors out there, they should introduce new villains for a 3rd and let the superb performance Heath Ledger gave us be remembered for what it was... ExcellentAnd just adding I've read some threads and rumours surrounding a 3rd movie, about Philip Seymour Hoffman as Penguin and Johnny Depp as Riddler, for one, Hoffman is a brilliant actor and would be brilliant in the part. Depp don't need my praise his work speaks for itself, the man is amazing. So I'd give the nod to those two for those roles, but the rumours around about a possible return for Eckhart's character Dent/Two-Face would be good too, with Eckhart still playing the role, but if they keep Eckhart as Two-Face they should cast another villain and not cramp it up with too many characters like Spider Man 3 did which was poor. Anyway, Brilliant movie, amazing work from Nolan, brilliant performances from the cast, mainly Ledger, and here's to a 3rd movie.Rest In Peace Heath Ledger"
7367,True,"I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either. I am shocked it has such positive reviews and raving fans. I give it a 5/10.My biggest complaint is about the overall storyline, which I felt was lacking. There seemed to be a bunch of characters ranging from very interesting (Heath) to not as interesting (Michael Caine & Morgan Freeman felt like non-characters this time around). And then there was a bunch of scenarios, some very tense and cool (the joker pitting the two boats against each other), and some very tired (didn't the hostages wear the masks in INSIDE MAN?). But there wasn't a great throughline to pull me through.In my opinion, a series of miscellaneous scenarios, a villain vs. a hero, and a smattering of people with assorted agendas does not make a solid storyline where from scene to scene I wonder what's going to happen. I got bored at times. It felt like a fantastic premise, but no story.I also don't feel much for Bruce Wayne/Batman character this time around. I haven't seen Batman Begins in awhile, but I'm pretty sure they show us his human side and that his laziness/womanizing/partying is just his Bruce Wayne cover-up. In this movie, he was cold. The kissing scene was ridiculous. He kisses Rachel then strides away with one hand in his pocket like he doesn't give a care at allwhich pretty much makes me not care about his character at all either."
7368,True,"Loved this movie..I'm a big fan of Heath Ledger from his '10 things I hate about you' days, and will always and forever remain a fan of his acting! The plot was great, every actor/actress' were phenomenal..especially Maggie G. as Rachel. So, yeah, maybe ""the batman"" didn't have to make his voice so deep, but he definitely had to change it to separate himself from Bruce Wayne..I thought it was fitting.So..to the poster ""Mozared"", below me, to answer your questions, why did Dent turn bad and why didn't he kill the joker when he had the chance?...Dent believed in fairness his entire life, that's what he lived by...when things started to become unfair in his eyes, such as his love being killed and his current predicament, to him, the only fairness that was left is flipping his coin. When he flipped it with the joker, he landed on heads..the joker lives, same with Maroni in the car scene, and Ramirez. Even if it causes chaos, like when you stated...him ""turning bad"". The joker, as well, convinces him that ""chaos"" is fair, as well as convincing him he,the joker, was locked up at the time, so Dent needs to go after the people who actually put him and Rachel in the warehouse. It was fairness in a sick way, if you will. Basically, Dent is just like Batman..he has rules he lives by. We all know what Batman's was, and Dent's rule was ""fairness"".Now why does the joker have so many loyal men?, well it's simple these men aren't working with a full stack of cards! And actually in the original series, his 'men' came from an asylum, called Akhram...crazies, bi-polar, schizophrenics, you name it. He was able to ""lure"" them to do bad things for him, it wouldn't be that hard when they're ""not well"" to begin with!...as you saw with the guy Dent interrogated in the alley..Batman explained the joker, ""feeds off these men"". And lastly, why is the Joker able to get around with explosives and no one noticing him?....well he has too many people working for him, that he bribes with money, as we saw, and you definitely don't think he set those traps up himself, do you? plus, they're ""cheap""."
7369,True,"After reading several reviews hyping up this movie as IMDb's best of all time, I had to se it. As with most movies i have high expectations to, I get disappointed after seeing them. This is no exception.There are several thing that bugs me in this movie. First the hangover whiskey voice of the batman character is annoying. It would be better if he spoke like Bruce Wayne. We know its him anyway.Second I think its to long. Instead of introducing yet another character (Harvey Dent/ twoface) they could have cut him and at least 30 minutes of the film.Third, I was waiting to se more of the joker character.I also noticed really lamer editing at the end of the movie. After twoface dies, batman tells Gordon (Gary Oldman) that he takes the blame for killing the innocent people and cops. Then the movie drifts of to where Gordon holds a press conference telling everybody what happened to Harvey Dent. Then suddenly they cut back to the same scene with batman and gordon at the scene where twoface just died.For me this movie is far from the best movie ever made (like many IMDb reviews states). To mention a few, Full Metal Jacket, A Clockwork Orange, Requiem for a Dream, Scilence of the Lambs, The Shawshank Redemption, Schindler's List, Goodfellas, Fight Club, The Shining and many more beat this movie by lightyears.The only thing stopping me from giving it 4 stars is the joker. Heath Ledger is the best joker to date."
7370,True,"This is one of those rare films where my expectations were not only a bit higher than normal, but they were also equally fulfilled.Nolan is giving us a number of stories here, almost more like a Gotham Chronicles story than JUST a Batman story. This film is as much about Jim Gordon, Harvey Dent and even the every day people of Gotham as much as it is about Bruce Wayne/Batman or the Joker.What impressed me about the writing is how Nolan was able to convey, in a very real-world sense, the anxiety and life-questions that a man like Bruce Wayne would have to make as a true, living breathing crime fighting vigilante. There was cause and effect of being such a figure and his impact had more repercussions than he foresaw. The psychological warfare between Batman and the Joker (even Dent) is mostly well-handled and illustrated, adding a nice layer of richness to the film's finished product. However, sometimes Nolan tries to include TOO MUCH, and there's times where scenes are left a bit unfinished or have loose ends, which is too bad, but mostly forgivable.On the flip-side of ""real-world"" sensibility, one personal disappointment is that the credo of Nolan's Batman about ""realism"" (technically and physically) is nowhere to be found here. All the care and effort to explain Batman's gadgets, his trials and errors as a rooftop leaping vigilante all are gone. We don't see the time it takes Wayne to develop something of Fox's into his Batsuit or repertoire. In one scene he's shown it, the next he's using it in almost unbelievable scope and fashion. Much of the action demands much more suspension of disbelief (unlike in Begins), and a lot of it plays out like a James Bond film. In fact, this is more or less ""Batman 007"", which ultimately, isn't such a bad thing since we're talking comic source material here. Nolan makes up for this deviation with purely satisfying Batman fanfare action sequences and capturing our hero at his best.The film is a bit bleak and very dark in tone - Nolan doesn't pull a lot of punches and the result is plenty of moments of grim suspense and anticipation. This is wholly satisfying for many Batman fans, especially the Joker, who is played at his darkest core. I found myself holding my breath with anticipation at a few moments, and Nolan seems to change up the outcomes JUST enough to keep you guessing. I wouldn't recommend this to kids under 12 or so. Not so much gory, as it is intense subject matter and mature themes.I found the performances of all the cast to be top-notch. In fact, the Joker (exceptionally well-played by Ledger) begins the film as a question mark, and ends it just the same, which I think was sort of the angle here. His purpose is more or less to force Batman to question his own limits and reasons for purpose, using madness for this reason above logic, making him Batman's most enigmatic foe.We also get to see the promotion of Jim Gordon to Commissioner, which was anticipated given his lesser badge status in Begins. Oldman steps up his game from Begins, and his role serves as the best view for the audience.Maggie Gyllenhaal is a more watchable Rachel Dawes, but her character is little more than a device here. By the end of the Dark Knight, it's clear her purpose was far better suited in Begins as Bruce's childhood friend. Still, Gyllenhaal is plenty serviceable and doesn't take an ounce away here.Harvey Dent is perhaps, the biggest surprise of the story and I was impressed with Aaron Eckhart's performance. His story is perhaps the greatest arc of the film, although I thought his ""point of no return"" was a little rushed and hard to believe.Morgan Freeman is back as our new favorite ""Q"", Lucias Fox, offering up new technology for Batman's disposal...but we also get to see a bit of his role as head of Wayne Corporation and his own personal convictions and responsibilities.In the end, I would qualify the Dark Knight as the the best Batman film to date, going back as far as you want to. I can also say this is quite possibly the best COMIC film to date. But what surprised me, was that this was one of the best CRIME films I've seen in a long time.The Dark Knight offers plenty of bang for your buck."
7371,True,"First off, this is a fairly good movie. I'm not going to say it's the best of 2008 by any means, as I can think of many others that are better, but it is a good movie. Most of the performances were great and the action was good. The problem I had with it was the length and the dark theme. My understanding however is that it's closer to the original theme of the comics, so I suppose that's the way it's supposed to be, but personally I don't care for that.Speaking of the dark theme... if you have kids, this is probably not a movie you'd want them to see. It's a bit graphic and the whole beating up the dogs thing was a serious turn off. Not to mention Two Face's faceless side. It was just a bit much.One thing I have to say is something that is a bit touchy. Prior to seeing this movie, I had read the reviews of how ""amazing"" Heath Ledger's performance was and I thought to myself that this was an insult to him. I mean everyone only begins to rave about his performance only after he dies and not before. I felt that they were only saying it because he did in fact die.I'm happy to say that I was very wrong and believe me, I wouldn't say this if I didn't feel this way. Personally I think Heath was obviously not the least bit intelligent for dying the way he did. It's unfortunate that stupidity caused his death, as so many before him. I cannot possibly admire anyone like that and they never learn, do they? In any case, Ledger's performance was indeed amazing. He owned the movie and it's a shame that we'll not see him reprise the role. Oh well, life is hard and it's too bad some don't know how to keep it.I do have another gripe too. I understand that in order to make things realistic, they have to make Wayne's voice disguised, but does Bale have to sound like he's gritting his teeth when he's speaking every single time Batman opens his mouth? Surely there was a better way of disguising his voice.Finally, as I mentioned above the movie was just way too long. I found myself wishing that it would simply end, only to be disappointed that it was still going on like the Energizer Bunny.Aside from those things, it was an okay movie. I can only give it a 7 out of 10, but I'm not a big super hero fan so that's probably why. My husband thinks it's a 10 so he should probably be writing a review. He says it's very true to the comics and is a great depiction. I'll just have to trust his word on that."
7372,True,"Is there anybody out there that was more excited about this movie than I was? Maybe but most probably not. I've been looking forward to another Batman movie since the credits rolled on ""Batman Begins"" back in 2005. Batman is a movie that needs no synopsis, even for non-fans. But in case you are totally clueless, all you need to know is that Batman is a guy that dresses up in a bat costume and fights crime in Gotham city. The Dark Knight continues where Batman Begins left off. Christian Bale reprises his role as Barman from the last movie, and this time he has two new villains: The Joker, played by Heath Ledger and Two-Face/Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. This is no doubt the most hyped movie of the year, especially with Heath's sudden death, and I must tell you it was up to the hype, or very very close to it. There's a buzz for an Oscar campaign for Heath and I'll tell you right now that he was absolutely amazing and deserves an Oscar, or at least a nomination. If Warner Brothers didn't tell us Heath was playing The Joker, I swear not many people would have guessed it was him. I know I wouldn't have. So is this a good movie or just a good-Joker-used-to-promote-an-average movie? Good question. But an even better question is did you watch Batman Begins? Did you enjoy it? If you watch this movie, you'll never want to watch Batman Begins again because The Dark Knight will make it look like the worst movie you've ever seen. I promise you. Everyone is talking about The Joker, but Harvey Dent/Two face is equally as good. His make- up, as Two Face will blow you away, and his acting is nothing less than amazing. Everyone else reprised their role from the last movie; all except Katie Holmes which if you ask me is a good move because I felt she didn't really belong in the first one. She is replaced by Maggie Gyllenhaal, which I love. Director Christopher Nolan is a genius (Yes I know all the directors I reviewed are geniuses). He not only made an awesome superhero movie, but an awesome crime/detective movie. His brother Jonathan Nolan worked on the script, and since I saw Memento which the two worked on, I know that these two were born to work together. So is there anything bad about this movie? As another critic rightly put it, ""This movie was too long, but I'm only saying this so it seems like I'm doing my job..."" That being said, I don't think the length of this movie is a problem at all. I mean, The Godfather ran for almost three hours, I don't hear anyone complaining. Moreover, in most long movies, you'll see a scene or two that can be cut to shorten it, The Dark Knight had none. It was pure two and a half hours of awesomeness! The closing speech of the movie ended with Commissioner Gordon saying ""... he's the Dark Knight"". Then there was a black screen. It was at that time that I noticed tears rolling down my cheeks because of how lucky I feel to be alive to witness this cinematic masterpiece. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is the first movie I've given 5 out of 5 stars!"
7373,True,"First things first: there is no expression, ""close to the CHEST"". The accepted expression is ""close to the VEST"". Getting this wrong is small, perhaps, but making up your own expression is just stupid. Nowadays, the difference between getting something right and getting it wrong is ""whatever"" but this is remarkable to me that they simply got it wrong or made up their own expression. Oh, I'm sorry: you can't just make up your own expression.The movie is waaaaaaaaay too long. We hear the same speech like 9 times. And not just one ""same speech"", a same speech from Bruce Wayne, and from Batman, and from Rachel and CERTAINLY from The Joker. And the last 25 minutes is a story-within-the-movie that doesn't need to be there. I couldn't tell what little threads were important and which one's were not. That's a good thing in some movies but not here.After Gordon is dead/not dead, I kept waiting the Rachel Dawes to reappear. Was she really killed or fake killed? OK, again, maybe that's me, but it was a distraction. So is the presence of Anthony Michael Hall; why is he here? He's too familiar, typecast to be in the movie. Again, a distraction.""Oscar buzz for Heath Ledger?"" Are you kidding me? Makeup I did not like, a nervous pulse in his voice (but just for the first half of the movie. In jail, he doesn't have the consistency of that nervousness.) But an Academy Award? For what? HIs death, that's what. This was an interesting performance but that's all. Just interesting. I'm just being critical of an actor whose performance is being overrated.Further, you just know that when Heath died, these guys put in every single scene he filmed. Like pigging out at the buffet, you have to show some control. They did not. The movie is EASILY 25-40 minutes too long. And frankly, the whole ""savior vs. vigilante"" line that the whole movie hinges on is really pretty abstract. Gotham is being destroyed by crime, why split hairs? Batman Begins was clearly, more sharply focused, crisp. This is fat, overwrought, overweight and a waste of a really good cast.Maggie G. is perfectly fine but in her media interviews, she's beginning to take herself a little seriously. Hey! Maggie! You're no Olivier, baby. ""Batman Begins"" used violence as a metaphor; this movie is really just about the violence. Which, I guess, is why everyone likes it so much. This is a mediocre movie, tops. But since I loved Batman Begins, I'll just watch that again."
7374,True,"Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' is one of the best film I've watched or ever will. A perfect film in each and every aspect. 'The Dark Knight' is a treat for a cinema lover, I was gripped, Stunned and Amused to see such a great film. Its the highest grossing film after Titanic, in my opinion it deserves to be at no.1.Performance Wise: Heath Ledger will live through his portrayal as The Joker. Giving him any award, can not be as high as his performance. He's fantastic. The best performance delivered in the History of Cinema. Bale as Batman rocks. Aaron is outstanding as Harvery Dent and even as the short-lived two-face. Maggie is good. Sir Michael Caine is amazing as Alfred. Gary Oldman is a legend, he's fab. Morgan Freeman is tremendous. Others also excel.'The Dark Knight' is one of the best film ever made. Cinema is proud to have a film like The Dark Knight. Two Thumbs Up!"
7375,True,"When you think of superhero movies nowadays, most people would mention a Marvel Studio's flick given the sheer amount of characters they've been bringing to the Big Screen, Spiderman (3 times), Blade (3 times), the Hulk (twice), X-Men (3 times), no to mention the soon to come in Thor, Ant Man, and the Avengers.DC hasn't been as fortunate... Catwoman was a complete flop, Superman wasn't completely fulfilling, and even Batman Begins, while it was a great movie overall it never got the respect it deserved.Enter ""The Dark Knight"". From the very first millisecond your eyes glance the WB logo, you just simply can't take them off the screen. Beginning with what would arguably be the greatest bank robbery ever pulled off, to everything in the middle filled with great conversations and dialogue and non-stop action, to arguably the greatest and most anticipation building, cliffhanger endings you've ever seen.Heath Ledger is obviously the highlight, you can clearly see where the dedication to the last years of his life went, and it's a shame that we lost someone who was potentially one of the greatest to ever perform... but everyone knows this already. What you don't hear about are the more than exceptional performances given by Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Aaron Eckhart. Bale is great, don't get me wrong.The only things negative I have to say about this film is Maggie Gyllenhaal's mediocre yet tolerable performance (she makes you miss Katie Holmes A lot though), and Bale's horrible growling Batman voice... which he didn't do in Batman Begins? The latter point was obviously avoidable, and Katie Holmes was probably too caught up in the craziness of Tom Cruise, because there is no other way I'd have seen her turn this film down.All in all, this film is quite simply a masterpiece, it's so damn good you commonly forget your even WATCHING A SUPERHERO FILM. You in no way have to like action or hero movies in ANY way to LOVE this film. THIS IS WHAT FILM IS ALL ABOUT!"
7376,True,"Best Batman movie yet. I think it surpasses every other film, even Batman Begins.My favourite aspect of the Batman franchise is the villains, and they did a brilliant job with both the Joker and Two-Face. Sure Batman Begins had villains, but they were quite minor, and only got like ten minutes of screen time (we had no idea about Scarecrow and Ra's Al Ghul until like halfway through the film). Heath Ledger (RIP) and Aaron Eckhart topped Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Tommy Lee Jones and everyone else who portrayed said villains. I don't care if their origins aren't true to the comic books, they worked. That's all that matters.If there will be a third movie, I cannot wait. I don't care if villains like the Riddler, the Penguin and Catwoman have already had screen time, they need to have the Nolan treatment. Plus the Riddler hasn't been done justice yet. The 60's TV series doesn't count, and Jim Carrey wasn't much better.I can't see them including Robin or Batgirl anytime soon, but I think Hayden Panettiere or Ellen Page would be good as Batgirl. Just saying maybe.Christopher Nolan, I salute you. I hope you can continue to make more Batman films. Burton and Schumacher only did two films each, but Batman Returns was too dark, and Batman and Robin sucked. This was a very good film, and it had the right tone. So it is possible he may sign on for a third film."
7377,True,"Batman Begins was a highly enjoyable film and the first to be truly close to its origins. Tim Burton's films were good but the Bat seemed somewhat inanimate, cold and lonely (despite Alfred and billions of dollars).Killing off a major Bat-villain is always sacrilege in my eyes and the only thing that Schumacker did right with his two duds was to incarcerate the villains in Arkham instead of killing them off. you should at least leave a plausible chance of their return.Back to the 21st century and Begins did what all have failed before. Gotham is completely believable as a real city and not the hyper-exaggerated version of the 90s versions. The characters are a lot more convincing and more like their literate counterparts and perfectly ended with ongoing storyline of all the characters and the tasty teaser of The Joker.With the exception of the different Rachel this ""sequel"" goes for continuity in spades. Gordon recently promoted (All knowing that he ends up as commissioner and excellently played by Oldman)still keeping his head above water with the corruption around him. Harvey Dent rising to his expected post as DA after the previous one was murdered and his eventual fall from grace after being disfigured (differently from the written version). The only gripe with continuation in this flick is the sudden disappearance of the whole rail system from the original.The Dark Knight is brilliantly acted, expertly written (more of that in a mo)and properly styled.The good thing about the script is that everything that happens, all that is said is there for a reason, never (despite the long running time)does it feel like padding. Take the obvious, Dent saying ""you either die a hero or live long enough to become the bad guy"" which resurfaces towards the end, or the two scar stories from the Joker that ends with Batman throwing a punchline regarding the aforementioned scars.As for Dents final scene, like I said you should never kill off a major villain ( Big no-no in my opinion) but as Maroni said ""one professional to another if your gonna scare someone try a different height, from here the fall won't kill me"" (please forgive possible misquotes) Two-face didn't fall that far and technically Dent is dead, I want to believe Two-face ain't. (and much Kudos for Eckhart, simply brilliant).Despite really just being the glue that holds the film together, Ledger's undeniably brilliant (and spot on) performance of the Joker cannot be unmentioned in any review, terrifying with a very dark sense of humour (Watch as the Bank robbery at the start plays out like a joke.... albeit with a very funny but subtle punchline... Not to mention his ""magic trick"" which was worth the admission (or six) alone.As good as Bale was, it seemed like he needed an inhaler at certain points in the movie (understandably he would be knackered doing what he did anyway) but at a certain scene towards the end, he just seemed to have got over it in just a change of camera view.As for Oscar nominations, this is considered an ensemble movie where there is a big cast and all are good performances meaning that the stars are overlooked for other roles in other films. I do firmly believe in all honesty that Ledger deserves a posthumous nomination but as predictable as the Academy is, he will probably be awarded some sort of achievement award or something. I also believe that Gary Oldman deserves equal recognition improving on his role from Begins.The only thing (other than Begins) that comes close is the fan-made ""Batman; Dead End"" (see youtube).AS FOR THOSE THAT REFUSE TO WATCH IT BECAUSE IT IS A ""BATMAN"" MOVIE OR A ""SUPERHERO"" MOVIE.... SHAME ON YOU, LOOK PAST THAT STIGMA AND ENJOY WHAT IS Easily THE BEST FILM OF THE YEAR AND ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER (SEE IMDb TOP 250 FOR EVIDENCE)."
7378,True,"I can finally put the film in its proper context. When I first saw the movie, I went into it absorbing all the hype about how mind blowingly amazing it was and how it was an instant classic if not THE best film ever made. So I viewed the film in an intellectual frame of mind...and I loved it, but with some reservations. Firstly, I admired Bales performance much more then Heath Ledgers, who practically everyone said and continues to say stole the show. I thought he was an exceptional villain, but since he was a completely remorseless maniac, with even Ledger himself calling him a ""psychopathic, mass murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy"", I didn't know what to make of it. For a film that was going for ""realism""(as real as you can get with entirely foreign geographical locations like Gotham City and scientifically implausible devices and applications), having a brilliant, insane super criminal who somehow has limitless access to henchman and supplies, and can rig hospitals and ferry boats with explosives even when there is manhunt out for him right in the middle of a major metropolitan city seemed a little far-fetched. Didn't it? To buy in to the story, you have to accept that the various crime bosses and crooked business men have almost total control over Gotham. Of course corruption exists, look around you, but I just find it hard to believe that all the corrupt civil servants and mob members would have the ability to manipulate the entire city for the Jokers benefit.Anyway, what I really admired about the film was Batman himself. I see Batman as the ubermensch, I think he is human potential at its very peak, and I think Christian Bale did an outstanding job at it. He has emotions and deep feelings of love and compassion for people he cares about and the citizens of Gotham themselves. He is deeply touched that his Batman persona is actually making an impact in peoples lives, lamenting on crude vigilantes, yes, but relieved that he may one day retire from being Batman because of the new DA, Harvey Dent, who has been christened ""The White Knight"" of Gotham. He may get to relax and maybe spend time with his longtime crush, Rachael Dawes, but then the Joker enters the picture. Watching Batman become increasingly desperate to apprehend the Joker, whether through outright physical abuse, or abuse of technology(some sort of device to monitor peoples cell phones throughout the entire city simultaneously), it is actually a little disturbing to watch Batman become unhinged. What I also liked about Batman was something Henri Ducard told him in ""Batman Begins"": ""If you commit yourself to an ideal, you can become more than a man...a legend."" Batman has completely omitted himself to his code of ethics and morals, and built himself up to be the greatest human alive, look at how he easily evades the attack dogs late in the film. I think that any benefit we can get from superhero stories is how the hero can teach readers or viewers to reflect on these morals and apply them in real life, who doesn't want to be Batman? The Dark Knight makes me appreciate Batman Begins much more then I had previously, the former accentuates the good qualities of the latter and gives it focus, a sense that it is one part in a longer struggle.The supporting cast are all excellent. Aaron Eckhart played Harvey Dent, the third lead in the movie. While I thought the hospital room scene wasn't totally believable, I was honestly moved by Dent slowly moving into insanity because of the Jokers actions. Not when he laments about how his girlfriend was taken from him, but during subtler moments, like when he was talking to Jim Gordon in the hospital, you can see he is gone off the deep end. Or before that when he is going to kill an insane henchman of the Jokers, flipping a coin to decide his fate, I thought that was the most disturbing moment in the movie. Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Maggie Gyllenhaal and every other actor actor involved are handle themselves greatly, there isn't a weak actor in the cast.Finally, after watching the film several times more, I finally see the greatness in the Joker. I have never seen Mr Ledger in another film before, so I couldn't appreciate how deeply he sunk himself into the role. The physical transformation is astounding, and he does play an insane mastermind to the absolute T, even if he doesn't seem right in a ""realistic"" world frame. He is charismatic and will certainly be remembered, and I see him as a Mephistopheles type character. Batman has always been a mythical story at heart, so why not embrace it? Congrats on your amazing performance Heath, you played pure evil and insanity in a great way, and I hope you somehow know how many fans you have down on Earth.I also give my heartfelt praise to the director, screenwriters(director Chris Nolan and his brother), cinematographer and everyone else involved. The movie has great dialog, a great and consistent plot, is a wonder for the eyes and is just fantastic all around as it explores different themes like pure evil, morality, order, human nature and more. It is not the best film I have ever seen, but it is a very respectable effort. PS I would also like to compliament the action scenes and sick humor used by the Joker. The Dark Knight also works perfectly well as a straight action picture for those without minds(just kidding). It is just as exciting as the best action movie ever, Die Hard and the Jokers dialog, while twisted by his evilness, is also very funny"
7379,True,"The scene about killing off the other heist men, the money The Joker was stealing from the bank was not for his own use in the first place, he was stealing drug money that belonged to the mafia, and that Asian dude. This is why he goes to the mafia for help and this is why he doesn't want to share the money. This also answers why he was able to get so many accomplices, since the accomplices were either part of the mob(in which they were doing it to get their money back) or mentally ill people, (the man who Harvey Dent was about to kill in the ally, and the man with the bomb inside him in the jail). As for ""why did the cops not notice that The Joker was dressed as a cop in the scene with the mayor is because all of the other people weren't cops either, they were goons. Notice how there were about ten cops tide up and stripped when Batman saw them. The hospital was the only scene i couldn't figure out especially since their was no way for the Joker to have pre-lay the bombs before knowing what Hospital Harvey was at.As for the movie itself, the only thing I didn't like was Batman's raspy voice, it made it hard to understand some of the dialogue. I also think that Heath did too good a job acting that he stole the light whenever any other actor had a major role on screen. I specify major, because those few scenes when batman entered unexpectedly were great and shined light on the batman again.If this movie didn't include batman, and was written using characters from Batman, more people would be calling it a masterpiece. Because I think long time fans of Batman man were probably disappointed that it didn't keep with some of the humor that is associated with comic books, and the cartoon, and Tim Burton's earlier films.On the other side of the fence are the people who loved the original Batman cartoons comic books etc..., and they love the fact that Nolan and his brother put so much thought into the new direction they took Batman. In thinking through, if Batman were real, how would people react, how would a completely psychotic villain (aka The Joker) think and act in a real world setting. The results of Nolan's brainstorming open light to very plausible outcome if such a hero were to exist.The story was simple, but told in a complicated way. A psychopath steals drug money to build a gang of goons to fur fill his plan of corrupting a city, to prove his point that everyone is just as sick as he is, but a Hero, who is trying to give the city a real hero (aka Harvey Dent), tries to get rid of this villain, without losing what he fights for. It was told extremely well, and all thought with a run time of over two and a half hours you would think it would be drawn out, it was extremely well paced, especially when compared to ""Batman Begins"".The movie was performed well,The Joker being the only exception who was performed perfectly, told well, and filmed brilliantly, it certainly deserves to be called a masterpiece, and is in my top ten just below Forrest Gump and just above Shawshank Redemption. The 10 stars really should be 9.8 but i cant choose that"
7380,True,"This is without a doubt the best Batman movie ever! The best comic book movie ever! (Iron Man was close second) I would go as far as to say this is my new favorite movie of all time! That coming from a gore hound horror movie fanatic. I grew up with Batman. He has always been my favorite hero and the Joker has always been my favorite villain so much that I have the famous scene from Batman the killing joke tattooed on my chest. Comic book fans you know the one I'm talking about. The previous Batman movies were a kick in the crotch slap in the face. Anyone who says Jack Nicholson made a good Joker needs to be beaten severely. Jack made a horrible Joker, he didn't look like the Joker and more importantly didn't act like him either. Take Heath Ledger he read the proper comics to pull of the role. Sure his skin wasn't bleached and his hair was permanent green but the idea, the portrayal of the character was true to form. To be honest I never thought much of Heath Ledger before this films it pains me because he did such a fantastic job. I never thought it was possible to pull off that role with out entering the realm of camp.Christian Bale was phenomenal as Batman he was the perfect choice for revamping the franchise, the other guys Keaton, Clooney Kilmer good actors but not for this role. Batman needs to be brooding and dark, but at the same time he needs to as Bruce Wayne convince the outside world that everything's hunky dory in richville. Bruce Wayne is the act Batman is the real person. If you read the comics Batman always refers to himself as Batman not Bruce Wayne. This movie proves that with very subtle scenes that you have to watch closely to get. I was impressed with begins but blown away by the Dark Knight. Anyone reading this go see it forget that Tim Burton even exist (the no talent Hack!) and see this movie."
7381,True,"I'm no major authority, but I have followed the Batman character across multiple formats (even the camp TV series as a kid). To me this is the real Batman that Kane invented. Too often Batman is shown/written/spoken about as a pure vigilante. In this film, despite all the effects etc. we see some of the intelligent driven detective, the selfless public servant (of sorts) and the dark core of his broken psyche. In Burton's original and Batman Begins I like the dark yet virtually always in control intelligent character, but in this film, for me, he really comes alive. Mainly because of the humanity of the performance. His dual persona's are highlighted by his love for Rachel in both identities, by the knowledge that as Wayne he can't beat Dent's good guy charisma and as Batman he can never be a lover to her. His choice of the good guy over the girl highlights that regardless of his personal feelings, his higher calling to fight crime (and to a lesser extent his seeing Dent as his way out of being Batman) is his overriding concern.Eckhart is probably a loser in this, in that no matter how well he plays Dent he's up against two of the best actors of their generation. You can pretty much see how his descent into madness and the Two Face persona occurs without feeling that it's contrived or underplayed. You know the Joker is already insane and Wayne/Batman is just this side of the line, but you see in Dent how a psyche can go from virtually one extreme to the other so quickly and so believably.But in the end, the Joker is the main act here. He doesn't take the whole show from Bale, because to me, many forget that Bale is in effect playing two characters (and to a lesser extent Eckhart). But because he is such a well written character and the fact that both the writers and the actor seem to clearly understand the Joker, he is the strongest single character. The key to the Joker is his lack of limits. Anyone who has read the Dark Knight Returns, or more appropriately The Killing Joke, will see a villain who has no moral compass in any way shape or form. He does what he does because he enjoys it. He has no desire for money or power, no revenge motivation, no love interest. In his sick, brutal and twisted way he is just having fun. He's the ultimate sado-masochist. I think Ledger got that the guy is insane, he is twisted and he is amoral, but most of all he gets that the guy does it purely for the enjoyment.It may not be considered by many to be the best film ever. I think it's classification as an action movie (some times I really hate the pigeon holing of movies like this) undermines it's impact as a well written, well imagined, well filmed and above all, well acted spectacle. I wonder how next one can even hope to top this?"
7382,True,"Wow...How should i start..my God... i did not see this coming! i've always been a fan of batman, since i was a kid..even though i must admit some of it's movies were rather disappointing..i always thought that they never portrayed him properly on film..and in the last decade numerous superhero movies were banging on the box office, movie by movie..year by year...i thought there would be no hope for Batman i never really saw batman begins properly..so i wouldn't know what to say about it.. but then this came along, i was hell excited when i first saw the trailers and the adds..its looked amazing, but trailers are trailers... then came along the tragic death of Heath Ledger. The movie release got postponed. When it finally got released, the hype was insane, the box office numbers were mind blowing, to myself i said it must've been all the hype of Heath Ledger's death and that's bringing this movie to it's success.. but when i saw it...wow...wow...i could have never been more wrong.. putting aside me being batman's fan, i am also quite the critic, i've seen my share of movies and know which ones are good...and which ones suck.. this one was ..amazing, it totally surpassed all the hype!! it truly did.. me and my friends literally had goosebumps 10 mins after the movie was over. 5 things i'd like to say about this movie..1. Cliché: Heath Ledger was undeniable Brilliant. i would've never thought he would be up to the role, as i thought Jack nicholson did an amazing job as well....he owned the role. From his body language to the constant licking of his lips was just sheer brilliance.2.Aaron Ekhart and Christian Bale Both were brilliant along with Morgan Freeman to complete the set.3.Christopher Nolan along with the writers are the people i'd love to credit most because, the story, dialog, etc were by them, u can't act out anything without a script. one of the best I've seen.4.One reason why this movie was so great was, its the first superhero movie which has a mature atmosphere to it as well as intelligence. another thing was this , let's admit is the most realistic superhero movie evermade. its good to have a superhero movie with a serious plot, one kids and grownups can both enjoy. The action scenes would drive kids nuts. 5. This wasn't just a superhero movie. It had elements from thriller, suspense movies and so on. Christoper Nolan along with his actors especially Heath , was the main reason for this. Im tired of cheesy superhero movies. i think most of us are. its good to have a change.Dark Kight just, didn't stop getting better. Through parts of the movie, i told my self that, that was it, it'll just stop there it can't get any better, but it just did. it kept getting better and better, and i swear not one part of this movie nor one second bored me. Seriously. Truly a dream a come true. Amazing. one that will be remembered. i know i will.. R.I.P Heath Ledger."
7383,True,"You know how they say that where there is smoke there's bound to be fire? Well, sometimes it is just some moron smoking ...I went to the movie theatre with the best mood ever. I was happy, I had just eaten a nice meal, I had my soda (no noisy food of course), I had the best seat and I was in one of the best theatre rooms the city has to offer. So there I was, waiting a few moments more to see the best movie ever made. That is what I was thinking, that I went to see the most thrilling, clever, funny, serious, and deep movie ever made. I went to see spectacular performances, incredible gadgets, smart weapons and lots of witty dialogues. I WAS waiting after all for 3 full years to see this movie!!!All I got ... was a 7 The Dark Knight was a bit of a snoozer. All this wait for this? All this anticipation for that? All those numbers for THAT? It was as good as Superman Returns and as boring as Spiderman II.Well don't get me wrong. It is a good movie. It has spectacular moments, it has good actors and an interesting villain. But, there were long periods of time were I was literally falling asleep with my eyes open. Some moments were frightfully boring.Another thing, story wise, this Joker had little to do with The Joker in the comics. The real Joker wears no make up, he is deformed, his skin is bleached after an accident with chemicals. The Joker commits crimes with countless ""comedic"" weapons, which very little we saw in this film. Well this was a fine version, but I prefer the story in the comics so I would preferred it if they'd stick to it. Though they kept certain aspects of The Joker, like for example the fact that ""he was lying so often about his former life that he himself is confused as to what actually happened"" I would love to have a bit more of that. The Joker has some really smart and interesting stories about his past. In The Killing Joke especially.""Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another... if I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!""But anyway, this was not the problem with this movie. This is just an observation and a personal preference. There were other aspects that made this a good movie but definitely NOT a masterpiece. Heath Ledger, may he rest in peace, was good but not spectacular! Most actors could pull this part through (unless it was Keanu Reeves lol) And even if I accept him as The Joker I still prefer Jack Nicholson for this part, an actor with more experience and class. Christian Bale looked as if he was bored through the entire movie. He was gray through and through. Plus his voice annoyed me a bit. I got used to it but it was rather ridiculous. Something between Barry White and a lesbian truck driver. (for the record, I have no issues with Mr Barry White or lesbian truck drivers, as long as they don't try to imitate Batman) There was no depth in the story and the moral meanings were a dash tedious. But there were as I said spectacular moments. Mostly visual though. The scene where the batmobile transforms was unfortunately the only clever ""gadget moment"". I was excepting much more. This is batman after all and since he has no superpowers this is what we all expect from him, clever gadgets. Well there was not much of that. There were too many long chasing scenes, which made the movie seem too long. And when one feels that a movie is too long, most of the times it means it is rather boring.I am now convinced that the whole racket about this movie had to do with Heath Ledger's death. Otherwise, there is NO explanation why this movie is on top in IMDb. I find it offensive and sacrilegious for this movie to be on top of The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption. I find it offensive even seeing it on top of Batman Begins, which, for my humble opinion, is the best superhero movie ever made. And after that is X-Men and then X-Men II.The Dark Knight is just a good movie. It is a hard solid 7. No more , no less..."
7384,True,"Believe the hypeThis IS the Movie of 2008. No question about it. Maybe even one of THE best movies of all time. In fact, it's not just the movie of the year, The Dark Knight is now a milestone in cinema history. It will change how future summer blockbusters will be made.Every Hollywood film maker in the world should now have this mother of a movie in the back of their minds when creating their new movie. Trying to work out what on earth Christopher Nolan did to make not only a fantastic summer blockbuster, but a brilliantly written, brilliantly acted and brilliantly intelligent masterpiece.With The Dark Knight, it's hard to decide where to begin explaining why it's so amazing and why it's one of the finest films ever made. But, we've got to start somewhere so I'll start with my favourite element of the movie: The Joker.The Joker is not only now my favourite movie villain of all time, but he's also now one of my favourite movie characters of all time, up there with Arnie's T-800 and Weaving's Agent Smith. The character is all what you would want from a movie villain. He's scary, DISTURBINGLY scary, he's funny, DISTURBINGLY funny, intelligent and very witty. But what is also very intriguing and very important is that he has no motive. He doesn't want money, He doesn't want revenge. All he wants, in the words of Michael Caine, is to ""Watch the world burn"", and he doesn't care who he hurts or what he does to accomplish his goal. There's just SO much more to talk about with the Joker, i.e. the make-up, the costume, the dialogue and his memorable scenes that you could fill an entire page with detail, but I need to talk about everything else as well so unfortunately I should move on. One last thing though about the Joker. I think it's a massive shame that the actor portraying the Joker, Heath Ledger, died shortly after filming, because I'm sure he would had had a fantastic career ahead of him and is sure to win Best Actor at the next Oscars.Lets move on to Batman himself. The character of Bruce Wayne and Batman are pretty much the same as they were in Begins, only they've obviously learnt a lot over the time that has past. With the character of Batman, it's great to see that he's still developing his suit and gadgets and is in progression of fighting crime, not just Batman fighting a super villain over a clean city. His new suit is awesome, his Batmobile looks better than ever and the Batpod is just incredible.As you may know, The Dark Knight has two villains: Joker and Two-Face. When I first heard that they were having two villains, I immediately assumed that Two-Face's reveal would be left until the end of the movie and that we would see him as the central villain in the third film, similar to how Begins ended with the Joker card. How wrong was I! Two-Face, or Harvey Dent, is a very important character throughout the entire film and is portrayed brilliantly by Aaron Eckhart. The face make-up and CGI used to create the 'Two-Face' are phenomenal and the whole use of the two headed coin flipping is brilliant. It's hard to believe that Tommy Lee Jones played the same character in Batman Forever as Eckhart's portrayal is a massive contrast! I'm really glad Nolan didn't leave his reveal for the end, as I don't believe the character could match up to the Joker in a third film and don't think he could hold the villain role on his own.There are so many great and different characters in The Dark Knight it's impossible to go into detail about every one, but here is a quick run down of all the other notable characters. Maggie Gyllenhaal, who portrays Rachel Dawes, is probably the weakest actress and character in the film. She isn't awful, but compared to the rest of the cast she is the weakest. Michael Caine gives a great and funny performance again as Alfred, Morgan Freeman does what he does best as Lucius and Gary Oldman returns as Gordon, the only clean cop in Gotham.There are so many memorable scenes in the film, but a few that are definitely worth mentioning are the opening bank scene, the Batmobile/Batpod chase, Two-face's burn, reveal and coin tossing, every scene involving the Joker (especially the hospital sequence) and the final action sequence.After seeing a film like this, it's hard to believe that anything I will see now will surpass this. The film has surpassed all expectations and has done what most sequels fail to do frequently: Surpass the original. Not only does it surpass it, but it also introduces an entirely different style of film.The only thing left to think about now is what is in store for the third in Nolan's Bat Trilogy? What style of film will we see? What new villains will we see? The Riddler? Penguin? Catwoman? One can only speculate for now, but one thing is for sure, and that is that it's going to take something extremely special to surpass a sequel that has been ranked high with classics like The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption.Overall, The Dark Knight is one of the finest films ever made and do not let any one tell you any different until you have witnessed this masterpiece for yourself at the theatre. A MUST SEE movie for everyone!"
7385,True,"First of all we all must admit that this is the best movie in 2008 so far. The Joker is great, the cast is great, the shooting is great. But this is not a batman movie. A batman movie is a movie that the main character is the batman, not the villain. A batman movie is a movie that takes place in the Gothic Gotham City, not in Chicago. And a Batman movie is a movie that says the name 'batman' in its title. In this movie batman is not the main character, its just 'one of' the characters.But this does not mean that its a bad or average movie. It's actually one of the best movies in its kind. I don't say its an action movie because it gives messages which are really logical.But like every movie it has some mistakes. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a good actress but she is not very suitable for the Rachel part. She sort of looked numb at some parts and she really couldn't play batman's girlfriend.Also the movie was very long. 254 minutes is a lot and you might get bored at some parts.I would like to finish with just four words: ten out of ten."
7386,True,"To be perfectly honest, I'm not the kind of moviegoer who waits to see the critics' reactions or to witness the box-office numbers in order to determine if I go watching a movie or not. Usually, my mind is made up several months before the release.I love Batman movies, but I expected to wait until the DVD release of ""The Dark Knight"" to get hold of it instead of going to the theater right away. But after hearing about the numerous laudatory reviews about the movie and witnessing the box-office records being beaten one after another in so little time, you'll understand that I couldn't resist. And now being able of talking about the movie in a retrospective way, I can tell you that I would have regretted my first choice.If ""The Dark Knight"" is that much praised and that much seen, it's because it's well deserved.. Whether a moviegoer is a fan of Batman or not, whether (s)he's curious about Heath Ledger's final role or (s)he doesn't give a damn, it'a movie that can satisfy anybody, independently of what's looked for.The story begins shortly after ""Batman Begins"" ends. How much time, exactly? The movie isn't very clear about that, but we quickly figure out that there hasn't a lot of time spent between the end of the first movie and the beginning of the second one. The Wayne Manor is still under re-construction, so Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) and his servant Alfred (Michael Caine) have to live in a penthouse for some little time.Meanwhile, criminals haven't been totally eradicated from Gotham City's map. And one of them, the manic and schizophrenic Joker (Heath Ledger, in the role of a lifetime and a death-time) appears and doesn't take much time before spreading even more chaos and terror in the streets of Gotham.Harvey Dent (a surprising Aaron Eckhart) is the new district attorney in the city and his energy, his ardor, his determination and his intelligence fascinate the inhabitants of Gotham. He has fallen in love with Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), Bruce's childhood sweetheart, and he works closely with the few honest cops of the city, all personified by scrupulously honest Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman).Obviously, when you think about the Joker, you can imagine that it won't be an easy game to win. But even if you're anticipating a lot from him and his performer Ledger, let me tell you that you'll be completely spellbound once you see it for real.Many journalists and professional critics imagine that Ledger could be granted a posthumous Oscar for his performance. Even if there are a lot of movies that will be released until the ceremony, and that many great roles will be unveiled before that date, I have to say that if Ledger receives a nomination, I wouldn't be surprised at all. I can imagine many of you having a suspicious look about the possibility of seeing a comic book villain awarded with an Oscar, but believe me, Ledger's performance is breathtaking and will silence many skeptics. It's simple: Ledger didn't play the Joker, he WAS the Joker. His appearance is very convincing (thank the make-up artists), but his voice, and especially his twitches with his tongue demonstrate the whole scale of his role. It's too bad that he's dead, because Ledger had everything he needed in order to become a new Brando or De Niro.But the biggest drawback about Ledger's performance, it's that he steals almost all the publicity, while another actor who deserves some recognition is almost completely overshadowed. I'm talking about Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, transformed at the end of the movie into Harvey Two-Face. Eckhart is astounding and he also delivers the performance of a lifetime. He is completely convincing as Harvey Dent and he is even more as Two-Face. As for his facial make-up, you can see it, but you can't believe it. It completely flabbergasted me for the rest of the movie. I think that ""The Dark Knight"" deserves a nomination for Best Make-up.The story is particularly complex and the movie, with its two and a half hours, may be a bit too long. Some would say that the movie is impossible to follow, that he contains a lot of useless characters and that some scenes could have been shortened up. I shall acquiesce to these complaints, but I also think that director Christopher Nolan deliberately created a film based upon the Joker's personality: manic, chaotic, merciless and full of surprises.Nolan proves once again his great mastery of mixing action scenes with the psychological side of his characters. The cinematography here is even more extraordinary than in ""Batman Begins"". Here's another man who should be awarded with an Oscar in a more-or-less distant future.Besides Ledger and Eckhart, the other actors play their own role with professionalism. My only complaint concerns Maggie Gyllenhaal, who I think is totally miscast, especially after that Katie Holmes played the role of Rachel Dawes in the first movie. If you compare both pictures, it looks like Rachel has aged of about fifteen years between both.This film makes us realize two things. First, Heath Ledger had a lot of potential and his premature death will earn him a place in the category of the stars dead too quickly, among with James Dean and River Phoenix. Second, Ledger's performance, paired with Jack Nicholson's one in the 1989 ""Batman"" proves that the Joker is the #1 villain in all of the comic book medium.""The Dark Knight"" will probably be venerated as Heath Ledger's swan song and as Aaron Eckhart's breakthrough. It will also be probably treated as cursed, considering Ledger's death, Bale's arrest and Freeman's accident. One thing is sure, it will forever be a great movie and the immutable testament of a legend gone too quickly. Hence the saying: ""Only the good die young."""
7387,True,"OK, ignore the so called ""great opening scene"" of the bank robbery. It's good but its nothing to be spouting the word ""brilliant"" over. The 2nd scene with fake batmen is better but you don't know who the real Batman is, especially when he's talking like he's got a really sore throat or is doing an incredibly poor Clint Eastwood ""Dirty Harry"" impression.And that's what ruins his dialogue with Chief Gordon in the 3rd scene in the bank vault and in the rest of the movie in fact. Call me old fashioned but I like to be able to HEAR clearly what the lead character in a movie has to say.The movie looks OK, its suitably dark in places. The plot is average at best with The Joker robbing mob banks to get their attention so he can offer to kill Batman for half their money. Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker is unimpressive, its not this ultra-dark madman that all the critics & fans will have you believe it is. Cesar Romero's Joker was scarier than that. Jack Nicholson's Joker buries Ledger & keeps the shovel as a souvenir.Ledger's Joker is not only not scary he's also a liar who can't keep his stories straight. Like the story of how he got the scars on his face. That his father did it or that he did it to himself with a razor to appease his wife.In the scene where they are having the parade for the dead Commissionar is that Noel Fielding of The Mighty Boosh as one of The Jokers gunmen? We're shown Gordon is killed (and the movie just jumped the shark at that exact moment) and then Bruce Wayne offers to turn himself in as Batman to stop Joker's killing spree.Local District Attorney Harvey Dent organises a press conference then outs himself as Batman to the surprise of Bruce Wayne.During the prisoner transfer scene there's lots of views of Lower Whacker Drive so yet again this was filmed in Chicago and they obviously don't think anyone has ever seen The Blues Brothers. More vehicle chase and the ONLY good moment of Ledger's Joker is him demanding Batman run him down on the motorcycle then Joker is captured & its revealed Gordon wasn't really dead & he's appointed Commissionar.Telling Batman he's captured Dent & Rachel (Batman's love interest from the previous film) he then reveals where they both are so Batman can only rescue one of them. Batman goes to where he thinks Rachel is but it turns out that's where Dent is. Rachel is killed in an explosion (unfortunately her ""dead"" body blinks when we see it) and half of Dent's face is burnt (this is how he becomes Two-Face).Having distracted Batman & the Police away from the station Joker uses his phone-call to detonate a bomb inside one of his men then goes to find the Japanese Mob boss that the police had in custody.The trouble with the movie is it's at least 1 hour too long. It takes too long for Dent to become Two-Face, it takes Joker too long to put his millions of plans into action & achieve all their aims. Threatening the hospitals to allow Joker to get to Dent. The other back story (fronted by Two-Face) of 2 traitors within Gordon's unit (with the 2nd turning about to be Gordon's PA) is played alongside the main plot of The Joker trying to get people to kill each other is just one of the reasons why this movie is too long by an hour. You can't have 2 villains with 2 different agenda's. Pick 1 guy and 1 story and stick with it.In the hostage situation it was painfully obvious that the clowns were hostages as soon as Gordon looked at them through the binoculars (only a brain dead idiot didn't work THAT out in a microsecond). To have Batman attacked by dogs a 2nd time is just to return to the start of the movie (and whats the point in doing that so close to the damn ending!) and we already knew he'd improved the costume to be bite-proof so this was a pointless scene.The only really good scene in the whole movie is the reaction of the prisoners on the ferry (throwing their detonator out of the window). The conversation between Joker & Batman is too long and pointless, the movie should end right there (actually it should have ended over an hour ago but that's beside the point) but the director felt the need to close his final storyline with Gordon confronting Two-Face (not like Gordon ever did anything to Dent but why let a huge plot-hole like that spoil you dragging out the ending of your movie).Two-Face shows exactly how weak (for weak read ""incredibly crap paper thin plot idea"") his justification of taking Gordon's family is. When a villain is actually telling you the audience that his motives are crap, you (Warner Studio's) should really be considering sacking the person who wrote the script as he's completely derailing himself as having a believable motive.Two-Face shooting Batman is pointless as the audience already known his costume was upgraded with Kevlar after the 2nd scene. The ending (if you can call it that) is sheer crap. Batman telling Gordon to make Dent a posthumous hero & blame the deaths he had caused on Batman. Batman telling Gordon to send the police after him. And not finding out what happened to The Joker. An incredibly weak movie, WAY too long for its own good. Too many villains with individual story lines to follow. What little ending there is is left gapingly open to allow for a sequel."
7388,True,"I was entranced by this film and all the actors/characters...it is truly a masterpiece. I was very impressed by Christian Bale's batman; he really made batman a ""real"" man with deep levels of personality and conflicts of his own, and especially since he was not perfect as depicted in other batman films. It does not hurt that he is super good-looking either. Now for Heath Ledger as the Joker...yikes, he was very disturbing, because not only is he viciously evil, but he enjoys it....the joker is twisted beyond repair and severely clever using his powers to warp people into following his lead and become evil themselves before they can realize it. The joker unnerved me tremendously - I was more afraid of him than that chainsaw guy, because he was so fearless himself there would be no way to predict his next move. Heath Ledger was a pretty fearless actor too in order to open himself up to such a level of evil...to give such control over to it....I've never seen an actor ""go that far"" yet. All in all the story is mesmerizing and I would see it again & again as there are plenty of clues to the nature of everyday humans reflecting back at us. One of my favorite lines is when batman says ""you were so good, that he needed to know if you could fall"". It hit me like a ton of bricks, because sometimes the best of people are attacked by evil so much that they wonder why, and I got it - evil only focuses on the good in order to destroy it. I have to see the movie again in order to get more information and it seems there is something for everyone to learn here - you have to see it yourself. I loved it for many reasons."
7389,True,"Tonight I went to see the movie for the 2nd time. I do this with every movie I highly enjoy seeing the 1st time: this way I can see whether it was just a whim of excitement that got me, or the movie really was that good. This second time around, I had a good view of the acting, but most of all the story itself and the way it's directed.Enough has been said about Heath Ledger in other comments, and my opinion is these comments are right. The other characters in the movie are overshadowed by him, but certainly do perform excellently. Eckhart sublimely works up to his performance of Two-Face and does that well too, while Bale shows us a Batman who's more and more becoming aware that maybe he's not the hero Gotham needs. The rest of the characters were cast very well; I always enjoy Caine, and Gyllenhaal replaces Holmes in a very good fashion.The story itself is so fast-paced I felt like the movie had just been running for 15 minutes when the half-time break arrived. The run-time of 2.5 hours is certainly not too much for what the screen gives you. This is of course promoted by the way it's directed: the scenes are woven into each other in such a way that you'll never get bored. I can't see how the scenes could fit any better than this.The excellent story combined with amazing pacing and directing, and the presence of this wonderful array of actors all a perfect match for their roles results in what I think is the best movie I've seen so far in my life. As a final note to this movie, I'd be surprised if this one doesn't receive at least some nominations for the academy awards. Seeing it win a couple would be fair the way I see it."
7390,True,"Batman Begins was an excellent film nothing to special, but a beginning none the less for Batman. Now with the same cast and crew excluding Katie Holmes and adding Maggie Gylenhall the film ""THE DARK KNIGHT"" is in a league of its own. I can only remember once ever walking out of a film just feeling blown away and that was to the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy. I came out of the Dark Knight in awe of what they have created from the directing to the acting to the musical score to the cinematography and so on and so forth. The story is so relevant to today's age and there are so many references to what the world is becoming. Its all in the script listen carefully. Christian Bale is wonderful as the hard headed hero, Maggie Gylenhall does a great job as Rachael Dawes as I believe Katie Holmes did as well, they both brought something special to that character. Micheal Caine Is wonderful as Alfred Pennyworth always thats all I have to say about him. Aron Eckhart Is fantastic as Harvey Dent/Two face a very powerful performance. But of course the real star of the show is none other than Heath Ledger as the Joker. I will be honest with you I've never seen a performance as amazing as this. He was so terrifyingly shy in real life and to have created a character so intense and horrific, is beyond me. The joker is psychotic, fearless and merciless and what late Mr Ledger did was create history and reach insanity for this part. I believe he dug to deep into the joker and lost his sense of reality which eventually killed him. He will certainly be remembered for his excellence and commitment to acting, a legend in my eyes. If you haven't seen THE DARK KNIGHT, I would advise you to attend, its simply superb.............Paul"
7391,True,"-----spoiler within------ I don't know if you will like this review but I tried my best to deliver what I want to say (Actually it's just some words) about movie and what is the movie???? ""THE DARK KNIGHT"" (after I saw itit's my best movie of all time) some of you may say; what the hell you are talking about ,,where is the 'THE GODFATHER"" , well THE GODFATHER was my best movie of all time and I thought it will never change but what happened is a miracle.Batman Begins was the best comic-book film ever and it was one of the best C.Nolan's films (actuallyexception of his debut film, Following¸ the man has never made a movie that didn't end up on IMDb top movies list, and my top ten list) , and comparing BB to TDK , BB look like an opening scene for TDK, it's really that's epic. TDK is epic, dark, emotional, that you don't want this movie end, you feel the chill from the beginning to the end, every scene is a gem to surround the crown (the film) , thanks from all my heart and the people who waited this movie and got what exceeded the world's imagination, thanks to whole crew from the director to the last person in this franchise .All the actors did memorable acting and I salute them for that,"" Bale""(my favorite actor because his capability mentally and physically) the only actor who justify Bruce Wayne Batman, ""Oldman"" makes you believe that they clowned Gordon from the comic, perfect, ""Caine"" the father Bruce didn't have and the adviser for him , ""Eckhart"" the white knight, the real Two-face, better than Tommy lee  hell yes,100000000000 times, the new face Maggie Gyllenhall who beautifully portrayed the love of Dent and Bruce ,she brought more softness than Kate,"" Freeman"" the thinking man for Wayne's company and Batman's supplier for gears and gadgets.And Of course the Oscar-worthy actor the late ""Heath Ledger ""who didn't just portrayed The Joker, he portrayed pure evil, chaotic , psychopath, Mass murderer and the bad ass villain of all time, the whole film I tried to find one proof that this guy wearing Joker make up is Heath but I couldn't ( you can't of course, Heath didn't locked up on himself month for nothing ) he bounded with the character like magnet, every scene he stole the show and every scene is a star on this movie ( my favorite scene is the pencil trick ) can he win an Oscar ???? Not just the Oscar, he must win every award known to human, he devoted himself to this role like he knew that he is going to die. (After Heath's performance as The Joker I am sure that any body will take his role will be in his shadow and will never top him, only if GOD will)Is it better than THE GODFATHER??? For me yes...But why??? THE GODFATHER is classic, original; you don't feel that you see a movie you feel this is a true story and you fell what the feel and the actors were the best of the best of their time Now let's try that with TDK ,it's not classic but it well be with time ,original ,story that make you think Batman is on earth and living with us ,the atmosphere of the movie the screen writing the unbelievable acting, the phenomenal job Director , the great composers Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard how brought the real theme and the hunting music to this movie and make it epic and dark ,they really knew how to deliver a score about evil, chaos ,distraction ,hope ,courage, love, Hero, sacrifice and reality.When you see TDK you don't see the comic superhero colorful and no-body-die thing, no here you see the real world of crime ,blood ,bombs ,the world is burning here, there is scene where Bruce telling Alfred : ( there is people dying Alfred what you want me to do ) or something like that , I mean this is not for kids, it's for adult , the plot will not be easy for the kids under 16 or even 18 to understand ????? I don't know what to say but this is will be on top of the movies for a long time, I hope, maybe till Nolan tell us that he will complete the trilogy and that will be such a risky move by him because I don't know how can he tops this movie but I hope he do and break the dreaded comic-book film trilogy curse.About the rating of ""IMDb's"" 250 film of all-time, as someone wrote: TDK will most definitely slide down the list. Why??? Because the jealous fans of movies that are in the top 10-20 will not like that TDK has bested their favorite movies, and these losers will spend the next weeks making multiple accounts and constantly voting the movie 1/10, this people will make it their life's job to find anyway possible to lower TDK's raring and bring it down. And I say to them what ever you do or what you going to do THE DARK KNIGHT HAS WON ,and it has dethroned THE GODFATHER as the #1 IMDb movie of all time , if only for a couple of days . There is NO OTHER movie done that, and it's the first movie of all time to cross more than $300 million in less than two weeks, and after TDK done his mission, KNOW WE (THE FANS) MUST CONTUNIE OUR MISSION BY SUPPORT THIS MOVIE AND SAVE IT FROM THE LOSERS WHO WANT TO BRING THIS MOVIE DOWN.Thanks and excuse my English."
7392,True,"This is only the second film I've reviewed that I've given 10 stars to, and to be honest that is mostly based on Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. In some ways I feel the film has suffered as a result of Ledger's death and all the hype around this portrayal and you cannot help but ask, how much of the adulation and the Oscar rumours are due to his untimely death back in January. That said, I've been looking forward to seeing this film since I Ledger's death and the comments on his performance, particularly from Michael Caine - some of the praise from such an established actor about someone still so fresh, relatively, is staggering.I was absolutely delighted by Ledger's performance - that at least wasn't ruined by all the hype. His psychotic hilarity is delicious. The disappearing pencil trick is quite horrific, the more so because of the intense, aggressive indifference he manages to conjure up. But for me (and I urge everyone to look out for it), that defining moment of the performance is the video that Alfred and Bruce watch together: the strangled roar ""LOOK AT ME!!!"" is so unnerving it defies belief.In summation, I think this is a fantastic film. It lives up to the ambiance of its predecessor, and I believe Ledger's cult status is well deserved. Go see it and enjoy it, I promise you won't be disappointed!"
7393,True,"Holy Cow! Batman's back! And this time its not only our Caped Crusader who gives an explosive performance, but believe it or not his arch-nemesis, The Joker(wonderfully, unimaginably, brilliantly portrayed by the Late Heath Ledger) is the actual show stealer. The movie keeps you hooked on to the screen from the very beginning till the credits start rolling. Christopher Nolan Proves it yet again that when it comes to movie making, he is THE Best!!!(Memento, Batman Begins & The Prestige proved it too) But The Dark Knight surpasses them all. With the kind of standard Batman Begins put, it was inevitable that The Dark Knight would deliver so much! The cast was amazing, as it is in any Nolan movie. Ledger's performance as the menacing, psychotic, scary, and every other word that can be used to describe a mad-man, was way, way, beyond amazing. Christian Bale's role as the multi-billionaire Bruce Wayne and as the Dark Knight was a hundred times better than any other person who have portrayed Batman.(No offense to Keaton, Kilmer, Clooney) The supporting cast was undoubtedly fantastic. Maggie Gylenhall added a lot of substance to the character of Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart was simply outstanding as Harvey Dent and the Two-Face. Sir Michael Caine, well, was as usual as his very great self as Alfred. Morgan Freeman put a lot of substance to Lucius Fox. Gary Oldman gave a stunning performance as Lieutenant and later on Commissioner James Gordon. Special effects were ground-breaking. Edge-of-the-seat chase sequences were one among the the many best parts of the movie. Also, Batman returns with a much more gritty and bone-crunching style of combat. Bottom line: A must see for any die hard fan of the Batman franchise, for those who wished that Batman Begins could have been better, to those who do not want to miss Heath Ledger's last and the best performance, not only of his, but also of any actor of our time. The Dark Knight will keep you on the edge of your seat for a long, long time!!!"
7394,True,"You know the score. This film was destined to be #1 on IMDb. This film is destined to be one of the highest grossing films in years. This film is destined to be one of the ""best films"" ever.Why? Well - you know why. *wink wink nudge nudge*. The Dark Knight is without a doubt the best film I've seen this year, and in fact, a long time. Giving this work of art 10 stars would leave a bitter taste in my mouth, because I know it does have some flaws, but its a solid solid solid film. What I can say is this, is that its without a doubt, the best Batman movie that has ever been made. And thats pretty damn good in my books. Batman Begins was pretty awesome - but this film, it takes Batman Begins by the neck, pulls and tugs at it and dangles it like childs play. Simply put, The Dark Knight will go down as one of the best comic book conversions this millennium. The balance between humour, action and drama is spot on - and that makes such a pleasant change.Christopher Nolan has gone down the route of his trustworthy Bale & Caine team that he has used in his last 2 films (Batman Begins & The Prestige - both by the way, awesome films) and they still do not disappoint. Bale is the perfect Bruce Wayne, funny, diplomatic and arrogant, it was if he was born to play that role - whilst Caine, plays the intelligent yet lovable butler and close friend of Bruce, Alfred. Morgan Freeman also turns in a delightful performance as Fox, partner of Bruce in ""Wayne Enterprises"" - whilst also providing Bruce with equipment and suits for Batman.Harvey Dent aka Two-Face - is probably the weakness of this film, almost Spiderman 3 in many respects, bringing in new characters towards the end segments spoils the party, but it was a decent performance from Aaron Eckhart - don't get me wrong! I felt as if his character didn't have enough depth to it - and wasn't given enough time to develop his anger and mental image that Two-Face develops in the comics.Gary Oldman as James Gordon is also a sure fire hit. He completely knocks his Batman Begins appearance for 10, and gives us vintage Oldman.The star of the show - as you may have guessed it, was The Joker. Heath Ledger in his best role to date - and unfortunately, his last. Heath's portrayal of The Joker is dark, clever, disturbing and mischievous. The Joker appears within the first 5 minutes of the film, and you already begin to sense how it will pan out. Twists & turns all the way through. The more of The Joker you witness, you begin to realise what an interesting character he is, and how he makes Batman realise that he is just the same as him. A renagade, a vigilante, a nobody. The body language and charisma from Heath Ledger is spot on. Jack Nicholson is well within his rights to tip his hat off to Ledger, as he has done a fantastic job. Every scene with The Joker shows different sides of how fascinating an actor Ledger really was; from the delightful intro, to the ""magic trick"", the prison sequence, right through to the lorry chasing and the climax. Oscar worthy? Why not, there hasn't been a villain THIS beautifully crafted since Anthony Hopkins played Hannibal.All in all - this isn't a one trick pony - its a fantastic film in its own right. Plot twists, surprises, fantastic pace, perfect balance of drama and action. Why 9 stars? I felt it could of been darker and aimed more towards the adult fans. I felt it could have been bloodier and I felt that the Two-Face character was somewhat premature and the final Joker scene felt unfinished in some respects. I honestly think giving this #1 on our list is somewhat tedious, but it does hold its own spot in cinema history as being one of THE best comic book adaptations I've seen in a very long time. So when you put that into context, thats damn good. Heath Ledger has stamped his mark on the genre, and raised the bar so high now, you just hope that if there is a next installment, that the next villain will be able to step up to the palette. R.I.P Heath."
7395,True,"In today's day and age, superhero movies run amok in Cinemas all around the world. Just like crappy horror and action movies of the 80's, comic book movies are everywhere. From the turds like ""Catwoman"" to the decent like ""Blade"" to the classic like ""X2:X-Men United"", they have all felt like comic book movies. But there was one franchise that went from decent to horrid in a span of 8 years. It was Batman, going from ""Batman"" to ""Batman and Robin"" from 1989 to 1997. And when everyone counted out the franchise, they were in for a rude awakening.In 2005 WB and Christopher Nolan came together and made ""Batman Begins"", a movie that transcended the genre and made people clamor for a sequel. Well in 2008, Christopher Nolan returned and brought with him the old team and newcomers Heath Ledger, Maggie Gyllenhall and Jonathan Nolan. This was a movie hyped for so long because of the last one and the buzz around Ledger's performance around the Joker. Well after three years of waiting, it arrived. And the question on everyone's mind is ""Does it live up to the hype?"" Well a simple answer in yes. But it is so much more complex that that. It is not only the greatest movie of 2008 or the greatest comic book movie, it is the best movie of the decade and one of the best crime dramas ever.The movie starts right where Batman Begins ended. The Joker and his goons are robbing a bank. But this isn't an ordinary bank or robbery. During the robbery, the henchmen start picking each other off. We find out the Joker told them each to make the cuts better. But they don't he's there with them. Also, this is a mob bank. So the manager doesn't go down without a fight. He pulls out a shotgun and goes to town. But he is dispatched off and we get our first glimpse off The Joker. Things only get better from here.After the robbery, we are treated to a gang meeting. Apparently the drugs being bought have odd side effects. Turns out the dealer is none other than Scarecrow. Cillian Murphy is back, but it's only a cameo to tie this to ""Batman Begins"". This scene works very well. It shows us the fake Batmen running around. It also shows us that Batman isn't happy with his suit.Things really kick off during the meeting of the mob. All the remaining bosses met to discuss the cops recovering the laundered money, led by Lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman). They also briefly mention The Joker, but they feel he's a nobody. Then he crashes the party. He shows us a nice little magic trick and talks to the bosses. We find out he plans to kill Batman. After this scene, the movie just kicks it into high gear. I don't wanna spoil the movie for anyone, so I'll stop discussing the plot.Let's get this out of the way, Heath Ledger is no where in this movie. All we get is the Joker. It's a performance for the ages. Quite possibly the greatest performance of all time. Every scene he's in, he chews up the scenery. He's hilarious and frightening at the same time. The third time I saw it, I was still tense whenever he showed up. He's brutal, manic, psychotic, hilarious and very smart. The ultimate screen villain. He makes things harder for future Jokers.Everyone else in the movie is also amazing. Christian Bale is still the best Batman and Bruce Wayne. He is intimidating and charming. Gary Oldman is given more to do this time and he owns it. Amazing to watch as Jim Gordon, one of the only good cops in town. Morgan Freeman is still good as Lucius Fox, Bruce's source of gadgets. Michael Caine still works as Alfred. Maggie Gyllenhall is a step up from Katie Holmes but Rachel is still an annoying character.The most under rated performance is definitely Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent. He is really great in the role. He owns Harvey Dent. He starts out as the White Knight of Gotham, a really admirable man. But he slowly becomes a ruined man, culminating into his change into Two Face. It's really fantastic.One of the best things about this movie is it managed to keep me on the edge of my seat. I thought I knew what was gonna happen, but I was always pleasantly surprised. The twists and turns in this movie never felt forced or gimmicky. It was all a natural progression of the story. Same goes with the action scenes. There aren't many, but the ones there are amazing. Nolan really knows what he's doing. The action was all natural progression.This movie is a lot darker than every other comic book movie before, excluding ""Sin City"". It really kept it's promise about escalation and how things are gonna get worse before they better. It is ""The Empire Strikes Back"" of this generation. It really is amazing how Nolan and company made such a groundbreaking movie. This movie transcends the genre of comic book movie. It's the second movie to transcend the genre, the first being ""Batman Begins"". It is an epic crime drama. It really ranks as one of the best of all time. It managed to be better than the hype which was out of this world. It's my fourth favorite movie ever. Nolan is now my second favorite director ever, Heath Ledger is my second favorite actor. Oldman and Eckhart move up in my list after this flick. A once in a lifer time event. It is truly a challenge to make a third movie that lives up to the hype. Absolutely amazing."
7396,True,"The Dark Knight **WARNING: some spoilers below** I'm stunned. Films have no right being this good.I have no real words to describe what I've just seen. I can't quite process it yet. It is going to need several more screenings to unravel all of the stuff that is in that film. This isn't a superhero film...this is a complex ideas driven crime thriller about two outlaws vying for the soul of a city. One who is dedicated to preserving order but at what cost? The other dedicated to creating chaos at any cost to expose the 'true nature' of humanity and to prove a point; to push Gotham's Dark Knight and its White Knight beyond the limits. And caught in between are the mob, the police, and the people at large.Welcome to a world without rules. Indeed.It's a film about our society. About how fragile it really is. About how close we always are to true chaos and how easy it is to slip in to anarchy or do the wrong thing for the right reason. It's a film about choices.Heath Ledger...what can you say? One of THE best performances I've EVER seen. Unpredictable, insane, vile, intelligent, disturbing, blackly funny, horrific, entrancing...all at the same time. This is probably the most subtle and nuanced 'BIG' performance ever. There is so much detail and depth to it. Just give him that Oscar right now.This film was filled with so many ""Holy ....!"" moments that either made me giggle with manic glee to rival the Joker himself or made my jaw go slack or just gripped me so hard I couldn't move for fear at what was going to happen next. Too many to list them all...but the Joker's disappearing pencil trick, dropping the mob boss, flipping the truck and then Batman's quick turn from the wall on his bat bike are just a few. Oh, and the sight of the Joker dressed as a nurse is an image now burned forever in to my brain.If I had one minor criticism it would be that Harvey's downfall and descent to madness is a little to fast, but Aaron Eckhert is so good that you still buy it.**START OF SPOILERS** And what a way to end.Batman makes the sacrifice and truly becomes the outcast, the hunted. He is stripped back down to the basic essence of the character: an outlaw, a vigilante, a well intentioned criminal who is to be pursued and brought to justice by society.**END OF SPOILERS** The Dark Knight is a massive achievement. It is a film that transcends its genre roots to become something much bigger and bolder while still remaining faithful enough to be recognisable. It is quite simply one of the best films I've ever seen. Just how far up my list it goes I'm not sure. It will need a good few more viewings to unravel it all the more, but as of now...it's pretty darn high up.Stunning!"
7397,True,"I initially went to watch this film mostly to see Heath Ledger's take on the Joker. That was three days ago. The Dark Knight still haunts me now.The Dark Knight transcends the superhero genre. It's on big morality play. It's a crime drama with interesting action scenes thrown in. Admittedly though, the movie wouldn't have worked if it wasn't a superhero movie. The best aspect of this movie is the complicated plot that revolves around the Joker. We keep on guessing what his ultimate plan is, what he's going to do next, how will Batman and friends deal with him? It was so many stories interwoven that it will keep your mind occupied up to the end. One particular thing I liked is that the love triangle did not throw off an already good plot line. It rather enhanced it. The script was the best thing done here. It wasn't boring. It was complicated but understandable.The script also devoted a lot of time with the supporting characters that it felt like an ensemble piece rather than a story revolving around Batman vs. Joker. But the acting was great.A marked improvement was the better portrayal of Rachel Dawes. Maggie Gyllenhall could portray well that she carries the burden of knowing that Bruce Wayne is Batman with just facial expressions. It wasn't flat or overacted. She's not a damsel in distress either. She can take care of herself. She did manage to physically assault the Joker. She was just overpowered and captured.Christian Bale was excellent in conveying Bruce Wayne's dilemma. Yeah, he was more Bruce Wayne here than Batman. His Batman voice wasn't more menacing as the previous film. It came somewhat annoying sometimes, in a sense that it was obvious to movie characters that Batman's voice wasn't a natural one. Best entrance was the interrogation scene. It reminds us on how unnerving he is on comics on other characters, even fellow heroes.A revelation here was Aaron Eckhart. He played a perfect Harvey Dent, an ambitious and driven district attorney who only wants to do good for this city. His portrayal of Two-Face was compelling. It was a character who could not handle well the tragedy he suffered and he got that down to pat like we expected Two-Face to be. But he was better as Harvey Dent because we really liked him as a person.Gary Oldman's Gordon was a conflicted character. Gordon wants to get rid of all the criminals in Gotham. He's saddled by the fact that the police force is infiltrated by the mafia. He also keeps on scrambling to catch the Joker and prevent his plans from wreaking havoc. Morgan Freeman's Fox knows his boss is Batman and supports him 100%. But he does have his own principles and scruples and makes him more believable as a character. On the other hand, Michael Caine's Alfred stays loyal to Batman. He also has some of the best lines. His character here shortened as compared to the previous film but his presence is necessary nevertheless.I liked the crime bosses here too. You hate them at first but later they are scared of the Joker. I never really like Eric Roberts before but here, I could view his character with sympathy. They're too afraid of Batman so that they're meeting in daylight and their hoods hide upon seeing the Bat Signal.Heath Ledger's portrayal is the Joker can be described as creepy and disturbing. You'd never realize it was him. It's the best because Joker wasn't trying to be funny. He's an inscrutable psychopath who's out to create havoc for no one else knows why but him. He's also a dangerous hand-to-hand combatant and shoots really well. He planned it all from the start. He's a criminal genius out to prove that anyone can be as murderous as he is. Case in point: the ferries scene made me very nervous and didn't expect how the problem would solve itself. His hospital visit was funny but you realize that he was person without scruples. And what he said to Two-Face about not to take what he did to him personally was the best ironic statement in the movie. The Joker here was pure evil and chaos, not a clown trying to be a mass murderer. Best Actor? Definitely. A supporting actor wouldn't do him justice. His character was the centre of the movie together with Batman. He also had the best lines and delivered them with menace you'd loose bladder control if you were with him in the same room. This film ought to be best picture for many reasons. It has a superb script, amazing cinematography, appropriate score, and a great cast who could all act. But it's more than that. It haunts you and makes you giddy at the same time. It makes you want to watch it all over again. It reminds you of the Titanic bandwagon. It doesn't have the Titanic's mushiness. The appeal is more mental. It's so perfect. Oh yeah, it earned a lot. So start the buzz."
7398,True,"Director Christopher Nolan has tapped into a cultural zeitgeist with his soaring ""Dark Knight."" No other director has shown so much ambition while working within the context of such an iconic name brand belonging to popular culture. By building upon the excellent framework he set with ""Batman Begins"" and adding in the chaos of the Joker (Heath Ledger, legendary) and the tragedy of Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart, admirable), Nolan, like Hitchcock before him, utilizes a B-level genre flick to tap into our shared cultural fears. Along with his co-writer brother, Jonathan Nolan, the director crafts a tightly wound tapestry that explores our archetypal fears of losing our identity and becoming that which we hate, while tuning into post 9/11 fears of terrorism, cowboy diplomacy, wire-tapping, and vigilante justice run amok.The cast assembled falls right into place with Nolan's epic and relentlessly dark vision of our current superhero mythology. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are again perfect in their supporting roles of wisdom and gadget providers, while Gary Oldman receives a surprising amount of screen time and delivers a sterling Oscar-worthy performance as the tormented Commissioner James Gordon. Replacing the dreadful Katie Holmes, Maggie Gyllenhaal is spry and feisty as assistant DA Rachel Dawes, but still seems out of place in her role. Bale is again brooding and effective as Bruce Wayne, though he gets overshadowed by the sly trickster that is Heath Ledger's Joker. Ledger is everything he's been hyped up to be. He's scary good and his insanely nuanced and subversively humorous performance haunts the film while his character terrorizes Gotham with a feverish intensity that is divinely married to Nolan's amped up tempo of thrills.The opening moments of the film fall victim to the typical trappings of a sequel as it tries to reintroduce us to the cast regulars while setting the stage for new conflicts. However, once the Joker starts playing his games, Nolan ratchets up the tension to a nightmarish effect that will leave your pulse pounding for two hours. With each terrorist act of the Joker and ensuing catastrophe, Nolan ups the ante, resulting in a film that is enormously entertaining while also making the obvious bloated runtime seem oppressive and nerve-wracking...almost as if the film is a terrorist attack against the audience......and maybe that's the point. With the opening camera swoop between skyscrapers zeroing in on a single window taken straight from Hitchcock's opening shot from ""Psycho"", Nolan tells the audience what they are in store for. Two more images, along with Ledger's ghastly scarred and make-up covered visage, seep into the viewer's subconscious. The first is after a building is exploded we see an image of firefighters spraying water over the scalding steel left behind that is eerily reminiscent of scenes from Ground Zero. The second is after a hospital is demolished, an image of the building's carcass on the television seems taken straight from the Oklahoma City Bombing. As we watch the harrowing Joker-less climax involving Batman, Dent, and Gordon, and knowing in the back of our minds what became of Ledger in real life, we realize that terrorism can not only come from without, but from within. Sometimes we are our own worst victims."
7399,True,"I had my reservations about watching this movie, especially since I was not hugely sold on ""Batman Begins"". I had my objections with the cast upon first glance - Aaron Eckheart being too pretty a face (and just that for that matter) for Two-Face and Heath Ledger was DEFINITELY not my first choice for the Joker, cos lets face it... A guy whom girls swoon over just by hearing his voice is someone who is ill suited to play a sadistic, barbaric and nutty homicidal maniac.Yeah, thats not the case anymore.Heath Ledger - Boy was I wrong! From the moment he stepped on screen at the bank I was blown away by how evil and dark he immediately came off as. I was actually curled up and scared in my seat every time he wielded a knife, fearful for what he would do to the people he eventually killed. I laughed with wide open eyes in surprise with the jokes he pulled to kill off those in his path (""I'm going to make this pencil disappear!""). It was truly one of the best performances I have ever seen, a re-invention of the Joker that stays true to the comics and retains a constant pull on the viewer throughout.Gary Oldman - This man is pure brilliance! I really didn't know if they would kill him off or keep him alive, the silent communication between him and batman was an excellent dynamic to play off of. The last scenes in the movie had me on the edge of my seat, feeling him plead for the lives of his family - utterly heart wrenching. He truly embodies the loyalty and purity of the Jim Gordon we know and love.Aaron Eckheart - Again very glad to be proved wrong. Obviously his portrayal of Harvey Dent would be flawless, but Two-Face? Personally I was pleasantly surprised by another actor who could do evil the way he did Two-Face. Wayyyy better than Tommy Lee Jones by light years! Plot wise: Everyone goes into the movies these days with the idea that ""ooo its definitely going to work out this way"" and if they deviate from the norm, the plot is worked into a deus ex machina. Well NO!! The writers deserve every award possible for this script, every turn every move was well thought out - except for the Harvey not killing Joker thing, that was just plain... dumb.The only thing I regret about this movie is the lack of Batman. He's supposed to be the world's greatest detective and we have yet to see that in any shape or form, because he was always always at a disadvantage against the Joker and even Two-Face. Also I still am not convinced by Christian Bale (because he is just the muscle and pretty boy). And Michael Caine is too good for the role of Alfred. Still, this movie was sheer genius and I hope everyone gets every award possible for this movie."
7400,True,"Walking into the theater, I began to wonder why I had been so excited about this movieWhy for weeks, I had been spouting how amazing it was going to be. It was a black cloud moment. And I prepped myself for ""just another movie"".Leaving the theatre, all traces of such a feeling were gone, and I was left in a strange way; pondering all the things I'd just seen.Heath Ledger. Heath Ledger. Heath Ledger. I can't express what an amazing job I think he did with words. I can't not give props to the writers and Designers. it was a brilliant take on the Joker. Somewhere about half-way through, I suddenly missed Heath Ledger. that's all I can really do to explain it.Now to the one thing I really wanted to say.something. one thing. the one thing.the one thing i DID NOT (gasp here - >_____< - ) like about the Dark Knight:Michael Caine as Alfred. another thing I can't really explain, but will try to anyways.Alfred seems like so much of a softer role than Michael Caine has gone after in the past. Something along the lines of him being too strong.this. is such a minor thing, that it doesn't even scratch the surface of this amazing movie.it delivers enough fighting, shooting, and explosions to satisfy my action Thirst. but also gave enough Thought Provoking themes. (the Boats scene, and the general aim of the Joker).god bless the Dark Knight!"
7401,True,"The Dark Knight is probably one of the few examples where I am unsure how to rate it. It has awesome action sequences, rather deep plot, a charismatic villain and the charismatic hero... yet it has problem with pacing and editing. The action and suspense would come at you without pause, making everything seem erratic, and not in a good way.Maybe to be specific... those who were expecting a direction and story-telling like Begins will be disappointed. Unlike Begins, The Dark Knight is not a story about Batman, but a story of Gotham in response to Batman's arrival. The theme of escalation, the classic notion of good versus evil, chaos versus order, and what a hero truly is, is present in the whole movie... but it was rather cramped in a way that it was somewhat difficult to understand it all with just one sitting.Batman (Bale) has now been doing the job for over a year. His appearance had in fact inspired people of Gotham to be intolerable against crime... but not in the way he expected. Copy-cats ran around the streets, guns blazing and shooting criminals. Thankfully, there is a new District Attorney who is also rattling the cages as Batman is, except in the open, and with legality. The dark knight hopes that one day, Dent will finally make the difference that Gotham will no longer need its masked vigilante, and he would get back together with Rachel Dawes (Gyllenhaal, replacing Holmes for the role).But things don't go according to plan. The mob, in its last corner, calls on the services of the Joker (Ledger), who unleashes forth a crime spree of unparalleled precision and destruction that drags in almost all pivotal characters towards the end.What's the most amazing thing about this movie is how accurate the characters are portrayed in the spirit of the comics. Batman now is more involved in detective work (which other movies, even Begins, explored little to naught)... Gordon (Oldman) is now more active, and much more explored here more, portrayed as a desperate cop trying to clean the streets, but getting trapped in his own dealings... the Joker, who finally is represented right (even if he does wear make-up) not as a prankster criminal... but as a true agent of chaos.Ledger had nailed him as a definitive Joker for the live action movies. How he acts, his 'plans', even his odd sense of humor. By the pictures, you see a grungy, dirty looking madman... you'd think he'd be so serious... but he is not. I could count how many times he made me, and the audience laugh. He tells Batman the duality of their nature and relationship, even wishing how he would want to do this forever... this is truly one of the best Joker portrayals in history. Disturbing, yet funny.Another strong point of the film is past its first hour... there are intense action sequences here, showcased mostly with real sets, and not relying heavily on overused CGI. Have you seen a truck flip on its back? Beautiful. Even on its last leg of the movie, the finale was not some regular battle between the two antagonists, but one big hostage situation.Trust me... it'll be a blast to watch it.One of my main complaints is how choppy the editing seemed at times, though only for a few parts. Understandibly, they were used to push the suspense forward, but there are times where the audiences would be left off somewhat confused. Batman's voice was also somewhat grating at times (Bale should start thinking of a voice that he can use when he's doing conversations as Batman... not always growling). There was also some annoying parts where the lines were either said too fast, or muted by the music.Overall, not a perfect movie... not even a true masterpiece. Its faults are often glaring at times, and even annoying, but its out-shined by the fact on how good it delivers in the middle to the end.10/10 - You cannot go wrong with this movie. Watch it. Now."
7402,True,"Let me begin by clearing a few misconceptions about 'The Dark Knight': It is not a superhero movie and it is not just a Batman movie. You could transfer the setting, and the theme of the characters to a real-life situation, and they would behave just the same way.All right then, down to the details. First of all, this is definitely, easily, and comprehensively, the best superhero movie ever. Period. Second, Ledger is the Joker. He is the brightest star in an especially bright galaxy. Nicholson, Romero, Hamill can all fill out their retirement forms. They will never be looked upon as Joker anymore. The manic intensity, the crude yet subtle humour, the unpredictability he possesses, takes Ledger to a level higher than any villain in comic book adaptations. TDK picks up from where Batman Begins left: Batman has established himself in the criminal circles, and is now inspiring a few of Gotham's citizens to take up the fight for justice themselves. But rather than doing what he thinks they would have done, i.e., taking the legal route, raising their voice, standing up to the mob; a few take up the vigilante's mantle, trying to be Batman themselves. Enter Harvey Dent, the D.A. of Gotham, and the man who is what Batman has been waiting for so long to take over the cleaning operation of the city. Dent is the face to take Gotham out of their misery: their White Knight in shining armour. And this Knight takes the damsel with him as well: Rachel Dawes, Bruce Wayne's long-time love and childhood friend. The emotional turmoil this puts Bruce Wayne through is immense, considering that Dent is the man he was waiting for to come in, so that he could hang up his shoes and retire to normal life with Dawes. But this soon becomes the least of his worries, as the Joker, a criminal who is trying to establish himself in Gotham's underworld, takes centre stage. As he himself says, he is ""an agent of Chaos."" The lack of a background story only adds to the aura and mystery of the Joker. He blows up hospitals, kills people for the fun of it, and plays with Batman's psyche: ""You complete me"", he snarls.We also play witness to the inner turmoil of Batman. Wayne even ponders whether he is really a hero, or just a fed-up guy who wants to teach the goons a lesson by using force. During critical moments in the film, he thinks of quitting his night job as the situation seems impossible. During these times, his anchors: his butler Alfred, and Lucius Fox, his technical mentor, are the men who keep him on the course, who make him endure for the greater good.Moving to the acting department, Christian Bale as Batman puts in a great performance. He is able to transfer the turmoil of Bruce Wayne and Batman effectively onto the screen. He seems to have settled into the mould of both characters like second skin. An Oscar nomination doesn't look too far away.Aaron Eckhart does justice to both his roles: Harvey Dent, and Two-Face, though he doesn't get enough time to develop the two-face character. Maggie Gyllenhaal does a better job than Katie Holmes at playing the headstrong Rachel Dawes. Though the character is not as well sketched out as the others, but it does not act as a roadblock in the story. Batman's allies: Jim Gordon, Alfred and Lucius Fox, are extremely well played by the veteran thespians Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman.But this movie belongs to Ledger alone in the acting department. He gives the Joker a twist that will live on forever, despite Ledger's unfortunate death. He might well become the first posthumous winner of the Best Actor Oscar. Yup, Best Actor, for this movie is his swan song; a final bow before he walked into the sunset.The vision of Christopher Nolan about human psyche is terrifying and extremely thought provoking at the same time. He forces you to think in between the movie as to what you would do if faced with the situation as the characters in the film. Nolan has taken his vision of a superhero movie from Batman Begins and worked on it to give us a gem on the screen on a much bigger scale. He has able help from his brother and co-writer Jonathan Nolan; the music team Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard; and Wally Pfister, the cinematographer.Chilling to the core, it leaves you wanting more. It is one of those rare movies where you think that 2 and half hours are less. The experience is emotionally overwhelming, visually grandiose, and overall, something not to be missed."
7403,True,"This movie totally had me until the last ten minutes... where I think they blew it.Let's start with what I liked. The characterizations. First, you have Heath Ledger as the Joker. Very in line with the best of the Batman comics, such as Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Killing Joke"". He brings a manic energy to the character, as someone who could kill someone with the casualness of swatting a fly. He is a force of pure chaos, as devious as Jigsaw in the Saw movies. The traps he sets up for Batman are brilliant, a truly worthy opponent.Michael Caine is awesome as Alfred. Alfred is Batman's conscience, what keeps him from going over to the dark side his adversaries inhabit.Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon. They got it right. The Burton/Schumacher Batman movies never understood the importance of the character, but BB and TDK understand him perfectly. Morgan Freeman also did an awesome job as Lucius Fox.Now we move on to where I don't have the warm fuzzies.Maggie Glyenhall- Not as pretty as Katie Holmes, I really didn't connect with her character, and her demise didn't have the emotional impact it should have had because of it.Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman- Not as strong as he was in the first movie, probably because he got overshadowed by all these other characters. Also, his vocal changes between Batman and Bruce Wayne, his Batman voice comes off as raspy. (In the animated series, Kevin Conroy had two completely different vocalizations for Wayne and Batman, and they worked.) Aaron Eckhardt as Harvy Dent/Two-Face. His performance as Dent is brilliant. When he transforms into Two-Face, it's less convincing. Also, the CGI they used strained credulity. He looked more like a decomposing zombie than a scarred supervillian.Which brings me to the ending. I think everything was fine up until the point where Two-Face was holding Gordon's family hostage. Batman pushes Dent off the structure, and they both fall. Batman survives the fall but Two-Face dies? (Apparently?) So Gordon and Batman agree that Batman will get the blame for Two-Face's murders, so the memory of Harvey Dent will be kept alive.Two-Face is probably Batman's second best villain (after the Joker). If anything, he deserved his own movie as the chief antagonist, instead of just being killed as an afterthought. Overall, I think this movie had too much stuff going on in it. It would take one or two viewings to take it all in.Still, I recommend the movie."
7404,True,"Gotham is in turmoil. In Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne created Batman as a symbol for justice and to put fear into the hearts of criminals. By the end of the film he had succeeded, but in The Dark Knight we see that his vision has turned Gotham into an even more chaotic world filled with more crime than ever and littered with pseudo-vigilantes dressing up as Batman and unsuccessfully attempting to fight crime. The story begins briefly after its predecessor ended, opening with a bank robbery constructed by the Joker and his thugs. We are immediately introduced to how this madman works, killing off his thugs as the robbery gets closer to completion. But he's not robbing the back for the money; he's sending a message to the mob that he can take as much as their money as he wants and they can't do anything to stop him. At first Batman tries to ignore the Joker and continue his attack on the mob, but he'll soon realize that nothing is more terrifying than this completely unhinged maniac, motivated only by the desire to spread destruction.The key theme running throughout The Dark Knight is the idea of justice in a corrupt society. Wayne (Christian Bale) created Batman as a symbol of that justice, but he didn't plan on being Batman forever and he's looking for someone to replace his position as this symbol. Enter Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), the new District Attorney and Gotham's White Knight. The city sees him as a beacon of hope, and unlike Batman, this symbol is an elected official with a face everyone can look up to. He doesn't use theatrics to put fear into criminals, but he demonstrates that not everyone is corrupt and he's going to do whatever it takes to bring down those who are. Bruce sees him as the right man to bring decency to Gotham and allow him to quit being Batman and be with Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), his love who is currently dating Dent. So Batman and Dent team up, along with the morally upright Lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) to put an end to corruption in Gotham and for a while it looks like they're going to succeed.The Joker (Heath Ledger), however, refuses to let decency win out. He stands as an agent of absolute chaos and he wants to show the world that deep down, when you strip away all hope for justice, everyone is capable of destruction. To prove his point he spends the film testing these three men who show that they aren't going to back down easily. And so the battle for Gotham's should begins. The Joker constantly throws pain and aggression into the faces of this city and forces everyone to show that they are capable of unimaginable cruelty, just like he is. Batman and Gordon stand strong against this menacing psychopath no matter what the Joker throws at them, but he eventually finds the trigger in Harvey Dent that brings him down from his status as the White Knight into a frightening but incredibly sympathetic monster.In creating Two-Face, Christopher Nolan does what I think is one of the smartest moves in the history of this genre. He doesn't just throw a villain at us and expect us to be afraid of them or to sympathize with them and he doesn't have fifteen minutes introducing the character and then show us a freak accident that turns them into the villain for the rest of the film. We meet this character as Harvey Dent, a symbol for decency and get invested in him as such. I personally almost forgot what his horrible fate was destined to be throughout a large portion of the film, through the shear fact that he was displayed as such a large icon for morality. Seeing him as this makes his complete decay into madness even more devastating to the point where it brought me to tears. Aaron Eckhart's performance is absolutely phenomenal. Yes, all of the talk is about Heath Ledger, yes he was a force to be reckoned with, and yes he gave easily the best performance in the film to say the least. But Eckhart is almost as magnificent. He is terrifying after his transformation into Two-Face, but we can still see the man we came to know him as throughout the film. There is one scene in particular, before he becomes Two-Face, where we can start to see the primal aggression that is going to take control of him boiling up inside and it terrified me and broke my heart all at once.Of course with any talk about The Dark Knight, there must be a detailed discussion about Heath Ledger's performance. To say that he immersed himself into the role would be an insult to the genius that is portrayed here. His unfortunate passing isn't even a factor when saying that this performance is so far beyond flawless that it almost surpasses any expectation I could have had. His work in the interrogation scene is so real and terrifying that it would have been impossible to watch if he didn't suck the viewer in so perfectly. I mean, the Joker is nothing but pure chaos and Ledger flawlessly creates that. This masochistic, destructive force goes from being charismatically hilarious one second to immensely terrifying the next. It gets to the point where you have no idea what he's going to do next, but you know that it's going to be brilliant. That interrogation scene alone is enough to convince me that it's one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. Words can't even come close to doing justice to this man's genius."
7405,True,"Just saw the midnight release of The Dark Knight and I must say I was more excited to see this movie than any other movie I have ever seen in theaters. Expecting a masterpiece in a comic book movie is crazy, I know, but a masterpiece is exactly what I got.First off, let me just say that the acting was PHENOMENAL! Christian Bale delivers another solid performance as Batman, and we can now comfortably say that he is by far the best actor to ever play the role. At first I was upset Katie Holmes did not come back for this movie but Maggie Gyllenhall does a fine job as Rachel. Caine, Oldman, and Freeman all do a great job as role characters, as they did in the first but the best acting was by two of the new guys.Aaron Eckhart as Two Face makes Tommy Lee Jones a figment of our imagination as he blows his performance out of the water. But the real story of the night was Heath Ledger as The Joker. Sad to see him go, I am glad that he will be remembered not as a cowboy, but as The Joker. Every scene that he was in gave me the chills, as he perfectly portrayed the psychopathic ways of The Joker and really helped you understand why he does the things he does. If he does not win an Oscar for his performance it will be a major disappointment.Last on the list is the Director. Christopher Nolan(Batman Begins, The Prestige), yet again makes a brilliant movie. This movie though, is by far his best, and hopefully, he winds up with an Oscar for it. The only movie I know of that may compete is the new 007 movie, but I personally don't even think it will come close as this movie, like a said before, is truly a MASTERPIECE. Well worth the ridiculous $10 dollars I had to spend to see it and I recommend it to all audiences. 10 out of 10 stars!"
7406,True,"Just got back from the midnight showing, and this movie exceeded my expectations in every way. The Joker has quickly become my favorite villain of all time. Just wait for his 'magic trick' scene. A classic. I'm not gonna go through and say what everyone else has already said, but I will say this: POSSIBLE SPOILER: How about recasting Johnny Depp as the Joker in the next one? Him and Ledger look a lot alike, and there was only one other time (besides Ledger's performance) where I said 'this is some of the best acting i've ever seen', and that was Depp in the first Pirates of the Caribbean. I think he would do a great job, and I DON'T want to see the Joker disappear. He's far too entertaining."
7407,True,"Although I realize that movies are a subjective experience and is unique in such a way based upon our preconceived ideas and presuppositions of what may or may not be entertaining to us personally, very few movies dare take us to a place that we know instinctively is true about each and every one of us and describes it in a way that becomes a creative mirror in which we are forced to look upon ourselves, and become disgusted or intrigued.What we have is a great movie that surpasses others in respect of revealing the truth that hides beneath the veil we create to make ourselves more respectable to others and to ourselves. It's a mask that we all put on everyday to make ourselves feel better about ourselves and our integration to those we consider to be our friends, our relatives and our world.When we see the Joker, we become revolted (at least I hope so) by his maniacal desire for destruction and reckless abandon of anything good. The Joker is motivated by nothing but pure hate for everything, even himself. Hate has so filled his soul that he seems distant, but so familiar. He seems to be the antithesis of what we desire, but not so removed that he becomes a figure we cannot associate with. How do you battle that level of hatred? Tolerance is impossible to give to the intolerant. Love is a mute weapon to those that have been hardened by hatred. It is here that we find the Joker within all of us. Have you not hated? Have you not been intolerant? Are we so beyond corruption that we can't see that Harvey Dent's transformation is far too plausible in each and every one of us? The Joker simply motivated Harvey by his pain and encouraged his hatred. He transformed. We see this in Anakin Skywalker who becomes Darth Vader. We see this in many movies but not so distinct and psychologically arresting as the Joker. The Joker goes beyond the limits of reality but reveals the truth that lies within our hearts in a personal way. Our ability to hate everything and to wish hurt upon others when we are in pain. Even if you keep it hidden within, you know the capacity is there. It's not beyond us, it's with us each and every moment, and all it takes is one incident and you too become that which you hate to acknowledge is part of yourselves.Batman wasn't immune to its effects either. Hatred motivates Batman just as well as the Joker. The two become symmetrical. To fight invincible hatred, you too must become one that hates as much, or more than your opponent. We know that hatred is wrong, but it's the only weapon against hatred. You become what you fight, you become something you abhor. This is Batman's dilemma.When we look at the two ferries and their ability to destroy one another or to succumb death in the absence, do we find ourselves wishing that we had the strength not to blow the other boat to bits? It becomes fantasy that one of the boats didn't destroy the other, and we have the gall to call this movie dark? Real life is far darker that what we want to believe since we have deluded ourselves to believe that we cannot enter that realm of self denigration.Who would have thought that a fantasy movie could be as bold as to show this and under a cover of an action flick? What we are presented with is a vivid documentary of our own corruption that lies within all of us. This is where The Dark Knight treads its dark path. Whether or not the true intension of the movie was to reveal this mystery of the human condition, the brilliance of The Dark Knight shows us something that we are at once familiar with, but in many cases, as the voting suggests, we are also repulsed by it. For those people who didn't enjoy the movie, it is because The Dark Knight reveals too much truth for comfort.The Dark Knight isn't simply a great movie, it's an absolute masterpiece that is awe inspiring to those that have the honesty to look into themselves and see the revelation of their own condition and find that they too are weak and susceptible to corruption, given the right conditions. What is that condition? To either find yourself in the presence of hatred, or to be consumed by it. We can see those truths within Hitler and how an entire country succumbed into the madness of hatred. We see it more today when we see ""radical Islam"" with its complete and utter intolerance towards the west and towards others that don't align to its agendas. This is the level of hatred that replicates the ideology of Nazism in its entirety. It's there for everyone to see, but we refuse to see. We don't want to believe that that type of hatred exists and we become self deluded when we refuse to see the truth. The Joker's level of hatred exists within this world, and we face the same dilemma as Batman. Do we fight against this evil and consider it evil to battle against it? This is exactly what is happening today! It's relevant, and we wish it weren't that way, but that is exactly the point. We wish, and we become self deluded when we do, and become useless against stopping hatred from thriving. Hatred has a way of expanding, having a life of its own. The Dark Knight reveals the truth about hatred and we will either acknowledge it as being true and relevant, or dismiss it simply because we cannot tolerate that much truth being revealed.My prediction is that The Dark Knight will win at least 3 Oscars including picture of the year."
7408,True,"nop.they should stop making batman movies before making more like this.was disappointed by too many things in this movie - first of all the joker. while well acted this is just not the real one - Jack Nicholson's role was so much better... this one is just a twisted overdone ""terrorist"". yeah, you can guess it - the second thing i strongly disliked ... too much use of that t-word in recent years... and should i mention the link-the-cellphones-and-see-everything technology? too powerful and too much for a man, but for this one case we will use it and after it destroy it .... yeah ... cheesy.yeah, and the batman is running around and screaming like a dumb brute ... not exactly what he should be...many stars, nice acting, bad script and action - bad movie"
7409,True,"The Hero we wanted, the Hero we expected ,no Super Powers, no Super Villains , just two master minds ,one destroying the city and the other trying to save it, what makes The Dark Knight so different is not only its script or actors but the unique adaption of what a hero really is, this is no ordinary movie, every single cast member plays a role here, and for a minute there I thought the whole thing was real, but at the end of the movie I think we all realize that the man who stole the show is simply The Joker, I just can't believe how perfect that role was, I just can't ,if Heath Ledger doesn't get an Oscar then I don't know who will, a man who lived alone in a hotel room for a month, adapting all the characteristics of Joker, he even wanted Christian Bale to beat him as hard as he could to get the feeling of what was required from one of the scenes.The Dark Knight is a movie beyond expectations, if you haven't seen the movie already then stop reading this and go watch it now; this was an experience that I will never forget, a true Masterpiece.""Let's Put a Smile on that Face"""
7410,True,"In 2005, Christopher Nolan relaunched Warner Brothers' dormant Batman franchise with ""Batman Begins"", an exceptionally well-made film that took a realistic, detailed approach to the origins of DC's biggest hero (arguably the most popular hero in the world). Now, three years later, Nolan and his star Christian Bale return to the property, and they deliver what is perhaps the greatest superhero film ever made (and a great film, besides), one that will become the model all others will look up to.The first movie ended on an optimistic note: Batman had saved the city, and had ""really started something"", in Gordon's words: however, one tease at the end (the Joker's playing card) hinted at the violent chaos to come in the next movie. And here, Nolan delivers on that, in the form of the late Heath Ledger, in a performance that is already becoming legendary. Gordon closed the last film with a prediction that Batman's presence would lead to escalation in the criminal community. He was right. The desperate Gotham mafia (a coalition of Slavic, African-American, and Italian gangsters) turn to the Joker to deal with Batman before he brings them all down. The Joker enacts a campaign of terror designed to smoke Batman out: the caped crusader and his chief allies, DA Harvey Dent and Police Commissioner Gordon (the first film's Commissioner Loeb is among the Joker's first victims), along with assistants Alfred Pennyworth and Lucius Fox, must deal with this embodiment of chaos. Dent, as well, is romancing Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, a superior replacement for Katie Holmes).Nolan and his screenwriters draw on several different comics sources to create their vision of Batman, the Joker, and Gotham. The most obvious among these are Alan Moore's ""The Killing Joke"" (perhaps the seminal Batman vs. Joker story) and Jeph Loeb's ""Batman: The Long Halloween"", which involved Harvey Dent and the struggle between Batman and the mob. Moore's Joker was conceived of as having no fixed origin, and Nolan follows throuhg with this: the Joker has no origin, though he offers several different versions to different people.Conversely, the film diverges noticeably from the comics in its depiction of Two-Face. There is no split personality in evidence, nor any of the psychological problems that said personality springs from. Two-Face has more or less been cut down to his gimmick, and then a new rationale for the gimmick constructed to suit the themes of the film. Eckhart is very compelling as this version, which also sports some effectively grisly makeup/effects.""Batman Begins"" was notable for being the first Batman film to really be about Batman, instead of being a showcase for various freakshow villains; this is dialled back a bit in this film, where the villains take more of a centre-stage. Batman still has a significant character arc, but the story is less about him; notice that the buzz surrounding the movie centres on Ledger, not Bale. That Batman is less of a focus is not a bad thing in and of itself, so long as the villains are well-done, which they are. Caine, Freeman, Oldman, and Gyllenhaal are all effective supporting cast.One of the most notable things about this film is its ability to make the audience doubt the outcome, bringing the storytelling styles that have flourished in the comics industry for at least twenty years to the big screen at last; Spider-Man succeeded in 2002 where he failed in the comics in 1973, but now the audience is never sure whether Batman's allies will reliably make it out alive. It's a jolt that one hopes will allow future comics adaptations to reach the greater diversity of outcomes that the comics currently enjoy.A bravura effort from all involved."
7411,True,"First of all so many here are praising this movie as it is the best movie ever. For me, I don't rate it like that. It was an okay to good movie.I rate it 6 out of 10. And here are the 4 missing points of the movie: 1.) They changed Katie Holmes in the movie to Maggie Gyllenhaal. Katie Holmes did extremely well in the first part as Rachel Dawes. I would've preferred Katie than Maggie.2.) Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent who transformed to Two Face. When his half of face was burnt, how can he talk normal when his face was showing some skeleton and not even feeling any pain at all?!?!?!?! That really made me wonder why :S 3.) Why was Cillian Murphy AKA TheScarecrow in the first scene and didn't act throughout the movie as one of the enemies? 4.) The Joker did a good job but not too perfect. But then again, why would everyone think that no one could do it better than him? Of course every actor can. That's my personal point of view. And hypothetically speaking, ff he was to be nominated and win the Oscar, it would be because of so much sympathy.All in all, an ""OK to GOOD"" movie."
7412,True,"I watched the first of the trilogy yesterday, Batman Begins and thought it was a great film. So i watched this today and felt compelled to write a review. I have never reviewed any film before. My problem is with the Joker and instead of the one or two quick lines we are used to from the joker in previous films and the series, we are treat with a freezing of time while the joker bores us with a minute plus of not very well delivered boredom and the other character in the scene keep silent and listens. This happens all the way through the movie and ruins it. I had heard people rave about heath ledgers performance but they must be young uns who didn't grow up with the American series and then jack Nicholson's excellent portrayal. It was basically a toned down bad copy of jn. Now i know its fantasy and we have to stretch our imagination but there was a point in the film where i nearly turned it off as it simply was beyond belief. Dents loved one has been killed by the joker and he has a gun pointing at him and doesn't kill him. WTF? Heath ledgers dialogue probably bored him into a coma or sent him to sleep. But there is no way if you loved someone and had their killer at your mercy and you had already shown in the film that you were prepared to take a life that you wouldn't have killed him. Sorry i could not get over that. Especially after that point Dent then kills people who were peripheral to Rachels death!!! How the film gets 9/10 on here i haven't a clue. Come on people how can you paper over a massive plot hole like that?"
7413,True,"It appears that Nolan has done it again. One of the most consistent, top quality directors, he continues his unblemished record with another stunning entry into his cannon.The Dark Knight follows on and, in many ways, betters his first outing Batman Begins. With his first batman film, it was clear that Nolan has emphasis on character development, so much so, that it takes a full hour before batman even dons his cape and rides the bat mobile.Naturally with the character already developed, he appears relatively quickly in The Dark Knight, but this only allows Nolan greater scope to delve further into the Bruce Wayne/Batman psyche. If the first film was about defining batman, this one is about his conflict.And this is what i believe is the best part about the dark knight. There have been some complaints that the whist the film is 2 1/2 long, there is little by way of actual plot - true, but what really drives this film is how all the events play on Bruce Wayne's mind. Nolans choices of villains are also clever in the way define batman. In his fist film Ras Ah Gul (?) helped create him, in this film the joker(a masterstroke of Nolans to cast Heath Ledger in his Oscar winning role - who would have thought?)is to test him. The ultimate question for Batman is - at what price does he have to pay to be batman?? But this being a batman film, there is no shortage of action and tension, right from the opening heist, no doubt a nod to Michael Mann's heat (even with the casting of William Fitchner) to the stunning chase through the underpass of Gotham. The film is so technically flawless, edited and shot with as little use of CGI as possible, a positive in my book as ""real"" stunts always give and immediate and more heart pounding result than any CGI can do.All performances are pretty much spot on, with Maggie Gyllehall a marked improvement on the light-weigh Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman - a contender for best on ground as Gordon, and Bale - solid as always. Caine and Freeman are more or less on autopilot.But this is Nolans film. He knows what works and few directors can put all the ingredients together the way he does. His commitment to story and chaster as well as the visuals is what sets him, and his movies apart.I can only hope that ""the Dark Knight Rises"" can complete what he set out to achieve with the batman mythology. If this is movie is anything to go by, then we are in good hands."
7414,True,"'The Dark Knight' is a dazzling epic filled with excellent performances and incredible action sequences. It is a triumph on pretty much every front and, while perhaps it does not quite reach the dizzy heights of director Christopher Nolan's more recent 'Inception', it still packs a mighty punch.Christian Bale reprises his role of billionaire industrialist Bruce Wayne whose alter-ego, the superhero Batman, is the 'dark knight' of the film's title. Bale really captures the torment of Wayne; he is still clearly haunted by the cold and heartless murder of his parents all those years ago. And it is a real treat to see Eric Roberts as a slimy crime boss named Salvatore Maroni. But the real scene stealer here is the late Heath Ledger as The Joker. Ledger plays him as an unpredictable and dangerous psychopath and never overdoes it or chews the scenery for a second. The other actors - as good as they are - do not stand a chance when Ledger is on screen; he steals every scene that he is in.The film features a spectacular car chase in which an eighteen-wheel rig is flipped right over lengthwise, and Nolan has assembled a dream cast which includes Maggie Gyllenhaal as Bruce's love interest Rachel Dawes, and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent. This reboot of the 'Batman' franchise which began with 'Batman Begins', also directed by Nolan, is a resounding success. There is darkness but there is also light, as the result of the ferry standoff in the film's third act demonstrates. 'The Dark Knight' is a brilliant and well-constructed film which just keeps on getting it right."
7415,True,"I would like to start this out by stating that I LIKED Batman Begins. I felt that the whole entrance to attempt to make things ""logical"" and ""realistic"" (as far as comic book movies go) was refreshing and adult. Its difficult as an adult to easily suspend disbelief or compensate loopholes with imagination where there exist such obvious loopholes sometimes. Sometimes you need more ""detail"" in the story to make it better in some places... I felt like this was one of those movies: Convoluted, ill-paced, and at times, ridiculous. Even for a comic book movie.What was good enough about this movie that I rated it a 4? It was ""cool"". I enjoyed the effects and at minimum was entertained (started shifting in my chair 3/4 through though, after beginning to notice how long I have actually been sitting there...not a good feeling for watching an ""epic movie""). Loved the bike, loved the car, LOVED Heath Ledger. He was brilliant....I WILL defend his ""smacking lips"" that some are actually filtering into the ""bad"" aspects of this. Here's a hint: IT IS SUPPOSED TO ANNOY YOU! He's a madman with ticks, quirks, and no doubt the smacking was created (and obviously deliberately emphasized) as something that was created from the cuts on the character's lips. I forgot he was Heath Ledger only minutes into the film...incredible, incredible performance, he deserves all the praise he is currently getting.The bad: The story. I get it, sometimes being a hero is not about being glorified, but taking the fall. That IS a superhero in a nutshell....and the development of that idea was good....but....it seemed like there was way too much work throughout the movie to arrive at something so.......... simple. I was awaiting a profound catharsis to make me think ""WOW"" and not a 'well, this is it after all of that'. Maggie Gyllenhaal was decent, though I have no idea what they were thinking in casting her. She did pull off the ""strong"" part of the character well, because she isn't attractive enough to be assumed as an airhead (sorry). It isn't just about that though... I found her dull, and almost apathetic. Maybe that was the point? Im not sure.Bale as batman is OK....I'll take it.... the over-the-top voice became ridiculous, and actually unintentionally comical though. I felt like I was listening to ""Brock from a 1-900 line"" at times.They went through SO much effort to explain the physics of the Batman costume, vehicles, details of how Sonar would work, that I started to become excited and interested...until the creation of two-face. I had a very difficult time accepting a man with such exposed burned/raw skin would be able to snarl and strut around without being.....well, the slightest bothered to the HUGE chance of infection/irritation. It was so ridiculous that I actually started to ponder details.... How is the exposed eyeball looking completely healthy when he has NO eyelid to moisten? How is he able to perfectly pronounce speech when he is missing half of his mouth/lips?? Go ahead...try to partially speak through only your teeth and see if it works that well. It was ridiculous. His transformation and ""meeting"" with the joker was disappointingly quick. The joker gives him a 4 minute pep talk and it was kind of ""well, that was easy"". There was little to no internal conflict, self-reasoning....he literally went from someone who SHOULD NOT be unable to function with muscle, bone, jaw, eyeball exposed to.... a child murdering thug? Huh? Then, after ALL the ups and downs in the film...batman rides off because he has to take the fall because ""sometimes heroes do that"". That was the conclusion? OK, that was ALSO easy....so.....is that it?? Really? REALLY?"
7416,True,"Spoilers: I am trying to figure out if I saw the same movie all these teenage boys are coming on here and claiming to be the best movie ever. Back in grade school when I was learning to write there was a concept called a run-on sentence. This was including too many ideas in one long un-punctuated line. This is essentially what the filmmakers gave us with Dark Knight. This film is in MAJOR need of an editor.First off all, there are way too many plots and subplots going on. Both the Joker and the Two Face story lines should have been treated as separate movies. Watching this movie I felt myself to be bored and was constantly looking at my watch. At over two and a half hours, this film was way too long. Compare this to a fast paced, entertaining well edited film like Plains, Trains, and Automobiles and you see how longer doesn't mean better. There were at least 3 incidents with the joker that I thought was the conclusion to the movie only to have it drag on for another long anti-climatic showdown.Secondly, I had never really thought of Michael Keaton as Batman, but after seeing Christian Bale's portrayal, Keaton is looking better and better every day. Unlike Keaton, or even Val Kilmer, Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is an extremely unlikeable character. A total jerk I felt little sympathy for unlike the affable Bruce Wayne Keaton gave us in the scene where Vicky Vale is looking at his collection of Samuri outfits. Batman Begins has a stupid beginning and an utterly idiotic ending, but at least the middle portion of that movie was entertaining. The Dark Knight was a complete bore.Another thing is that Ledger's Joker character came off more like the psycho loner from the original Dirty Harry film than the charismatic villain from the comics. And in this supposedly ""realistic"" interpretation of the Batman concept, the Jokers henchmen came across as the worst from the 60's TV show.All in all this movie was a disappointment, a real boring mess."
7417,True,"So it finally happened, a DC Comics movie adaptation that out-marveled the Marvel folks, and to such a degree that it might be quite a while before anything comes close to topping ""The Dark Knight"". This was the severely grim and gritty version of the Batman, ushered in by Frank Miller's initial treatment in the landmark graphic novel ""The Dark Knight Returns"" in 1986. Miller's portrayal of the iconic super hero took the gloves off as far as politically correct behavior goes. The movie explores this theme at many levels, and would have served up enough of a plot to keep this viewer interested even without the explosions, chases and general mayhem that modern day audiences need to get their fix on. Actually, the Joker summed it all up quite brilliantly hanging upside down from one of Batman's cables over the streets of Gotham, as noted in my summary line above. In the comic book world, they HAVE been fighting each other forever, or as long as forever exists since the creation of Batman back in 1939; the Joker came on the scene in 1940 in the comic, Batman #1.I don't think this could have been the same picture without Heath Ledger in the role of Batman's all time greatest nemesis. His portrayal blows away Jack Nicholson's performance in 1989's ""Batman"", and that's through no fault of Nicholson's. Today's films are a product of harsher and deadlier times, and it's striking that Ledger's characterization would define the Joker as an extremist, perhaps even a terrorist. More than once I found myself questioning what was going on during the opening bank robbery scene. The bad guys were offing each other based on instructions delivered by the Joker, and you suddenly come to the realization that this domino game had to end with one man standing. It's how we're introduced to Ledger's definitive Joker, a performance that won't be topped.Another thought came to me as I watched the story unfold, and that was how similar the coin toss gimmick paralleled the one in ""No Country For Old Men"". Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) began using the tactic following the death of Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and I began picturing Javier Bardem in the role of The Joker. Hard to imagine who might have been the more evil character, Bardem's Anton Chigurh in a more realistic setting, or The Joker in a fictional Gotham City. Fortunately, not a choice one would normally have to consider.I'm a little bit on the fence as to Christian Bale's portrayal of The Batman. He's more than adequate as Bruce Wayne, but the voice he gives to the Dark Knight seems a bit melodramatic. Granted, he couldn't use the same voice as his alter ego, but there were times that it sounded so forced as to come across as parody, and other times just goofy, almost a throwback to the Adam West days of the TV Batman. Strange, but have you considered that no one ever calls him the Caped Crusader anymore either?All in all, great performances all around. Gary Oldman's portrayal of the new Commissioner Gordon was excellent, while Michael Caine as Alfred, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox were solid even with limited screen time. I thought about Katie Holmes just once while making a mental comparison when Maggie Gyllenhaal first appeared on screen. Truthfully, they looked similar enough to effect the transition smoothly to the point where it wasn't distracting for me in the least.Obviously, the set up for the next sequel was firmly set in place with the creation of Two Face, the now alter ego of District Attorney Harvey Dent. The rendering of Dent's burned face was boldly executed and quite marvelous in it's own grotesque way. I'll be looking forward to the next installment.And NOW, for a personal rant. I probably should put this in parentheses because it doesn't have anything to do with the movie, but for this picture to be #1 on the IMDb list of all time best movies after 4 days of release is incomprehensible, if not downright laughable (and I did rate it a 10 myself). I think there should be a moratorium of at least a couple of years before a film qualifies for IMDb ranking, giving the dust some time to settle from all the grand opening hoopla that surrounds a picture like this. I feel the same way about other recent movies like ""No Country For Old Men"" and ""There Will Be Blood"", both of which garnered numerous awards and fan approval. But if they're to be considered among the best films of all time, they'll be considered that way a decade from now without the need for multiple votes from over zealous fan boys."
7418,True,"Like the great Shakespeare wrote: ""Those with empty heads shall nothing say, and so remain like stones 'til Earth's last day"". This is how I would describe Christopher Nolan's ""THE DARK KNIGHT"".I have duly noted its infamous popularity, which I can only attribute to a lack of understanding regarding, first of all, the art of aesthetics; and second, philosophy. This needs perhaps some elaboration.As Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a famous nihilist, notes, a man like the Joker can only exist given certain ontological realities, one being the de facto existence of pure probability rather than a fixed set of Platonic universals. This demonstrates an alleged entanglement with quantum physics: A simulacrum of the nothingness onto which the concept of meaning is applied can, it seems, take us further into the kind of world-view dominated by the struggle for understanding. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle seems apparent here, especially given that the philosophy of quantum mechanics now shows us that there are, in fact, cats that can live multiple lives at once under certain conditions monitored by the sort of pluviophilic entities hinted at before - there is in fact nothing certain at all, and we are left wondering if there is even such a thing as reality. The apparent flatus voicis we can derive from this pandemonium, this godless hell, is, I take it, the main concern and theme of ""THE DARK KNIGHT"", embodied in the positivistic antihero The Joker.Why does the film not deliver on these seemingly apparent premises? In the words of famous French philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, there simply cannot exist a set of ontological realities without a de facto set of morals; without morals, there cannot even be reality. Epistemology would dictate that we cannot be sure even of that very uncertainty Planck detected in his discovery of quantum leaps during the 1950s. The same phenomena apply to art as well, hence my entanglement of the two into an amalgam. But as ought to be apparent by now, these morals are left to wither in a helix of inconsistency. This is, in conclusion, what is thoroughly wrong with ""THE DARK KNIGHT"".This does not say, however, that the movie lacks any value of entertainment. You can watch it, if you choose to turn your brain off for its faulty epistemology.****/10"
7419,True,"After watching all three movies I must come to the conclusion that this is the weakest part of the three and that my initial thoughts of this movie were right this movie tries too hard!My first problem the main villain(who has more to do with The Crow than The Joker)besides a gag or two isn't funny(for all the over the top and campy acting of Nicholson his performance is much more true to the character and maybe even more menacing than Ledgers interpretation)and though it's a solid performance by Ledger(it's one of the good points in this movie)it isn't that impressive.The city has nothing to do with Gotham City whereas in part one you got the distinctive feel of a Gothic City in the second and third movie they seem to forget why Gotham City is called that way(it's more Techno-punk or Tech-noir than Gothic IMO) It takes itself way too serious and here lies the problem if you want us to take it seriously than there has to be something as logical plots and story-line.And you have to give us more than one dimensional characters if you want us to give a damn about them(and it's not that the talent is not there with a cast like this,but it's rarely used( example Gyllenhaal)IMHO Watchmen does a far better job and maybe because it has that seriousness in it's source-material whereas Batman has not(not in it's original form that is)which explains idiotic clues,like the scene with investigation of the bullet(It's The Joker NOT The Riddler),and inconsistencies in the characters e.g. The jokers says that he's like a mad dog chasing cars and acts psychotic while everything he does is very carefully planned far in advance that you have be rocket-scientist to plan like he does(if The Joker stands for chaos then it takes an awful lot meticulous planning and order to create chaos).And the transition from Harvey Dent into Two-face is plain silly. The score; somebody put Zimmer in a straight-jacket please has that man ever heard of the expression ""less is more"" important parts of the movie are totally spoiled by the far to present score.And then the giving of musical c(l)ues when something is going to happen,as if we are idiots(when you hear the beehive-like sound)becomes quite annoying.Maybe Two-face is actually the right comparison for this movie it's neither fish nor flesh it wants to be a great action-adventure comic - based movie on one side and a serious study into justice,power,chaos, terror and control on the other and that gives the whole movie a an artificial feel and it becomes frustrating when scenes for the sake of making a point interrupt the flow of the movie.all in all it tries to be two things at once and fails at both.2/10"
7420,True,"Just re-watched ""Dark Knight"" (2008), from the purchased Blu-Ray trilogy. I had rented this once years ago but had not seen it since then. My opinion about this movie has not changed. Sure, it was well done, but I still am mystified by the incredible adulation this movie gets.The single thing that I hated the most was the incredibly ridiculous, over-the-top effectiveness of the Joker. Come on. Even if he was connected like, say, someone in the Trust from 100 Bullets (a comic book reference), he couldn't have pulled off the grandiose schemes that he executes flawlessly again and again. Then, add on top of that, he's supposed be a psychopathic mad dog, and it becomes utter nonsense. ""World's greatest detective"" is transformed into guy desperately trying to stop someone who's so much better than he is that it's not even funny.Some of the basic themes of the movie were interesting and well done, like the idea of the Joker that everyone is just one bad day from being like him (the same basic theme in ""Killing Joke""). But really, if the Joker could pull the stunts he did in this movie, he could have had the entire country on its knees in days. Sheesh. Sorry, I just couldn't suspend my disbelief that far. Not only would one need to have incredibly meticulous planning, one would also need inconceivable resources, of the sort that a derelict like the Joker would never even come close to having.This bothered me so much that I just couldn't enjoy the movie.I agree, though, that Ledger's performance was quite amazing. He stole the show.I thought Batman Begins was very much the better movie. I haven't yet seen ""Dark Knight Rises"" so I'm hoping it's more in the vein of the first movie than the second."
7421,True,"It is difficult to write a bad review of a Batman movie. The franchise, started for most of us in childhood, grew to reach major movie studio treatment. That being said, the Dark Night Rises is a laughable attempt at completing the Batman story. At a very long 2 hour and 45 minutes, I eventually felt I was being held against my will. In fact, by the end, I was hoping that Metropolis would once and for all be destroyed. As luck would have it, that did not come to pass. The movie was filled with plot holes, a ridiculous villain and contrived drama. As the clock on the bomb counted down from the overused 5 seconds, a silent cheer could be heard in the audience watching with me as the end neared. The plot line, hard to call it that as it is more of a plot meander, like a slow moving stream that carves its way snaking along the unremarkable flatness of the mid-west, covers far too much territory far too glibly. The only character that was actually fun to watch was that of Anne Hathaway, and not for the most obvious of reasons. Her snide and cynical portrayal seems just right for this abomination of a film. I lack the ambition to finish this review as it makes me relive nearly three hours when I was held prisoner by The Batman!"
7422,True,"In one word - Unbelievable!!! But I will not stop at just one word. This film is as close to flawless as I have ever seen, and on top of that it sets a new standard, just as it's predecessor did, for the superhero film.Let's start with the technical aspects: Visual effects - The visual effects are simply mind - blowing!! The action moves seamlessly through the city. With even the most impossible things brought back to sheer realism. It shifts with ease between the normal and I - Max camera shots. The truck jacknife scene that includes the the batpod is especially thrilling.Directinng and Scriptwriting - Christopher Nolan directs with the hand of a cinematic master, effortlessly blending action, romance, humor and drama. The writing from Christopher and his brother John is fantastic!! Giving depth to all the characters and bringing in character growth that goes beyond the conventions of a superhero film.Now that this has been handled, let's go to the acting, all of the actors deliver stellar performances, bringing the struggles of the characters to full realisation, but the star of the show has to be Heath ledger in a wonderfully chilling and menacingly insane performance!!! Losing him was such a loss to the film industry.So for a thrilling and exhausting masterpiece do not look any further than the Dark Knight."
7423,True,"Heathe Ledger's ""Joker"" is a must watch! The film is based on finding out why he creates such havoc on Gotham City and the rest of the cast of characters allow the mystery to develop and reveal itself. Not a comic book fan, but Batman on film seems to be an apt cinema comic-book translation. The straight forward emotions are not conflicted with todays' complications leaving the actors to walk a fine line over stereotypes. The pace is fast and the plot a bit satiated, but it delivers everything it promises. Who cares what happens to Batman as when the Joker goes out of business, the movie has little intrigue. No worries, however, as Christopher Nolan sends us all off with thoughts of sequels!"
7424,True,"The Dark Knight tops Batman Begins enormously. The line-up feels so different but only a small part of the cast is new. If you thought the first was good, then this is the ultimate superhero film. The fact is, it doesn't even have the feel of a superhero flick. Yes, you have the hero going around in a costume complete with a mask and cape and, yes, you have the villain disguised by something and wearing an iconic costume but if you actually look closer, you'll see the hero is a vigilante and you'll see that his suit is very lethal and isn't a red and blue spandex outfit. And look closer at the villain and you'll see he is absolutely crazy and insane but is also very, very clever. The star of the film, however, isn't Bats. It's Heath Ledger as The Joker. His death a few months after the release of the film was tragic, so he left the world with one of the greatest characters of 21st century cinema. He is the glue of the film. The storyline is very good, without being too serious. A bit of humour is injected but at the right dose. See this film, and you will be amazed."
7425,True,"Im going to have to be brief because I hate this movie so much: 1. The Joker is too invincible. He is so invincible he can drive a bus out of a public place, rig a hospital and TWO boats and no one notices. Also everyone he comes in contact with even teenagers want to work for him even though he will kill them once needed. 2. Pointless characters. Lao should have been written out of the film, he adds nothing and amounts to nothing, pointless. The guy who knows who Batman is goes no where and his character only amounts to a stupid explosion 3. Breaks the main rule of cinema. The protagonist defeats the antagonists. There are two main villains in this movie and Batman doesn't defeat either one. 4. Harvey's motivation in the end. I hated Harvey through out the film but once he's two face he just becomes dumb, he believes that people should have a 50/50 chance like Rachel, though thats NOT WHAT HAPPENED. Gordan was just late so now he's going to and KILL GORDAN'S SON! There are other problems but those are the most major and I can not believe instead of noticing these problems people and went and gave it #8 on the top 250."
7426,True,"When 'The Dark Knight' was first released everyone was going to see it even if they hadn't seen the previous 'Batman Begins', simply because it was Heath Ledger's last completed role - and what a role it was. When you watch the film for the first ten minutes when you see Heath on screen you remember how he is sadly no longer with us and are reminded of the tragedy. However, when the Joker visits the mob and performs the 'pencil trick', Heath becomes the Joker. It's a rare occasion when you find a character so well performed that you forget it's an actor, but Heath did this astonishingly well. It's hard to find a weak link in the acting in this film. Christian Bale adds an almost comical edge to Bruce Wayne with his hints of mockery when it comes to talking to or about Harvey Dent. Bale also performs Batman well despite the odd voice which you get used to. Aaron Eckhart is another actor whose performance is excellent. His noble character of Harvey Dent is great but it's when he becomes Two-Face that you really see Eckhart's skill. It's a shame this side of his character is only shown for the final part of the film but he, like Heath Ledger, is able to totally immerse himself in the character.The familiar characters played by Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are welcomed again in this sequel and Maggie Gyllenhaal's replacement of Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes is also not controversial and Maggie acts very well.The script itself is full of twists and turns and leaves you gasping for the finishing half of the entire film. Christopher Nolan has done an excellent job with this film. Perhaps not his best ever script but it's definitely his best film so far, it will be difficult for him to create the sequel for this film as he has simply made an excellent film here which is difficult to beat."
7427,True,"Christopher Nolan steps back into the director's chair for this sequel to Batman Begins, which finds the titular superhero coming face to face with his greatest nemesis -- Joker in this movie entitled,The Dark Knight. Christian Bale returns to the role of Batman, Maggie Gyllenhaal takes over the role of Rachel Dawes, and Brokeback Mountain star Heath Ledger dons the ghoulishly gleeful Joker makeup previously worn by Jack Nicholson and Cesar Romero. Just as it begins to appear as if Batman, Lt. James Gordon,played by Gary Oldman, and District Attorney Harvey Dent,portrayed by Aaron Eckhart, are making headway in their tireless battle against the criminal element, a maniacal, wisecracking fiend plunges the streets of Gotham City into complete chaos.Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut in 1940, and the 1996 series The Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face's origin. In addition elements of Steve Englehart and Marshall Rogers' Dark Detective miniseries as well as the unpublished follow-up were reportedly cannibalized along with other elements of Batman mythology for the story.In Gotham City, the Joker and accomplices rob a mob-owned bank, the Joker killing off the others and escaping alone. Batman and Lieutenant Jim Gordon decide to include the district attorney Harvey Dent in on their plan to bring down Gotham's mob, currently led by Sal Maroni. Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne meets Dent and Rachel Dawes, deciding to host a fund raiser to show his support for Dent. The Joker approaches the mob, offering them his services should they need it. Corrupt accountant Lau, working for the mob, flees to Hong Kong but is dragged back to Gotham by Batman, agreeing to testify against the mob.Maroni and the Chechen turn to the Joker who begins murdering people on a daily basis unless Batman unmasks himself. Among the casualties are Commissioner Loeb. The Joker targets Dent at the fund raiser, Bruce hiding him. The Joker tries to assassinate Mayor Garcia during Loeb's memorial service, Gordon taking the bullet and seemingly dying. Rachel is targeted, Bruce and Alfred Pennyworth looking after her. At a press conference, Dent claims he is Batman instead of Bruce who planned to confess to the public, and is escorted by police to county prison. The Joker intercepts, but is caught by Gordon, who faked his death. Gordon is promoted to Commissioner as a reward. However, Rachel and Dent both disappear, Batman confronting the Joker and learning both are in building filled with explosives. Batman and Gordon go to save them, Batman finding Dent and saving him, but Rachel is killed when the explosives detonate. Dent's face is set on fire and half of it is left severely scarred. The Joker escapes from the Gotham police department with Lau.Coleman Reese, an accountant working at Wayne Enterprises under Lucius Fox, realizes Bruce is Batman and plans to publicly expose him. The Joker, who kills Lau and the Chechen, threatens to bomb a hospital unless Reese is killed. Gordon rescues Reese, while the Joker visits the crazed Dent in hospital, convincing him to get revenge on those who ""truly"" killed Rachel. Dent kills Officer Wuertz, and spares Maroni and Officer Anna Ramirez, using his lucky coin to decide their fate. The Joker threatens to takeover the city, putting two ferries of citizens and Arkham Asylum inmates against one another, giving them to decision to blow each other up. Batman confronts the Joker, aided by Lucius using a machine able to detect phones across the city and use them as a locator. The ferry passengers refuse to kill each other, and Batman captures the Joker, but not before he learns of Dent's rampage. Dent lures Gordon to the building where Rachel died, holding his family hostage and threatens to shoot his son. Batman arrives, tackling Dent off the building to his death.Deciding to take the blame for Dent's victims, Batman forces Gordon to make him a fugitive and portray Dent as Gotham's true hero. In the closing scenes, Gordon destroys the Bat Signal, and Lucius watches the locator machine self-destruct, and Batman flees the police, Gordon considering Batman the city's real hero.Dark, complex and unforgettable, The Dark Knight succeeds not just as an entertaining comic book film, but as a richly thrilling crime saga.It becomes more than just a superhero film unlike the others released like Superman,Spiderman,Green Latern and many others as it was more than a comic-book adventure but a sprawling crime epic.Allusions to our current struggles with surveillance, public perception and terrorism are thrown into the mix, adding political immediacy to Nolan's psycho noir.The acting of the cast was simply superb and outstanding particularly the late Heath Ledger,whose last role the Joker would still go down in cinema history as one of the most creepily unhinged big-screen bad guys of all time.Finally,this also proves that Christopher Nolan is much, much smarter than your average filmmaker.It was simply one of the best films ever made and the best superhero film ever made."
7428,True,"I loved the first film, but i just could escape the feeling that this was a lot more of a popcorn movie. The only bright spot in the movie for me was the joker brilliant insane agent of chaos.Played to the hilt by heath ledger. The were too many things that made no sense in the film and could only be explained by corporate interference,The man responsible for the first great film simply couldn't have made this mess(or so i thought)The heavily armoured ""tank like"" batmobile built for the army is taken out by a rocket?Thus batsy must eject in the bat pod and a new ""must buy"" toy vehicle for the kids. The military must have asked for a bridging vehicle that can eject a motor bike from wayne industries?? (an example of the military-industrial complex gone mad or completely non-sensical idea that the writer didn't think through?)Batman goes to hong kong for about 5 minutes to catch a man we barely see again.The bullet ""resistant"" armour is penetrated by a DOG?With kevlar Dentures perhaps?So now batsy has to have a completely different suit made and thus a completely new action figure for the kids.Ker chingThe gotham city of the first film looks completely different,even the brass looking monorail of batman begins(a major feature and plot point of the film) .It is replaced by the very dark industrial looking chicago elevated train system.And did they really think we wouldn't notice that the sandstone pointed-roof tower of wayne tower was suddenly morphed into Black flattop of completely different design.Several signs bellow ""welcome to chicago"" in the background.The new Rachel dawes is completely different and the new actress doesn't even try to emulate the character seen in the first film.An utterly pointless cameo from the scarecrow ,captured in 30 seconds flat .over all a wasted opportunity kind of like comparing x men to the dire sequels avoid"
7429,True,"Wow...Firstly this might be the most overrated movie of all-time. The hype was insane. and putting that aside even. People who saw this movie acted and are currently even to this day calling it one of the greatest films of all-time.After watching this movie, I had mixed feelings. Like most people however I enjoyed it. But here are the problems.. OVER ACTING!! My god! I have never seen such bad mellow dramatic acting in my life. I mean it's a batman movie. You can only take it so far. and this film kills it in-terms of milking every seen. It was like they wanted it to be 2 hours and 30 minutes long, and in order to do that, they just extended the dialogue between characters basically to a point, where i didn't even care what was happening.Bale is a terrible Batman. Give me Keaton any day. That voice? Come on why does he have to growl to speak.and now the Joker. It's a tragedy what happened to Ledger. But people are so blinded by his death, that basically you can't except that his portrayal of the Joker............ is good............. Solid..... but nothing more!!.......... It's not the best portrayal of a villain ever, so quit acting like it is!! He's very tame in my opinion. Not scary, not twisted, not really that evil. For a guy who looks like that, they could have had the character be a bit more violent.People say the scene where he slits the guy's mouth. that it's so terrifying. but You don't even see anything, no blood, nothing. The camera even turns away, all you see is the guy fall. WOW. Like really if you watch the film nothing that crazy happens.Conclusion: Take your blinders off and stop falling for what the media deems as good.People who liked this movie are clones. and the fact that it's in the top 10 on IMDb is appalling."
7430,True,"Seeing as this movie was in the IMDb top 10 of all times i decided i should have a look. So yesterday i decided to watch it and my expectations were very high. First off; Yes it is an enjoyable movie, but does it deserve to be in the top 10 of greatest movies all time? My opinion is no, not at all...Heath Ledgers plays his role really good. He is the scariest and best joker i've seen in the Batman films so far. The way he portraits the joker sometimes makes you wonder if he's acting or just really insane, brilliant performance! I found the Batman character a bit overdone by Christian Bale (his voice is a bit overreacted in my opinion). So does this have the best acting in movies of all time? No.. its just Heath who does a good job here for me...The story evolves around Gotham being terrorized by the mafia and the joker. Harvey Dent (who later becomes 2 face) wants to clean up the city. He succeeds in this at first, however he did not get to the real mastermind, the joker. The Joker is a criminally insane mastermind. The movie has some action scenes that evolve about people being kidnapped and batman saving them. I know its an adaptation to the comic book version, but i found the story to be really weak and predictable. And the good guy gone bad (harvey dent) is one big cliché. I've all seen it before! Even the kidnapping.. i mean come on... this is one of the best story's told of all time? No.. so what makes the movie get this high rating then?When i finished watching the movie i was absolutely shocked... How did this movie get an 8.9 on IMDb? How did it end up in the top 10 of best movies all time? Really.. I think this is a good movie, but one of the best... no way! It does not have the deep involving storyline of the Godfather nor the unique plot twists Pulp Fiction has. It also does not have the epic feeling any of the Lord of The Rings movies have. Actually i can find nothing where the movies really stands out compared to other typical action movies. And if you want to compare it to comic book movies... Sin City does a way better job at creating a unique atmosphere and also has a more unique story.I find this to be an enjoyable movie, but also one of the most overrated movies of all time. I seriously can not see why this should be on par with: The Godfather, Pulp Fiction, Lord of the Ring or Sin City."
7431,True,"To be honest...I fell as though I'm he only real critic reviewing this movie. People are making it sound like its the holy grail of all superhero movies. If your critical about movies and are looking for some technical and literary masterpiece than i hate to say it, but this isn't the right movie.This movie has completely outrageous action scenes, great affects, and a standard plot, which holds it back, and il explain why.The Dark Night does very little to make this movie different from your average ""blow-em-up"" superhero movie. The Joker is portrayed as a psychotic criminal who ""appears"" to be extremely unstable. The joker is an excellent character in this movie because they show a side of the joker that was never shown in the previous movie with Jack Nicholson. It's almost like the joker was separated from his jokester side and he finally embraced that psychotic unpredictable villain we always knew was there.This movie is different for 2 reasons which makes it stand out just a bit.First, Heath Ledger is remarkable in his roll as the joker, and this movie really makes the joker a psychotic genius that will always make you think twice.Second, The Dark Knight really has one main theme, and thats ""what really makes a hero?"" The dark knight touches up on that question pretty well, and it leaves room for you to state your own opinion.now, other than that... the acting was ""good"" the action was crazy, but nothing a 6 year old wouldn't think of, and two face wasn't thought out at all.And can someone tell me how 2 face survived that car accident? i mean please, that was just stupid.bottom line is, this is your average action movie. You cant help feeling that the joker is the only thing that captures you the whole movie. I was hoping this movie would do for action movies what 28 days later did for zombie movies, but sadly it doesn't. The dark knight doesn't make it as ""masterpiece"" or a ""work of art"" its simply a superhero movie with some interesting characters and a theme that gets you thinking, nothing more."
7432,True,"I really hate those censorious critics. When everyone is saying The Dark Knight is truly one of the top five movies in the whole history and the movie itself is becoming really popular, someone laughs coldly and says things like ""this is the most overrated movie ever made"". And if you go deeper to their ideas, you find all they have done is pick up the small detailed flaws of the movie, which is completely not affecting the whole quality and worthiness of seeing more than twice of the movie. Hey boy, WHY SO SERIOUS? I wonder if those people work in a watch factory, in which you are never allowed to make a single tiny mistake because if you do, you will ruin the whole work. Movie is art, and art is never perfect. Its imperfection is the very thing that makes it amazing.The Dark Knight is not perfect, or in other word, can anyone name a literally perfect movie? Is Godfather perfect, or The Shawshank Redemption? But they are indeed amazing aren't they? I really think The Dark Knight should be even longer, maybe three hours will do. This is a so complex multi-layer script, for many directors it's too hard to tell the story and make it clear to the audience. The Nolans made it, although not 100 percent, but they did make it understood plus shining plus intriguing! If the movie were long enough, the story-telling would be even more clear and very importantly, not that tied up, which is the biggest shortage of The Dark Knight.Then it's time to talk about why it is so amazing. I hate to say everything in the movie is great because that's over-simplifying and showing no respect for the standing out. THE JOKER, it's him who makes the movie different. It's not only about Heath's acting,(actually I have no idea how to describe how great his acting is, it simply defies description) it's about the role. Many marvel that this joker is the NO1 villain of the history, indeed he is, why? Because he never deserves anyone's mercy, in other words, he is, in absolute terms, bad, bad enough to go way beyond the punishment people make to measure the fierceness of bad. He is a villain that will stay longer in your heart and control your thoughts than your best hero image can do. A hero is an example; a villain like the joker is an obsession.So I suggest you not fall too deep in love with The Dark Knight and the joker, although I already have."
7433,True,"This is what happens when a good movie appears in the mainstream. People who are used to Hollywood junk stand in awe now and praise this movie as a masterpiece. Well, it is a good movie, but it has nothing to do in the TOP 10! I don't care much about that non-realistic stuff, it's a comics already, however there some flaws which keeps my rating in the middle. Joker steals the show. No doubt about that. I found myself bored between the scenes without this villain. And the second thing which lowered the score was that pathetic would-be moralistic message. People wouldn't kill others to save themselves? Am I supposed to believe in a all-of-a-sudden-kind prisoner who will make the decision (on a boat full of prisoners!) not to blow the other ship (full of of oh-so-innocent people) in the air? And vice versa? I said I didn't mind the unrealistic bits, but this was just laughable. But all in all, it was quite entertaining even though the story was somehow flat."
7434,True,"Batman Begins had been a great surprise because I did not expect too much from it and it resulted to be excellent and with a perfect characterization of Batman.So,I had high hopes with The Dark Knight.I did not like this film as much as Batman Begins and it's not the masterpiece everybody say it is but,still,it's a very good movie which is very entertaining and exciting.Let's see the positive elements from this film.The character of The Joker is perfect.It's brilliantly developed and his dramatic arc and motivation are truly perfect.And,talking about The Joker,I have to admit that Heath Ledger (1979-2008) brought a phenomenal performance.Ledger made the character really memorable and there were a lot of moments in which his performance left me astonished (the scene at the hospital proves Ledger was a genius as an actor).It's very sad that he died because he was extremely young and it would have been very interesting seeing Ledger getting the recognition he would totally deserve.The action sequences are very exciting and the direction is pretty good.But,in the last 45 minutes,the movie goes dawn and it looses some points.After Rachel's death,I thought the movie was going to end but it was not like that.The film introduces a second villain and I did not think that was a correct decision because that character is not too well developed and,at the difference of The Joker,you can never know him too well.So,I felt forced that part of the movie.It would have been better if director Christopher Nolan had left that villain for the third part so that he could have been better developed.But,in spite of that,I can recommend The Dark Knight.I do not think it's the masterpiece a lot of people say it is and I liked Batman Begins more but the film is never boring and it brought me a very exciting and satisfactory time."
7435,True,"Listen, this movie is great, but in the future if you were to ask me what my top 5 films of all time are, we will all forget about this until someone mentions it. This is a great movie hands down, and i think what played the biggest part in this film was the music. If it wasn't for that ""THX"" sound byte continuously playing throughout the film this film wouldn't have been as intense as it was. If you played the same sound byte in No Country for Old Men, you would've been more terrified by Chigurh than the Joker's character.I personally believe, sad to say, but the death of Heath Ledger has led to many to automatically rank this as a ten. Yes, it's a great and stellar performance from the late Heath Ledger, but I think just knowing that he's dead and you watching him on the screen has led you to gather more fear for this villain cause of the nerves instilled within you of a man who just died couple of months ago. He deserves an Oscar for his performance, hands down, but I still believe Javier Bardem's character was more frightening than the Joker.In conclusion, what I think is grabbing the audience and throwing them over the hill for this movie is the fact that it's a comic, and usually comics are just a fun ride. This, on the other hand was dark and caught them all off guard. With that, it has explored the pop culture from their common joy ride of comics and has given them a ride that they can't handle. It's the same as entering City of God, Children of Men, No Country without knowing what the movie is about.Props to Nolan for making a great film. I'm a bit bitter due to the fact that this film is number 1 of all time, and it really looks like there's no turning back. It's a top 30 in my eyes, but I actually like no country more, so let's say a top 40. (and i just checked, when the hell did NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN DROP TO 70??!?!? That's close to being as ridiculous as Do the Right Thing not being on the list.)You can hate me all you want."
7436,True,"It's an exciting movie, I didn't get bored in this 2.5 hours!! Great!!! There are several reasons attracting me to watch this movie. I think the first one is that movie was actually filmed in HK. When I first heard this news, I felt quite excited about it and so wished I could see the real batman on the top of IFC or central plaza.. Of course, I didn't come to see him. It's actually amazing that seeing Hong Kong in that famous Hollywood movie!!! Hong Kong is very beautiful of course!!!! It's sweet to hear some Cantonese as well!!! The second reason was Heath Ledger. I was very interested in seeing how this character made him that stressful!! Did he die for taking too much drugs which could relieve his stress?? Or he was just a drugs abuser?? I don't know, but I am sure it's very pity for a young actor like him died so early!! He acted actually quite good in the movie, his facial and body expressions were too great as well as the way he speaking!! The third reason was Edison Chan. How did his sex scandal affect his character?? He was appeared in the movie within 5 seconds and spoke 1 sentence. I had no idea what he supposed to act in this film, but I couldn't see his character is necessary in that movie. In fact, another unknown Chinese guy Mr Lau was an important character. I like that scene most, when the Joker planted explosives on two ferries of evacuees and gave the passengers on board the chance to destroy the opposing vessel, one full of prison convicts and another with civilians, in order to save their own lives. When the civilians first heard that, some of them had already suggested the cops to push the button and let all prisoner die. To be fair, the cop decided to distribute everyone a piece of paper and let all people to have a vote for saving themselves or killing others. Surprisingly, there were still quite a lot of people voting to not kill the prisoners. I think it's a very hard decision!! A man stood up and said the criminals were deserved to die and they were sinless. Nobody wanted to take the action to kill the people in other boat, that man thought he could do so, he stood up and pick up the controller and eventually put it down and returned to his seat. On the other hand, the boat with prison convicts were silent, they were humbled as they realized they had committed different types of crime. At the very last minute, a big man stood out and told the cop that ""I know you don't want to die, you can tell everyone I attack you and steal your controller"" and he got the controller and threw it into sea. What a brave man!! I think this guy is much better than those civilians. At last, both vessels' occupants decide they would rather not sacrifice the lives of the passengers in the other vessel for their own. Eventually, nobody killed as the joker didn't put the timer on, it's just a trick that he wanted to test how selfish people were in the very hard moment!!! It's great that people won!!! On the other hand, even a very good men can fall like Harvey Dent, the so called ""white knight of the city"" corrupted as her girlfriend was killed. Good story that let me to think more about the meaning of scarify, never think how important you are. Don't be that over-confident and arrogant!! Always be humble like the sinner instead of hero!!"
7437,True,"The Dark Knight is very good. It met my expectation amid the hype.It's a better film than Batman Begins, which I disliked for its weak story, hack editing and subpar acting (Katie Holmes's acting was amateurishly horrible) as noted in my previous review. It carries a darker tone compared to the preceding Batman movies, including Batman Returns.The strength of the film lies on the story and Health Ledger's performance. Heath was splendid in this movie without going ""hysterically"" over the top. Chris's direction is fine, until the last half hour that became confusing and overdone with clichés and intermittent boredom.Towards the ending, the monologues are ridiculously ""long"" starting with the villains explaining their motives before their inevitable demise. This is identical to the final boss villains' overlong explanation why they do the things out of egotism and madness in old-school RPG video games like Final Fantasy. It ends with another monologue that summarize the title as the weight of the theme. Add some strange editing choice by returning hack editor Lee Smith that left me a little confounded. As usual, action scenes are rendered confusing in the midst of the violence.I found Two-Face's ""Fangoria gore"" appearance a tad grotesque for a PG-13 rating, which is pushing it hard as the violence in Dark Knight is more intense, frequent and cruel. That's not to say I didn't enjoy the movie for the sake of violence but the level of violence (and gory with Two-Face's mangled half-moon face) is quite surprising that clearly isn't suitable for PG-13. I prefer the traditional appearance of Two-Face as originated in Neal Adams-drawn Detective Comics in the early 70's. The Two-Face as seen in Dark Knight is a glorified horror movie monster.The Dark Knight is an alright movie, but severely overrated. It achieved number one on IMDb top 250, making it better than The Godfather, Wages of Fear, Citizen Kane and many obviously better-told and -directed movies despite the age. Young fanboys cannot be bothered to see these movies since their film appreciation education is limited to movies made in the last twenty years.The Dark Knight is a vast improvement over the lame, poorly edited Batman Begins, owing to Heath's tour de force performance in spite of the story that suffers the similar flaws as Spider-Man 3 -- one villain too many and lecture-like speeches emotionally baiting the audience's jeers & sympathy for cheap thrills to conclude at the end.*** out of 4Post script: I saw the film for the second time on the afternoon of July 31. As noted criticizing the flaws for dragging the film towards the ending, I walked out of the screening just after two hours hit the mark (after the hospital blows up). I do not have to endure such tedium that extinguish the excitement as soon as Two-Face enter the picture. The Nolan brothers and story writer David Goyer intentionally padded the length of the movie to make it as ""epic as Michael Mann's Heat"", and this is what hurts the movie the most. I love long movies but this is not one of them -- it's plain exhausting and exasperating. Less is more, okay, David, Chris and Jonathan? Heath Ledger's fearless performance is worth watching however."
7438,True,"Is this the #1 movie of all time? No, it's not. Putting this movie above the Godfather, Shawshank and some of the others that sit at the top of our 250 is really a sign of everyone buying into the hype. For a group that sees itself as such movie buffs and true fans of cinema, placing the Dark Knight above some of the aforementioned movies does a disservice to the Dark Knight itself. I'm not debating the fact that this was an enjoyable movie. It certainly was. I just think placing it at number one is a huge reach.That said, there were fantastic performances. I love the performance by Ledger. Posthumous Supporting Actor Oscar or not, Heath will be immortalized in this role. Eckhart was good in his role; much preferred his Harvey Dent to that of Tommy Lee Jones. He brought more of the ""White Knight"" aspect to the role that helped me understand his role in the movie other than just an angry guy flipping a coin. Bale, as always, was good. However I don't quite,understand the deep, scratchy ""Batman Voice"". He even uses it in costume while speaking with Alfred. It's hard to hear sometimes and sometimes led my thoughts astray.Caine and Oldman are pros that could read the ingredients of a recipe and make it sound interesting. Gyllenhaal is fine but not a ton to work with.Good action sequences and lots of disturbingly funny moments with Ledger's Joker.Again, I really enjoyed this movie, I just have to question it's placement at #1 in our top 250. Watch the Godfathers 1 & 2, Shawshank, the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, Pulp Fiction, and Schindler's List and then compare it to this film. If you do that and still think The Dark Knight tops it, that's fair, it's earned the top spot for me. But for me, I have to place a few films ahead of it. In fact, I have given some movies 10's that most people wouldn't. I just feel with this one, everyone got a little excited and hit the 10/10 button too fast.9/10."
7439,True,"This movie is a mixed bag, which many people seem scared to admit, as if doing so would diminish the fantastic performance by the late Heath Ledger. While Ledger's performance is great (discussed later), the movie as a whole does not stand up to the caliber of his performance. Given how great a job Ledger did, this is not all that much of a criticism, but there are a few things that bog this movie down. Firstly, and perhaps the pettiest criticism, the voice with which Christian Bale chooses to speak as Batman is a bit forced and hokey, which might not matter so much if every line out of his mouth didn't sound like a prophetic certainty. And the voice is quite a deliberate choice--- when Bale is portrayed as Bruce Wayne, his manner of speaking is more relaxed, but also more human. It feels, after a few scenes, as if Batman is almost parodying himself. The acting is somewhat stiff and rigid, and while this makes Batman seems a bit dull at times, it reinforces a degree of aloofness and coldness that is fitting for the character. Maggie Glyenhall (I'm probably spelling that wrong...), who plays Rachel, is a fine actress, and does a good job, but her character is in the film almost entirely as a mere plot device, and she's not given much to work with. Admittedly, focusing on her character would have been more time in an already long film, but nonetheless, it felt as if the writers realized they needed some sort of female counterpart to all the male cast. She does well with what she's given, but in the end is pretty much just a damsel in distress. The only other real criticism I have is that despite what the majority of reviews have tended to suggest, the dialogue is kind of weak in many places. Fair enough, the Joker gets the majority of choice lines, to which the characters around him simply seem stiff and too dense to say anything impressive. But the dialogue lacks any subtlety. We are told directly that 'So-and-so represents x, and so-and-so represents y, therefore, z', again and again. It's a nice little pseudo-intellectual insight which gets beaten to death. I wouldn't be so harsh on this subject, were there any other substance to ponder in the movie, other than 'Can a hero who does unheroic things still be a hero?'. Harvey Dent is what 'The Dark Night' is really about, in many ways, and his transformation into 'Two-Face' . There have been quite a lot of complaints that the Harvey Dent storyline detracts from the Batman/Joker dynamic, and I understand this sort of gut reaction to preparing to sit through another superhero movie where somehow, more than one villain is supposed to make the film better. But the questionability of whether Dent is actually a 'villain' is what makes this story work (and is quite resolved by the end). I don't see how anyone who has actually seen this movie could call the Harvey Dent storyline 'filler'. It's the lynch-pin of the whole film. And so. As for the Joker, and Heath Ledger's portrayal. It's pretty good. Not Oscar caliber, not the best acting ever committed to screen, and so radically different from Jack Nicholson's Joker that the comparisons are somewhat moot. As fantastic as Ledger's portrayal of the Joker was, the role is a difficult one to assess, for several reasons. The Joker is the most interesting villain Batman had to contend with. Before mention of TDK's production was out, there was buzz from the end of 'Batman Begins' that the Joker (at that time uncast) would be in the sequel. This is the same sort buzz that resulted from the news that Venom was going to be a part of Spiderman 3. The character of the Joker is emblazoned in the mind of any comic book reader as the finest portrayal of insanity and evil. The Joker is simply a fascinating character. Thus, with any decent actor, the plastic insanity of the Joker can be well molded (and Ledger was certainly more than a 'decent actor'). In addition, there is the matter of Ledger's death. How can anyone with any heart say 'that was a lousy last role?'--- luckily there is no reason to. But a certain sentimentality and desire to honor Ledger's last role seems to push people in the other direction, to glorify it as the best acting ever accomplished. It is a fantastic job; but a fantastic job for an action movie, wherein the bar is, admittedly, set a bit lower. The Joker makes this movie exciting and complex. Ledger did better than many would have expected. But let's not get carried away out of some desire to honor a person by praising their last role uncritically. The role is good enough that it, and the film, can bear a little criticism, can stand up to it and still be a really well-done action movie. In five, ten, or even fifteen years, how will less news-sensitive viewers see this movie? I think it will still be regarded as extremely good, and worth watching. But certainly not one of the ten best movies ever made. Enjoy it for what it is, and you will certainly enjoy it."
7440,True,"Although this is a competent film, I can not but begin my comment with a word of caution because of the stunning result of the vote until now which gives the movie a 9.7, a mark that has not been approached by another film in IMDb I am aware of. I have to say that the Greek quality press was very much impressed by the movie which made me want to watch it. It also characterized the movie as ""realistic"". I have to admit I can not agree with the last comment in the sense that the technological appliances used by both heroes and villains are not part of everyday life and use, at least in the part of the world I come from. Also besides the fact, that the character played by the late Ledger, was the most memorable in the movie, I can not but observe, that contrary to the comments made by newspaper film critics speaking about the deep and strange thoughts the joker has, I simply found him a case of psychotic illness out of a medical textbook, adding the impressing but ultimately annoying mannerisms of the actor. Surely the movie spoke about the dilemmas inherent in law-keeping and administration of justice, as well as about the meaning of heroism, but those things have been tackled again and again in all artistic media and everyday life, in a subtler manner. Joker seems to enjoy evil for evil's sake as opposed to the profit-oriented mafia bosses, he is at loggerheads with, although I find their motivation much more normal judging from experience.Despite the profoundness that certain critics found in Joker, I simply find him weird and strange and surely not in a par with other eminent villains as Macbeth for example. The effects were impressive and the performance of the actor that played Batman especially when speaking with a distorted voice under the mask as if a heroic version of Darth Vader. Michael Caine was interesting as Wayne's butler and confidante but his character was a flat one and limited in scope. I found Garry Oldman's portrayal as Lt General of the police, Gordon convincing in the sense that he played a normal middle-aged character in a position of responsibility with normal human affections, for wife and children for example. Ledger's performance must have been very demanding physically and I credit him for that but the character is so, forgive me the word, bananas that I can not judge him, except the fact that he was portraying a cartoonish hero and not a human one. The idealistic district attorney was idealistic clearly and then he turned evil, justifying Joker's world view. His physical appearance was that of a committed educated American from an Ivy League university, someone like Kennedy for example- a figure from American political mythology. The movie had interesting scenes of destruction which added to it's already tense atmosphere, enhanced by advanced visual and acoustic technology. The plot was twisted as the the villainous characters were and sometimes an inexperienced viewer would have been at odds to discover was was really going on. Overall this has been a good movie, withstanding the fact that the arch villain was impossible to comprehend and that moral dillemmas were portrayed in a rather platitudinous and obvious manner despite the attitude of subtlety and complexity that the movie sought desperately to convey."
7441,True,"Slightly better than Spiderman 2 and Iron Man.Good points: 1. The Joker - not scary but captivating.2. Some very funny dialog - YOU COMPLETE ME 3. A few surprises, not plot twist surprises but rather people show up where you don't expect them4. The acting is very solid all around. I like that Oldman had a bigger part this time.Bad Points:1. I may have figured Nolan's lame fight sequences out. In B.Begins when Bruce Wayne is fighting on the ice while training with the League of Shadows that scene is excellent, you see free moving martial arts. Obviously, the Bat suit limits the actors' & stunt doubles' movement. To hide this Nolan shoots the fights REALLY close up and jumps around with the editing. It's very annoying. He should find a work around or watch a Jason Statham movie. 2. Three climaxes. I wish it ended with the Joker turning Two-Face to the dark side and with Two-Face's new look being revealed. 3. The monitor graphics representing citywide cell phone Sonar was cheap looking. It looked too much like Professor X monitoring all the X-men in the world.4. I keep waiting for the guy from LOST to finally age --no answers here.Outside of the poorly filmed fight scenes, minor complaints.Pet Peeve: Luscious Fox was introduced into the Batman story-line in 1979. They just stole Q from James Bond and made him black. WTF?Oscar note: I definitely won't complain if Ledger wins the Oscar. He was excellent.I don't see Johnny Rotten in this character, I see Donald Duck meets Edward Scissorhands (in a good way and, yes, it's possible). I do think Jared Leto gave a better, more subtle and a more bone chilling performance portraying Mark David Chapman in the excellent and disturbing CHAPTER 27. I'm thinking it's harder to play a REAL psychopath and be bound by reality with no face paint, props or crazy laugh than to be a comic book villain. Leto probably won't get it because very few people saw CHAPTER 27 and too many small minded reviewers had a knee-jerk reaction to the subject matter of that film. I think Ledger would be in a different category anyway, I guess best supporting actor.Listen, if someone gave you Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Christian Bale and a 100+ million dollars could you make an 8 star film? I'd go with probably. Nonetheless, the good reviews are mostly true. Fun comic book movie with a great villain.p.s. Can the reviewers here PLEASE stop criticizing Maggie Gyllenhaal's looks? She looks fine and is solid here. Not everyone can look like Angelina Jolie."
7442,True,"there may be spoilers. after reading all the comments on the internet about how great the dark knight was, i decided to give my own personal opinion about the movie. i have grown sick of all these people surrounding me boasting about how incredible the film is, and how it was a great pleasure just to see it. after hearing all this, i decided to see the dark knight and see if it lived up to all the credit it was getting.the plot, when stripped down to the bare essentials, is just what is expected. there is a menace running around town causing trouble and its up to a guy dressed in a bat costume to stop him. thats all i really want to say about the movie, as when watching the movie, thats all i really cared about. the movie tried to fit in a bunch of sub-plots, such as batman trying to keep himself from going corrupt, Harvey dents transformation into 2-face, but in my opinion, these plots just made the film lag and made the movie more boring than it already was. i mean, when watching, who really cares what the police think of all the crime in the city(which was also one of the films many sub-plots)? when i began watching, i wanted to see one thing- joker destroying town and batmans attempts to stop him. thats what the trailer showed, thats what all the posters showed, thats what i wanted to see.but before i start ranting, lets focus on what was good about the movie-good acting- all of the characters (excluding batman and Harvey dent) did a very believable job. great set design-the movie tries to be dark, and it succeeds.but thats about it. mostly i found just complaints about the film. first off, lets complain about batman. Christian bale did a good job doing Bruce wayne, but he fell flat on his face doing batman. the voice he uses when playing batman (the scruffy voice, that sounds like he smokes 50 packs of cigarettes a day) was cool in batman begins, but in the dark knight it was just tiresome. i cringed every time batman spoke. next off, i was annoyed that batman sort went back-stage.joker became the main center-piece, while batman was reduced to sitting in a corner pretending to be the hero.2nd off, the joker. now i know I'm going to get a lot of bashing for this, but heath ledger didn't really create a convincing joker. in my opinion, the joker was not that great of a villain. i mean, he did a great acting job, but his interpretation of the killing socio-path was not all that believable. i could not understand why everybody in the movie was so scared of him. i never felt frightened when he was on-screen. i never felt threatened. heath ledger should have done another villain. i know I'm talking about a different movie now, but take the 1989 version of batman. jack Nicholson did a much better version of the joker. his version is the way joker should be. when he was on the screen, he was so dementedly disturbing, so....vile that you couldn't help crapping your pants when he entered a room. jack did a version of joker that can still haunt people today. i know that heaths version would probably kill more people, but jacks is 10x more scary.especially with his cruel smile (shudders). thirdly, the movie is utterly boring. i watched the movie 3 times, and i fell asleep 2 of the times. i have noticed here on IMDb that the dark knight is rated the greatest action movie of all time. when i read that, i felt like screaming WHAT THE HECK!!!!!!!!. the dark knight is sort of an action film, i suppose, but the action is really nothing special. i counted the action sequences in the movie, and there were 5. the first 3 can hardly be even called action. its all just batman jumping out of nowhere, laying a couple punches and jumping into the shadows again(which he seems to do often in the film). the 4th sequence is just the joker trying to kill Harvey dent, and batman chasing him on a bike and managing to flip over the jokers truck. its cool, but not worthy to be called action. only the last action sequence can be called action, and by that time, the movie has run so long that you just want it to end. i heard that the director filmed the action scenes using a special kind of camera, to make them more exciting. i really couldn't tell that the action was special in anyway. in short, the movie is OK, but that is seriously all. its just......OK. if you are bored an afternoon, go rent it, but don't expect the greatest movie all time, as everybody is saying nowadays. those who say that should actually watch some of the greatest movies of all time, such as the godfather,raiders of the lost ark,pulp fiction, the shawshank redemption,etc, and then say with a straight face the dark knight is amazing. p.s- by the way, jokers magic pencil trick was not anything special either."
7443,True,"This movie completely blew me away. Heath Ledger plays a psychotic joker flawlessly, Christian Bale surpasses his performance from Batman Begins, and Two-Face feels creepy and very real. The entire move holds true to not what positively could happen, but everything is definitely plausible. The only real question of realism was the Bat Glider, but I can accept that as a possibility. The whole film digs deep into the human mind and takes everything that you accept as good and bad, or right and wrong, and draws into the light and twists it around until you are not quite sure what you'd do in that particular situation. Like whether you'd kill a whole bunch of convicts in order to save your own life and the lives of people around you, or do you sit and wait to see if they will cause you to die, with no knowledge about what will happen if you don't push the button. Unlike many films that I have seen, the Dark Knight has no excess scenes that are simply there to fill in the next hour of your life. Each scene is tremendously important and by the end of the movie, you'll wonder where all the time went because you had such a truly incredible experience that two and a-half hours flew by and with an ending that will make you feel something that no other super-hero movie has ever made me feel before. This is probably my favorite film of all time, a spot that was formerly filled by Apocalypse Now, but Dark Knight has earned the spot."
7444,True,"I find myself bucking the trend a bit with regards to the Dark Knight. It is a very good film but I really struggle to see why so many viewers are going overboard about it. As I write, it is rated, by posters on here, as the best ever film. Frankly, it simply isn't that good.I know it's fantasy but the Joker is not a credible character, or at least his actions are not credible - just how did he manage to plant explosives in every ward in the general hospital? The plot really doesn't hang together with wild leaps in logic such as the Joker knowing that there will be two ships leaving the city, one full of convicts, one of innocents - and he manages to plant huge amounts of explosives on both.And, all this tortured, self-indulgent, soul searching by Batman and his confederates, it just serves to pad the film out and give it airs and graces that it doesn't need. At well over two hours, the film is already much too long and the first hour lacks pace. I'd rather the 'darkness' come across via the plot and the character's actions rather than being force fed it by being told by the characters every few minutes.The special effects are, by today's standards, nothing special. Even his 'toys' are a bit average.Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable film, well worth seeing. Bale is an excellent Batman despite his 'deep throat' voice when he dons the suit. Ledger is also on great form.I just don't see 'The Dark Knight' as a movie that, in 30 years time, will be regarded as one of the top 100 films of all time - let alone the very best of them all."
7445,True,"-Batman has leaped straight out of the comic book pages and into the real world. To compare ""The Dark Knight"" to say the ""Spider-Man"" franchise for example, is almost a joke. The reboot ""Batman Begins"" established Batman in the real world, and now the sequel takes that an entire step forward. ""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a great comic book movie, its a masterpiece. -It's been a little over a day since I've seen ""The Dark Knight"". It really lingers in the mind after a while, even if you're not a big fan of Batman you will be of this future classic crime drama. As I've pondered over the film more and more, I've come to understand it's many complexities. -Since the first film, the mob is getting more and more desperate to launder their cash. Why? Because Batman has been cleaning up the streets and cops and lawyers can no longer be bought. The Joker is employed by the mob to take down the Batman and bring corruption back to Gotham. Until Batman turns himself in, The Joker will continue to kill people. Is Batman a hero? Or just a vigilante looking for self righteousness? -While re watching ""The Prestige"" the other day, knowing the twist ending, it was beautiful to see how well crafted it was. How much little things that may seem like padding are actually hints that apply to the symbolism of the entire film. The same goes for ""The Dark Knight"". Not only is it a good picture that stays true to the characters and stories of Batman, like ""Batman Begins"" did, but its really an artful film. Thats a lot to say for a movie based off of a comic book. -As the credits started to roll I wondered what the plot twist was. I thought to myself ""There must not be one in this film"", little did I know how subtle it was. Upon further pondering I figured it out. Bale replies to Caine in one scene ""Batman has no limits"". That statement is both true and false. The Joker tempts Batman to ""break his one rule"". -Another part of the film that has deep meaning is The Joker. We know from the film that The Joker was somehow abused in the past. So he has lost all faith in people. There is evil in everyone. Two sides one ""coin"". The Joker strives to create dramatic examples. By corrupting Batman, their White Knight, and themselves. ""When it comes down to it, every man for himself, every person is evil"" is his basic logic. The Joker acknowledges that he is morally wrong, but wants to prove it to Batman and everyone else in Gotham that they are not much different from himself (Thats a little Killing Joke for you). -The films puts you into a an exciting roller coaster, and a rather abrupt, yet beautiful ending that will leave you stunned. The story is intelligent and action-packed, it is wonderfully well acted to create great characters, and it really speaks to you. -Batman breaks the law for justice, the city who he protects hates him, and yet he still fights injustice for the right reasons. To keep an eight year old's parents from dying. He will only stop when the evil that created Batman is gone. Thats what a hero is. A+""He's the hero that Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we'll hunt him, because he can take it. Because he's not a hero. He's a silent guardian...A watchful protector...The Dark Knight."""
7446,True,"I never liked Batman. Probably because the former movies weren't strong enough for this character...In my opinion. Inspite of this, when I saw the Trailers of the Dark Knight I was impressed. I said: This is going to be awesome. In our country the day of the premier was yesterday, so in this morning I went to see it with my friends. The beginning was... I think the right word is awesome! When Joker robbed the bank and killed his accomplices...that was brilliant. I mean the way he did that. Heath Ledger was great during the whole movie, the other actors were good too, but he was the best. Every scene was perfect, I was amazed when I left the cinema. The final scene was also perfect, the music, the narration and the footages. To sum up, at last a Movie that Batman (and of course the audience)deserves."
7447,True,"YES! YES! And again YES! This is what we are waiting for since the cult comic ""The killing joke"". That kind of Batman is more darker than Shumacher's version and Tim Burton's classic. OK, Burton made it well. The first Batman and the new one...maybe these are the best comic adaptations(side by side with The Crow). Unbelievable what Nolan made. Perfect, in every way! Batman Begins was the first level, Dark knight is better then Batman ever! Christian Bale is still -maybe- the best Bruce Wayne/Batman with his amazing scary voice as the Dark Knight over Gotham. Jim Gordon played by Gary Oldman(Who was a little bit down in the last few years) is still perfect. Aron Eckhart and Harvey Dent's transformation is perfect in visionary! I Couldn't believe my eyes! The story is more realistic than in the first Nolan movie. It's like a crazy crime story fulled with madness and colored deep DARK. Entertaining, full with action and the characters are very believable. And of course there is Heath Ledger. The best and only Joker forever! He was one of the biggest actors now days, and he couldn't proof it enough...I hope he will become an Oscar in Heaven! R.I.P. So, The Dark Knight is absolutely 10/10, or better! And everyone who's interested in it, go to the Cinemas! It's amazing on big screen! ""Why so serious?!"""
7448,True,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film and, as a summer blockbuster, it certainly doesn't disappoint. If you are looking for well-executed action (though some of it is confusingly edited) solid acting from a good cast and unnerving tension then this certainly is the film for you. Chris Nolan proves to be skilfully adept at maintaining nerve-wracking tension throughout the second half of this film and I was genuinely not sure which characters would still be alive at the end, something which is no mean feat considering the formulaic nature of most modern blockbusters. The overwhelming feeling of dread which pervades this picture has been skillfully created by a director who has managed to seamlessly integrate an excellent sound-track with dark but beautiful cinematography and unusually committed performances from an ensemble cast, the strongest of which coming from Heath Ledger, who manages to invest the Joker with a surprisingly malevolent presence for a summer film.Unfortunately, much of this is undone by a script and story which fails to support the hard-work of both the director and cast. Whilst the film purports to explore deep and disturbing issues relating to madness and heroism, the script isn't half as clever as it thinks it is. Yes, the Joker is vividly painted as an unnerving agent of chaos who's objective is to reveal the dark underbelly of human nature, but the scriptwriter is denied the opportunity to fully explore the questions raised by this character because of the wham-bam demands of summer action movies. The audience is instead subjected to a series of gruelling hostage situations which, whilst effectively intense, are too numerous and unrelenting for the director to explore the psychological effects these scenarios have on the rest of the cast, thus depriving the Joker of much of his potency.Added to this is a ridiculous story which simply fails to adhere to logic or reason. Yes, the Joker is meant to be a criminal mastermind, but even he does not have the power to read the future and many of his schemes are simply impossible to execute. SPOILER The most improbable story development has to be the revelation that the Joker planned all along to be captured by the police mid-film and has already devised a means of escape. The Joker simply has no time to come up with his alternate scheme of taking both Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes hostage any plausible explanations made by fans of the film for many of the plot-twists and turns simply hold no water. SPOILER For a film that prides itself in translating the Batman mythos into a recognisable reality the implausible story only serves to remind the viewer that, despite all of the skill that has gone into developing The Dark Knight, this is only a summer blockbuster after all and it is certainly not the dark masterpiece that many have claimed it to be."
7449,True,"What can be said to truly capture the joy that the Dark Knight brings?I'm not here to echo over everyone's reviewers and go on and on telling you about how great it was. I'll be balanced and fair.THE GOOD:1.) Movie is better than Batman Begins. 2.) Heath Ledger really shines and gives an Oscar worthy performance. 3.) Non-stop entertainment and action. 4.) some decent and unforeseen plot twists. 5.) Great dialogue. 6.) Cool gadgets and effects. 7.) Fantastic direction and music.THE BAD: 1.) Twoface had a very minor role. In fact, Harvey dent was where it was at, Twoface had like 20 minutes of face time....Same as venom in spider man. 2.) The dialogue is great. But some scenes are more monologues between characters, rather than conversations. it's like they're talking at the other characters. and not with them. 3.) somewhere close to the end (the last 20 minutes or so...) The movie begins to slow down and feel a little drawn out. 4.) I wish there'd have been more of an epic struggle between Batman and Joker. 5.) Some would argue the movie is a little lengthy. 6.) Batman's disguised voice can be a bit overwhelming. I thought he was talking that way in Begins because he was finding a comfortable cover...but I guess he has found it and plans to stick with the dark raspy tone he's still using.Over all I think this is a fantastic film and certainly the best comic book movie ever made as of today. I'm sure it'll always stay as a great one that'll withstand the test of time. Though some may disagree. And hey that's cool too.My personal take is that with the exception of a few very minor flaws the movie was sensational and nothing short of perfect. Go see it now if you haven't and see it again if you have. I've seen it 3 times now ^^R.I.P. Heath.I can't wait to buy this movie on Blu-Ray when it is released :-)"
7450,True,"I walked out of this movie thinking one thing- WOW. i don't know if this is the best movie ever, but it's definitely the Best superhero\comic movie. now to the analysis: ACTING Christian Bale- Bale delivers another great show, just like he did in ""Begins"". Out of all the ""Bruce Wayne""s, Bale's Wayne is the one i found it easiest to identify with. His double life as Bruce Wayne, the billionaire playboy, and Batman, the vigilante crime fighter. His dilemma about crossing the rules in order to save the ones you love. i could almost feel what he felt. superb acting, and i can't wait to see him in the third installment Heath Ledger- in a word- PERFECT. unlike Nicholson's comedic, happy joker, Ledger plays the Joker the way he should be- Phsycotic, Selfish and Sadisticly funny. obviously steals the show in each of his scenes. The voice, The clothes, The make-up. just PERFECT.Maggie Gyllenhall- My one disappointment of this movie. IMO, her acting was TERRIBLE. and that's a compliment. you can not imagine how happy I was when she died. Thank god she won't be coming back in the next one.Aaron Eckhart- This guy is a really good actor. the role of the attorney-gone-bad suited him perfectly. Never heard of him 'till now, and i see he has potential.all the side-roll actors(Oldman, Cainee, Freeman) were also very good.Music- Not much to say here. it was good, but could have been dropped off at certain scenes.Plot+Length- Although it was good, the hole LAU story-line could have been easily left out and we would still have a good 2 hour superhero movie. I mean, about 10-15 minutes after the LAU thing ended, i forgot about it. why? because it made no difference in the main plot.OMG moments- the Batpod coming out the Batmobile, The hospital exploding, The truck flipping over and the bank robbery. oh, and the boat and doctors\clowns scenes were DAMN BRILLIANT"
7451,True,"This is my first review in a series of, in theory, 250. Seriously folks I'm gonna watch em all! At the time of this writing The Dark Knight is the number one ranked film on the IMDb. Although one should always be skeptical about the hype and passion that we heap on what is new and novel. This may be one time where the hype was justified. The credit here belongs to Christopher Nolan, who is perhaps the most compelling director of this generation. With Batman Begins, Nolan transformed the comic book film forever and finally gave us the vision of Batman that we had been waiting for. I recently heard a statement (by Kevin Smith I believe) that The Dark Knight follows it's predecessor the way Godfather two follows Godfather one. I'm afraid I couldn't say it better. Dark Knight makes it's claim to individuality by almost negating the thesis of the first film. (as Godfather II does) Nolan's films always seem to revolve around perception and how it is used to create our reality. The first film was about how Batman turned fear on those he has sworn to fight. The Dark Knight is about how Batman has finally found an opponent who can turn his own crusade against the city. The Joker is the first villain who is ""immune"" to Batman's methods. The film sustains constant tension (almost horror) when we realize that the Joker is always 4 steps ahead of our hero. And how do you defeat a villain with no agenda?Heath Ledger delivers everything that was promised. The Joker that Ledger has created is truly an achievement in menace. Every other performance of the character is obsolete. (including the over-hyped, overrated performance by Jack Nicholson). Often the sympathy that comes with dying young leads actors to be over romanticized and over hyped. But this performance even won over the person most likely to be annoyed by unjustified hype (me). The Oscar would be well deserved!Also worthy of mention is the surprising handling of Two Face which is yet another aspect of the Batman story that Nolan has explored in ways that (after HE did it) seemed almost obvious. Which may be the most subtle part of his genius. (although a lot of credit needs to go to Frank Miller and all the writers of the last 20 years who have made the character three dimensional)It should not be at the top of anyone's list of all time films..............but what Nolan has achieved here will be remembered for decades to come. He has upped the ante forever on the sequel in general and the comic book sequel in particular. But more than that.......The Dark Knight is yet another installment in a career that keeps us coming back again and again to be shocked and amazed."
7452,True,"Ever since i saw batman begins i was waiting in anticipation for this movie. I was very interested to see how they would revamp the batman franchise. They went a very different path from Tim Burton but in my a opinion represents the comic book better. This is the best comic booked based film ever, and is the best movie so far in 2008. The opening scene where the Joker robs the mob bank go me hooked right away. The film progresses steadily, and their is never a dull moment. Heath Ledger really steals the show and should be considered for an Oscar as many people are saying. Christan Bale is good as batman again and Maggie Gilenhall is a much better actress than Katie Holmes. And Aaron Eckhart is great as two face. I have heard a few rumors that cat woman will be in the next film, their was a hint in the movie!! The only complaints i have heard about this movie was that it was a little to long. I don't know what could have been cut, everything in the movie was necessary. Although i think it could have been split into two movies with the Joker featured in this one and at the end start two face and then in the second one they could have showed two face get corrupted. But thats just being nit picky i love this film. I have seen it twice and probably will see it more than that."
7453,True,"I'm not a big comic book fan. Even when I was a kid, I thought the idea of leotard wearing vigilantes was kind of dumb. And now that I'm a bit older, I'm having a hard time watching such stuff. It doesn't help that the theaters seem to be clogged with these movies lately, as if nobody in Hollywood can think of a new hook.But The Dark Night is a truly fun ride. It's thrilling from start to finish. It's got a smart plot. Even the super villains act realistically.Having given it a 10, I'm obviously a fan. I did find myself looking at my watch about 1 1/2 hours in, wondering when it was going to end, so I guess it could have used some pruning. But just when I got ready to take a bathroom break, the picture jumped back into high gear and stayed there for the next hour.Good stuff all around and much better than the Tim Burton movies. I'll leave it to others to dissect it in detail. I'm sure there are a million comic book fans here that already have."
7454,True,"I have been in a state of shock since I saw this film last week and I have to say that my anticipation of the film was justified. In a 152 minutes I was given everything that I have ever wanted in a Batman film and more. Heath Ledgers performance as The Joker, was simply amazing. Until you have seen this film you have never really seen the Joker as he should be properly portrayed. As I watching Ledger I could clearly see the graphic novels he read for inspiration and insight in the Jokers mind. And the notable is A Killing Joke. Its the perfect mixture of Fear, slight humour and sinisterness that moulds Ledgers acting into a truly Iconic Performance.But not all the praise should be reserved for Heath. Christian Bale portrayed Bruce Wayne wonderfully in Batman Begins and he has carried the skill into The Dark Knight. This time though rather than Wayne grasping the concept of fear he struggles with his own morality and when to cross the line, if ever.Id hate to call them the supporting cast because this was there film as much as the top billers. But Aaron Eckhart, Micheal Caine, Maggie Gylanhaal and Gary Oldman round off the cast brilliantly.The only complaints i would have with this film is that maybe Two Face should have had bigger part towards the end of the film, but to be honest i cant see how this could of happened without taking the movie's spotlight away from The Joker. And the other would be that maybe it should have been rated a 15(UK) rather than a 12a.Overall this film was well worth the wait... now bring on part 3"
7455,True,"Before you well accredited film critics bash me, hear my side.Batman has always been my favorite superhero of all time. This film dumps all over what is really Batman. In fact I was worried when my idiot ex girlfriend said this movie was, ""amazing."" The girl barley even has a brain. I should know, I dated her. I'm trying to write as little as possible here but come on!1. What is Morgan Freemen doing in this movie!?!! 2. Why the hell is the mayor wearing eye liner and mascara?!?! 3. lol Batman's voice, are you serious!?! 4. No Bat cave!? It's just a large empty room. 5. Batman get's 2,000 TV's rigged up to a sonar within a day with technology he did not create Morgan freemen did. 6. The story moves along about as smooth as sandpaper. 7. The joker bitches about how people go crazy when things don't go according to plan, well this jerk comes up with like 5 flawless plans in this movie! A little far-fetched. I could go on. The joker was great I'll give it that.This movie was horrific, and I can't wait to be bashed because it will just prove that most people in this world have no clue."
7456,True,"It's hard to believe how much hype has surrounded this movie, I tried to put as much of it from my mind as I sat down to watch it in the theater. This film is so much more than a Batman movie, its way more than a super-hero movie and it takes the ""what if batman existed in a fairly realistic world"" idea even farther.As the title would have you believe the movie is Dark, there is pain, loss, death, and a clever twisted villain named The Joker. Ledger's performance, while I don't know if its Oscar worthy, is fantastic. He creates a Joker with a twisted sense of humor and incredibly sharp mind that kept me both smiling and cringing throughout the film. It really hurts me that Ledger won't be back to reprise the role because he and Nolan have created the best Joker incarnation I've ever seen...Batman spends much of movie doing detective work in somewhat futile attempts at stopping the Jokers plot, but what he doesn't understand is that the Joker is no ordinary criminal.The Joker is out to prove something, he's out to prove that the petty sociological and moral rules we as human beings built for ourselves can be easily broken down and therefore proved false. He thrives on chaos and uses the psychological make-up of others to his advantage. He is rarely caught off guard.After watching the film the only flaws I could see were that Batman did not seem to appear in the film as much as I would liked and that they wasted the villain Two Face (though Dent's demise is never 100% established it is meant to be inferred that he is no longer a threat). After all, Two Face is meant to be one of Batman's main villains and they go to the trouble of telling Dent's story extremely well, why not milk the villain for all he's worth?? All I know is I'm waiting for the next installment and hope Nolan, Bale, and Oldman return... This is one of the best movies in a long time. Its dark, clever, tense, and even funny at times... Almost perfect in almost every way, the Dark Knight surpasses the Super-Hero movie stereotypes..."
7457,True,"This is the kind of movie that makes one truly appreciate film making. Going into the movie, I had already been a huge Batman fan. I have seen all of the old movies, and I was expecting good things from this one. First off, I would like to comment on something I am sure everyone has already heard. Heath Ledger. His acting in this movie was the best. He took the character, and made it his own. I love to see actors go above and beyond the task of reading lines, and add in a bit of life. His character was believable, as well as creepy. I know that I personally was affected every time he read a line. He stole the show for me.Secondly, I think that the script was one of the best. True human nature was perfected by it. I also, once again, loved the Joker. His part itself made me fall in love with this movie.The only thing that irritated me was (spoiler) 1. The fact that two-face did not get much screen time 2. And once two-face was made, the movie seemed to drag on a little, and then you realize that it is not the end, and the movie speeds up a little.All in all, this is one of my favourite movies, and everything from the costumes to the characters was superb. 10/10!"
7458,True,"I went to the screening of The Dark Knight yesterday. Expectations: really, REALLY high. When i came out of the cinema i wasn't as stunned as i thought i was going to be. The movie is great, no doubt of it but it was so overrated i cant even explain it. Lets divide it into 3. Start, main action and end. The start is slooow, but its fun. First Joker appearances are at least, funny. Ill try not to spoil anything but his jokes are Bizarre, you cant help laughing sometimes. It seems that it is going to be a nice movie but... nothing happens. In some moment i couldn't detect movie turns from a slow-paced one to an incredible action movie. Now this was what i was expecting for... but the end is not as strong... i needed something more. OK i wont spoil it.Heath Ledger as the Joker was extremely good, but its not greatest villain ever as i read everywhere!!! hes not scary at all... he is just mad, hes not even evil. Just one really madman.Christian Bale as Batman is not that good. When he is bruce wayne its all fine but when he switches to his batman voice is extremely annoying. Get the potato out of his mouth PLEASE!!!!Harvey dent character is nice... Aaron does a good job but Two Face is awful. What the **** is Terminator doing here¿¿?? and hes not even bad! he just wants revenge, doesn't seem bad to me. The rest of the cast is fine... Saying that this is greatest performance of Gary Oldman, Michael Caine or Morgan Freeman is just to insult their brilliant career. They have only a few lines in the movie.The OST is nice, but sometimes it is extremely epic for what we are watching on the screen. For example, harvey dent in his office with one Gladiator epic theme is too much.Scarecrow seems so weak that i think the fat batman could arrest him. I think this movie tries to be so real, and thats the main problem. Everything is real until terminator appearance. Its too weird. And wasted the rest of the movie.Final Words: Nice movie... not flawless, good joker bad two face. Good cast, bad batman. Its definitely not the greatest movie ever but its worth to see it. Sorry for my bad English :P."
7459,True,"Firstly.. Jesus Christ! I was not expecting that! This movie blew me away.Lets start basic natural attraction. This movie had realistic action that was still breath taking. Several scenes, including one with The Joker performing a Magic Trick, are spiced with Brutal violence that will leave you screaming ""OHH F@#%, YOU GOT OWNED"". The Fighting had the same type of realism as The Bourne Series. The Explosions, always jaw dropping. The Driving, Flat out riveting and nail biting. The Intensity of some sequences will leave you speech-less. The Acting, Oh My. What an incredible cast. Every performance was so believably real and just oozed with passion for the role. Every single actor and actress played their designated role flawlessly. Heath Ledger. . . In God's Honest Truth.. Deserves an Oscar for his role. I am not saying this because of him recently passing away, I'm saying this because he was sick, twisted, and deep in his eyes you could see.. He WAS The Joker. He was beyond amazing, not a soul on earth could have done a better job than him.Into the depths of this movie. This movie in general in a say on human's natural instinct. It is a insight into the human soul and the primal instincts of everyone. To put a specific scene into view here I'll refer to the Boat Scene.**SPOILERS**In this scene it is the joker stating to Batman that he can bring out the evil in the world. Joker was pulling the evil in people out into plain view. Shattering peoples appearance and their statements on their own morals. By putting their lives on the line. In Simpler view Joker put a gun to a mans head and said ""i will kill you unless you kill the man in the chair with a bag over his face."" Trying to prove that once humans are rattled and frightened they will let loose there evil and break all rules giving into anarchy and madness, exactly what Joker was striving for. Also in this scene it not only tackles human nature, be two key modern stereotypes. 1: All Convicts are Terrible Murderer's. and the other stereotype 2: View of Convicts from modern citizens. And this scene examines these stereotypes in many ways. When the boats uproar in shouting and screaming, in the heat of the moment, people fighting for the detonator, everyone is ready to blow the other ship. Until people calm down and process the situation, asking themselves if they should take the other peoples lives. This is where the key insight is. That any human in the heat of a moment can make a mistake, but in the human mind all people who can stop and process things, are capable of good, thats is why no one pulled the pin. When not blocked by adrenaline the human mind works wonders and can accept any fate at the cost of what is right and good. People like the Joker cannot do this because they cannot slow down, or make a PLAN. He states that himself whilst talking to Two-Face in the hospital.Then when Joker see's neither ship explode it is hard for him to accept because he was so sure the people on the boat would act in haste and be quick to blow each other away. Though Good prevailed and he caught that glimpse of hope for Gotham and all of mankind, showing that Good and Right still existed in these unfair, dog-eat-dog, modern times.**END SPOILERS**Essentially that is why this movie is so good. Their are many other aspects to this movie as well that make it good, like the music, the filming, the script and much more.This movie is a Master-Piece in every sense.10/10 Dark Knight, You knocked me onto my A**."
7460,True,"wow. just...wow. this movie is so amazing. words cannot describe it. well...i guess i can try my best. so where do we begin. I'm going to start off with the man who is the star of the picture: Christian bale. this man gave so much depth to both Bruce Wayne and batman. you can see the emotions in his eyes and you can also just feel this characters pain. its just madness. bale is and always will be the best batman. now Maggie Gyllenhaal. she gave so much more to Rachel than stone faced Katie Holmes. Maggie made Rachel a tough woman who is not a damsel in distress. Rachel in this movie is someone who can take care of herself and is not afraid. when you see her showing emotion you see emotion. you see a real character. its because of Maggie that i actually like the character of Rachel Dawes now. Gary Oldman. a versatile actor like him needs no words except that he embodied a wholesome character (alright this is in the words of Chris Nolan but the guy is sooooo right). now Aaron Eckhart. Harvey dent/two-face is my second favorite villain of all time and this man got him down. Harvey dent is an American hero and a person who has anger issues *wink**wink* and someone like Aaron was perfect you see someone with this battle of when to cross a line. this Harvey/two-face is the one that not only me but everyone has been waiting for. and last but not least...heath ledger. what can i say. this man got him down. joker is like a pack of playing cards you don't know what he is going to do next. even his voice is like a pack of playing cards being thrown at you there's so much to it. i mean i found myself laughing a few times. who knew black humor can be so funny? heath embodied this character. everything was vintage joker. you cant see heath one bit. its like someone caught a real life joker on camera. Chris Nolan is god. what Bruce Wayne said in batman begins is right. batman is incorruptible, he cant be destroyed. he is the dark knight. the character of batman and this movie of him will live on forever. batman is a savior. batman is a guardian. batman is a legend. and he will live on forever."
7461,True,"For all the hype which surrounded and preceded it, the almost three-hour-long film surely delivered. It was comparable to a never ending roller-coaster ride of various emotions and of crafty mindgames. To say that it was unnecessarily long would be true, but I don't think anyone in the cinema really cared  because every single scene, every little second was essential, entertaining and breathtaking. It was the complete experience which just couldn't be dissected into random facets.The cinematography and the music were very effective. The dark grays which pretty much bordered most of the scenes, the clever editing and the suspenseful pace molded it to become one heck of a great movie.The story was surprisingly complex and intelligent, which is not very common in superhero movies. Distinctive philosophies and opposing personalities came into play in a war of extremes.The character development was very comprehensive and the cast was excellent. Christian Bale was effortlessly Batman and Bruce Wayne once again, silent, dashing, troubled and cunning. (I still hate Batman's scary raspy robotic voice though.) He was indeed the flawed hero. Much has been said about Heath Ledger's performance as the psychotic and merciless Joker, and you especially ought to see it for yourselves. He was funny, creepy, alarming, perplexing and everything else in between. He was subtle and he was overpowering... He totally owned it down to the random flicks of his tongue.Maggie Gyllenhaal was initially a turn off as I felt as if the role of Rachel Dawes didn't suit her for some reason, but she grew on me. It was funny though how it seemed as if she was acting as ""Katie Holmes"" and not as ""Rachel Dawes"". Aaron Eckhart was excellent as District Attorney Harvey Dent but was somewhat a disappointment as Two-Face. I'm not sure if Heath Ledger merely upstaged him as a villain, but something was certainly lacking in Two-Face. Perhaps more personality, more polarity  he was Two-Face after all. Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine were also notable in their subdued minor roles.I was never a comic book fan, but if there ever was a movie that in all honesty made me want to be one  it would have to be The Dark Knight. (Though some say it was quite different from the comic.) With its complexity, its gritty action, its genuine characters, its resolute intelligence and its incredible tragedy, it was something that leaves one breathless. Exhausted even.Sure, the movie had it flaws  but seriously, I don't think anyone would even dare to nitpick.It was intimate and yet epic, it was exhilarating and yet heartbreaking. I would absolutely watch it again."
7462,True,"I thought that this film was fantastic. From Ledgers unrecognizable and amazing performance of the joker(he embodied the character very well) to Christian Bale maintaining form from 'Begins'. Maggie G was an excellent choice for Rachael and did a far better job than Katie Holmes. Michael Caine as Alfred has great comic timing but knows how to play serious as well.Cillian Murphys small role in the film was a good decision by Nolan. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey/Two face was intense, he surpassed all expectations i had of his skill.Ledgers presence on screen is powerful and a little scary at times, but the slightly morbid jokes of his are perfect. He almost overshadows the entire film because he is just so insane on screen.My Favourite movie so far this year. RIP Ledger. Congratulations to Nolan for making such a fantastic movie."
7463,True,"This film was more like an experience than a movie. Leaving the theater, I felt as though I had just witnessed an event. It left me drained the way Indiana Jones did but emotionally as well as physically.I have read IMDb reviews by people who hated this movie, and I'll admit there are a couple of things I was confused about. First of all, I never understood why the Joker maintains he has no financial motive, yet asks the gangsters for half of their money as his cutperhaps that was just another one of his mind tricks. And I completely disagree with people who think Christian Bale is the best Batman ever. He sounded more like a superhero with a sinus infection through the whole movie. Bale was upstaged by everyone, not the least of which being Heath as a completely believable and compelling psychopath. What a performance! I don't much respect actors and acting rarely impresses me, but wow! If you don't believe that his performance was one of the greatest you've ever seen, watch the first 7 minutes of the film closely (the bank robbery scene). Now tell me this: if all the bank robbers are wearing masks, how come we know which one the Joker is? It's because we got a sense of it through the body language, the mannerisms, the way he walked and the way his head was slumped low to the shoulders. That was all acting. That was all Heath.Kudos to the pencil trick as wellthe whole theater jumped back in sync. Watching 500 silhouettes lean back in their seat simultaneously was a timeless moment for me."
7464,True,"This is definitely the best Batman ever (also if I say this after every single part, except Schumacher's trials). It's so impressive in what awesome way Nolan broach the issue of the theme 'good and bad'. He shows the option of a good person to choose the bad or the good site and also the choice of a bad person to decide between the good or the bad in different ways. And another interesting point is that Nolan reveal this theme in the person of ""Two-Face"" in the movie and in that way create a famous character in the middle of the movie and let him expire till the end of the film. His handling with Batmans heroism is also exciting. He extract it in such a special way! Batman become that what Gotham needs, not what Gotham require to keep Batman as a superhero. By watching ""The Dark Knight"" with this background make this movie the next step for Nolan to be the best director in present and get the next level after ""Memento"" or ""Insomnia"". At least I must mention that the cast is also very great. Ledger as The Joker, Oldman as Det. Lt. Gordon, Freeman as Lucius Fox or Christian Bale are definitely the best actors for this special parts."
7465,True,"I remember an evening about two years ago, when I sat down with some friends to watch Batman Begins. A ways into the movie, I remarked on how creepy Cillian Murphy managed to make the Scarecrow, a character that has always been difficult to actually make scary. One friend replied, ""He's still not as creepy as Jack Nicholson as the Joker."" Said another companion, ""Few things in this world are.""This, of course, was months before the first teaser for the Dark Knight had been released. And it was nearly two years before my friend found out how wrong he was.I'm probably not going to say anything here that hasn't already been said hundreds of times. Bale, Eckhart, Gyllenhaal, and Oldman all deliver. I save special praise for Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, two actors who are nearly impossible to make look bad. It is Caine's stirring speech, that ""Some men just want to watch the world burn,"" that manages to define the Joker far better than any of his actions.But, then again, the Joker's pretty damn awesome.I won't heap praise on Ledger; there are enough people doing just that. What I find with the Joker is that I don't actually think of him as an actor playing a role. He isn't Ledger, he just *is* the Joker. I imagine him sitting in his trailer between shoots sharpening his knives and touching up his make-up. He dominates every scene he's in; his warbling voice and nervous tics(count how many times he licks his lips) are unnerving and get you right on the edge of your seat. The pencil trick in his dealings with the mob is surprisingly funny. It takes several seconds for the whole thing to sink in; the Joker has already said ""Ta-daa! It's gone!"" before the first person in the theater lets out an unsuccessfully contained laugh. With many good movie villains, you find yourself at some point in the film rooting for them. You want them to win, if only for a moment. Not so with the Joker. You're dreading his victory from the start: your heart pounds in terror as you hope you don't see the grenade go off in the bank manager's mouth, horror fills you as you see the LCD screen of the cell phone light up underneath the badly applied stitches of one of the Joker's henchmen, and you dread seeing hostages disguised as clowns get shot down by SWAT team members. But, of course, he doesn't win, not completely. The actions of the ferry passengers prove that people aren't as twisted as he believes, and he is arrested, even denied Harvey Dent's fall from grace from making Gotham's citizens lose hope. As tragic as Ledger's death is, his performance in this movie might just be amazing enough to prevent Nolan from casting a look-alike to take his place in part three. We can only hope."
7466,True,"The Dark Knight has to be, by far, one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is definitely my favorite movie of all time. The performances were phenomenal, especially the late Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. His performance alone could make the movie. Christian Bale as Batman is not just as good as Batman Begins, it is a thousand times better. Michael Caine and Gary Oldman reprise their roles as Alfred and Commissioner Gordon, and are better than before. The Dark Knight is much more of a crime drama than a full fledged action flick, but is still excellent. The Joker is terrorizing the city of Gotham and finally sets into motion, his plan to bring chaos and anarchy to the city. As he does this, Harvey Dent played by the awesome Aaron Eckhart, helps try to bring the city hope alongside Batman and Gordon. Eventually, though, Dent becomes twisted in his ways of chance and because of the Joker becomes Two-Face. All in all, this movie is not just the best of this summer, but one of the greatest movies of all time."
7467,True,"Christopher Nolan surprised us very much with ""Batman Begins"" in 2005. A great story, a great Batman, a great everything. All of these and more.""The Dark Knight,"" is better than ""Batman Begins."" If I could, I would give this a 20/10. It's that good. The late Heath Ledger blew me right out of the water with his performance. It still lingers with me, and is much better than Jack Nicholson's. I'll cast in my vote for his posthumous Oscar nomination. Also, there is a political side to it, where everyone is in fear of what the Joker will do; a symbol of the terrorist attacks, and where our politicians are corrupted; Harvey Dent aka ""Two-Face,"" who's much better than Tommy Lee Jones'.However, don't take your kids to see this. It's quite disturbing, especially with the Joker and Two-Face. I can also see a third one being made, which I most definitely see."
7468,True,"Ah yes, this well-spoken piece of film. Lets see if I can express my feelings about it in a readable way. Here I go;First things first, there are two things I want to get clear before discussing the movie. 1) I haven't seen any Batman movies at all. I myself don't reckon it makes much of a difference to my opinion on this one, but just saying. 2) I am not going to discuss whether this movie is 'good' or 'bad'. Looking at the strictness of the IMDb ratings, this one probably deserves an 8. Keep in mind that whatever comes next, this movie is definitely worth seeing; you wíll be entertained.Alright, that said, where do I begin? I suppose mentioning that Heath Ledger's role as the joker is beyond stunning is a good start. I've never really bothered with Batman, and such I only knew ""The Joker"" as ""The bad guy from the Batman universe"". To me, Heath has given the Joker a face. His performance is far beyond 'good'... The Joker is shown to the viewer as a somewhat insane, psychotic criminal who is still believable. I'm not sure why, but I like the character. The Joker leaves a mark.Aside from that, I really enjoyed the tension in the movie. Most of the time, it was hard to guess what was going to happen next... You are kept wondering about what's up throughout the whole movie, and there was actually only one major plot change that I was able to predict (by knowing the length of the movie). Of the maybe 6 or 7 major plot changes, that's a fairly nice score.Last, I have to mention there's precisely the right amount of explosions in the movie. It was close to being a Hollywood special-effects show-off film, but the movie strayed far enough to avoid becoming one.Alright; having spilled the good parts, lets get onto the bad aspects of the movie.First of all; why did Batman sound like a German pornstar? I realize a 'voice changer' would be part of his usual equipment, but the 'new' voice that came out of him was just... odd. It might be personal preference, but I reckon it didn't really fit him.Second, what's up with Harvey Two-face? Is there any real reason why he went 'bad'? Either I'm missing something in the story or it's just plain weird... The only reason for him to turn his back on Batman was that the Joker killed his girlfriend. If he had any sense of logics left he would've killed the Joker when he got the chance, rather than turning bad for such an awful reason.Third, there's a bunch of odd goofs in the movie. At one part Batman hides Dent in a building the Joker infiltrates, and later jumps out of the window to save his 'girlfriend'... Leaving the Joker in the building to find Dent. Beats me why he didn't actually do so. Then there's the part where the Joker seems to have an endless supply of TNT, dynamite, and army-bazookas. Sure, it's a superhero movie, but at least Batman's powers are explained trough his suit. Absolutely no reason is given as to why the Joker manages to fill up half the city and two giant boats up with explosives without anybody noticing or him running out of bangbang. And then I'm not even mentioning the fact that all the clowns seemed to be loyal to him for absolutely no reason; one of them even stops another Mafioso from preventing the Joker burning a pile of money, the only thing that would explain why the Joker has these over-loyal employees. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention the joker somehow manages to take a knife with him into custody. Are the policemen totally stupid or just incompetent? This, I suppose, is what breaks the movie for me. It's a superhero movie, sure. But the superhero is fairly realistic. Everything else in the movie is not. If you think twice about everything that happens in the film, you just start rubbing your chin and wondering why half these things are possible.In the end, I'm still feeling twisted about this movie. By all means, go watch it, it's good. Just not worth number one in a top 250. Even though I reckon about 200 movies in the top 250 are overrated, this one shouldn't be on number one. The film is a movie which gets several aspects right, but not perfect. If you think the psychological aspect of the story is good, go watch Fight Club. If you think the fights and plot were what makes the movie worth a 10, go watch the Borne trilogy. If you think the tension was good, go watch Hitchcock. The Dark Knight is like a Ferrari; very enjoyable to play around with, but not the most amusing thing out there unless you're a fan of the brand."
7469,True,"Epic.I went in with excited trepidation. I was positive about this film off the strength of Batman Begins, however I was careful about the reviews I had read due to what happened with Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.However, this film has surpassed all my expectations. During certain scenes, my jaw dropped, and hit the floor. And stayed there. The reason? Heath Ledger as the Joker. There was only split-second occurrences when I saw Ledger the actor, because his portrayal of the Joker was something that I hoped would have happened  he played it exactly as I imagined. I would saw that the performance of the Joker was true to the Graphic Novels in the sense that the Joker gets a sick, masochistic fascination and finds humour in torture and destruction. That's the Joke, except only he finds it funny.The action and special effects, though great, was not overcooked like you would find in any Die Hard or Stallone film, the narrative did not falter, and you felt for the characters. You could say that The Joker characterisation outshines Bale as Batman, but without the Joker as his foil, his equal, then Batman is just another 'unstoppable' anti-hero. This is depicted when the Joker says to quote ""You just couldn't let me go could you? This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. You truly are incorruptible aren't you? You won't kill me out of some misplaced sense of self-righteousness, and I won't kill you, because you're just too much fun. I think you and I are destined to do this forever."" I left the cinema with a pure emotive choked feeling. I never get this involved in a movie. Some movies make people cry, but then it is the scene, the acting and the music especially that all play a part. But this was something else. I got seriously involved. It perplexed me, it hooked me in, and I was captivated. I will not see this movie twice like some people have because I know that I will begin to anticipate what will come next, which in turn will deflate the feelings I had when I saw it.I personally don't think that Heath Ledger should get a posthumous Oscar, because an Oscar does not a film or actor make. He should be recognised for the fact that as his last full performance, this will be treasured in the minds of everyone. Ledger would much rather know that his performance would have profoundly affected another human being and not based on some golden statuette.This film deservedly garnered critical acclaim and for a 'comic-book movie' actually does stand up against some of the top films ever created such as 'The Godfather series' and 'Shawshank Redemption' (See IMDb's top 250 films list: http://www.imdb.com/chart/top?tt0468569) Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, Gary Oldman and Michael Caine are all British. The cream of the crop. I am not suggesting that there are not excellent American actors and filmmakers, but we Brits know how to do real gritty drama, emotion, among others, that works well in an American environment. It is the outsider influence. The outcast.The movie is based on the Graphic Novel entitled ""Batman: The Long Halloween"" which featured the Scarecrow and the Joker, and was written by Jeph Loeb, famous for writing the TV series ""Smallville"", ""Lost"" and ""Heroes"". In the same was that ""Batman: Year One"" by Frank Miller was the basis of Batman Begins, it is the Graphic Novel format that contained a far superior story arc than the usual continued monthly series. Frank Miller's work has influenced many, and he has rejuvenated many a comic book character and created many epic narratives such as Daredevil, 300 and Sin City  that also became excellent movies.This is the best movie of 2008, if not of the decade, only because nothing has come this close to perfection."
7470,True,"First of all, pardon my language. I'm finnish, so my writing may seem funny at times. There may be some spoilers, but I try not give the whole movie away (edit: I edited in some thoughts I have now when the whole trilogy is finished).I managed to avoid most of the hype before seeing this film. I just knew that people were very excited about this film and everyone was talking about Heath Ledger and his death. Just before I went to a theater, I found out that ""the Dark Knight"" had topped Godfather in ratings. Glad I didn't read any comments about this movie though, so I just turned off my computer and went to see this one with my cousin, knowing little of what to expect.After about 2,5 hours, I was confused. I knew I liked what I saw, and there were many great scenes, 1-on-1 conversations, good performances, great action, and almost anything you'd expect from Nolan's second Batman-flick. But still, I felt like I needed to think about what I just saw, because it didn't just click the way I wanted it to. It was never boring, and the film has so much stuff in it, so it's hard to handle it all if you just see it once. So I thought about it, discussed about it, and it just made me want to see this movie again, which I will do - and probably many, many times. I'm getting there, to the part where it all ""clicks"".Now, I'm not going to compare this one to Spider-Man 3, but I gotta say one thing. Both films have numerous sub-plots, more than one villain, and scenes that could've been just taken away. Spider-man 3 basically sucked because of that, it was too much of a mess. Now, ""The Dark Knight"" did much better and succeeded in bringing many little things together, without taking away the dark mood of the film. I was not happy with everything, so let's get it over with (some minor spoilers ahead): What I didn't like: Did the movie really need another villain? I think not. Maybe it could've worked better if the transformation from a good guy to a bad guy hadn't been rushed. I just didn't believe it. I liked how he looked and all, but I didn't believe the total transformation process at all. It seemed it was crammed into a movie that had already too much going on.The ""batman"" voice. I can somehow deal with it, no problem there, but why must Batman use his alter ego-voice when he's speaking to someone who knows who he is? It takes me out of the movie every time.Scarecrow in the beginning, he was just another punk. Why handle a notable villain like that? What was the point? (same thing in TDKR) Nolan is not an action director, and it shows at times. Some fights don't have the impact they should, be it from camera work or quick cuts or the overall design.-----------What I liked: The Cast. The performances. Of course I got to say what everyone else has already said a thousand times: Heath Ledger was...he was so great. Every little move he made, every stare, every time he quickly licked his lips, every tone in his voice....greeeat. And I didn't even mention the freaky make-up. I try to see his performance without any death-bonus here, and I think I can safely say that Heath stole the show. Bale was OK and fits well to both roles, he did a decent job, but of course there was no chance for him to throw a million different facial expressions in this role. And because Bale was ""just"" OK, it left plenty of room for Caine(especially), Freeman and Oldman to be great as supporting characters for our hero. Gyllenhaal was more believable than Holmes, too. The lighting, cameras, sounds, action, effects, whew. Technically, ""The Dark Knight"" is top-notch. No question about it. The plot, or plots, had many surprising elements to them (funny, how the same thing didn't work for me in TDKR). It made you think about morals from many different points of view.It has several memorable scenes and powerful lines you can quote for the rest of your life. In many ways, the movie as a whole is worse than the scenes it delivers. ""Batman Begins"" is more intact as a film for me, but lacks these powerful scenes.To put it shortly: arguably the best Batman-movie to date. ""Batman Begins"" is certainly more whole as a story, but this one has more memorable scenes. TDKR disappointed me, but at least I have these two to choose from. Ledger, rest in peace."
7471,True,"In my opinion, the best Batman movie and the best comic-book adaptation ever. Mature, engaging and complex. Shades of Frank Miller's work and nods to Batman's darker origins as envisaged by Bob Kane.I love the character contrasts in this movie. Alfred is a great foil for Bruce Wayne. Gordon is a great foil for Harvey Dent.The movie has its roots in comics, so I can forgive the occasional lapse in realism - the 'skyhook' rescue - and it all looks spectacular and I never expected realism in the first place.Performance wise, the movie is hard to fault. From 'Zeus' as one of the prisoners - surprisingly good, to Eric Roberts - again, surprisingly good, through to the leads. A million other people will comment on Heath Ledger, so I won't go on too much about him, but he is stunningly brilliant. A twitching, clicking, off the wall performance. My favourite scene? The Joker leaning out the cop car window and all you hear is the wind rushing past him. Absolutely captures the Joker's anarchic world.Christian Bale captures the struggle of Batman's dark side and his faith in humanity wonderfully. Tortured but ultimately good. Christopher Nolan wisely chooses not to overplay the gore. There is plenty of violence but not much blood. Sometimes things are best left 'suggested' rather than graphically displayed. This may have been done for rating purposes, but for me, it works.A superb piece of cinema."
7472,True,"well, this my first review so, be kind..i saw tdk today morning only. but, i would say i myself didn't believe those hypes and nosies about the movie. after watching it i can say just one thing OMG it surpassed every hype and all those expectations i can think of...!it was nearly, not to say that i am exaggerating but i felt like a a experience of lifetime . every scene was ,every shot every frame was well placed and showed . i didn't expected that much from it but, it just blow-ed me away. the scene where joker do's his pencil magic was where you feel the HL . you just can't think anything else but, just keep staring at his brilliance..in, it was or is the best Hollywood flick i had watched recently and i advise repeated watching of tdk...waiting for next Mr.Nolan"
7473,True,"As is always to be expected with any sequel to a blockbuster, there was a high list of hopes any moviegoer upon entering 'The Dark Knight'. It does not disappoint.The acting in this film is top notch, everyone holds their own and not a single character is misappropriated, nor misplayed. Christian Bale holds the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman so perfectly one can even see the fragments of his own persona break through. There is the 'Billionaire Playboy', the 'Business Executive', the 'Truthful Friend', and finally 'the Dark Knight'all incredible truth in the life he leads, the faces he puts on. It is (as it should be) hard to tell which face is the true Bruce Wayneand Christian Bale creates that reality perfectly.Michael Caine is not to be unnoticed. Not as prominently on screen as in 'Begins'he still ads the sense of reality to Bruce's egothe restraining and fatherly figure the film would fail without.It is a true shame that Heath Ledger left us so soon, too soon a widely unappreciated actor with a masterful performance in both 'Knight' and 2005's 'Brokeback Mountain'. He isunrecognizable in 'Knight', portraying a character that is both terrifyingly chilling and hysterically funny at the same time. In fact, albeit the scene he is in without make-up, I am only able to tell once that it is indeed Heath Leger behind those scars and that face paint(perhaps due to the angle of the shot)Not a single actor does falls from the category of a true performance, including the characters that played slightly lesser roles than in 'Begins' shine. Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, give powerful performances even Cillian Murphy with a brief appearance. The only laugh I have to share has nothing to do with the film directly. All I can do is snicker when I think of Katie Holmes' choice to not reprise her role as Rachel Dawes due to her choice of 'parenting time'. When, in the same instance she was all too happy to play in this year's 'Mad Money'which plummeted faster into oblivion cast to a list film professors will label as 'Films to never emulate'. All I can say is THANK YOU, CHRISTOPHER NOLAN. The amount of gushing realism that pours from this movie is enough to deem it possible. And that is the EXACT intent of Nolan.I have rarely seen a single movie for which I cannot find criticism. It is the time, effort, and determination put in by everyone that drives this movie. The best part (in my humble opinion) is how the film treats itself. Nolan's vision is very similar to my own, and many others. Good, evil, right, wrongare all points of views based temporarily on social norms and constraints. Villains don't view what they do as wrong, they do what they feel is right. The characters who are the 'bad guys' are just as redeemable and likable as those who are 'good guys'and this is based on your perception alone. There is not a line that is uttered from the Joker's mouth that isn't truea most chilling fact that awakens 'the debate' within every one of us.The Joker: ""I took Gotham's white knight, and brought him down to our level. It wasn't hard. Y'see, madness, as you know, is like gravity. All it takes is a little...push."" 10/10"
7474,True,"It is rare that I am reluctant to leave a theater. Especially after sitting for over 3 hours (30 minutes before the film started). Usually, when I witness a great film, I enjoy the movie and then hit the aisles before the end credits have completed.Not this time.From beginning to unfinished end, this film ranks with ""The Godfather"" as one of the greatest pure works of cinema ever achieved. And I do not mean to diminish the likes of ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Ben Hur"" or ""The Lord of the Rings"" by including this film in their company. While those films were most definitely more epic in scopetaking place over a much longer period of time with infinitely more story to tellChristopher Nolan and his crew have pulled off a modern miracle with this opus. Themes of good and evil play out during the 2 1/2 hour running time, through differing variations, with characters forced into dire scenarios, and action so kinetic and virile that you will barely have time to recover.And speaking of the characters, the film realizes them so fully that they approach mythical proportions. There is a lot at stake, not the least of which is the end of life as we know it via the Joker. He is a terrorist without a conscience, and enjoys chaos. And suffering. And his manipulations know no bounds, as we witness late in the film during the murder of a key character. This film evokes heart-rending tragedy on a grand scale. And Heath Ledger should win an Oscar.And yet, the tragedy is counter-balanced with cleanly-cut, beautifully-shot action sequences that will bring you out of your seat. One scenewhich I will never forgetinvolves an 18-wheeler and the Batpod (a glorious invention), and I was so thrilled at the propulsion of this sequence that I yelled out involuntarily at the scene's climax. This movie will gather you up in its momentum and carry you away...it is that good.And so, by the end of the film when the credits were rolling, I just continued to sit. I sat until the final note of music was played, and until the final name crawled off the top of the screen, so that the only thing left to display was the MPAA rating page. The lights came on and the ushers were beginning their cleaning duties.And I still did not want to leave.This is one hell of a movie."
7475,True,"I knew this film was going to be exceptional following Christopher Nolan's last film. But this film does break the usual curse of sequels being worse than originals.Having introduced the characters and setup with the first film, Nolan has improved and progressed the story. An outstanding film in all respects.OK the downside get that out of the way first. It needs editing. It doesn't sustain it over two and half hours length. And that is the only problem. Everything else is just right. Right down to some small touches that Nolan has included that are a mark of a true film maker. Touches that the likes of Hitchcock would have included.Of the acting, Everything has been said about Ledger and would be superfluous to add any more. Christian Bales Batman is very good and there is room for improvement. I'd like to see the direction he goes with the next film.Michael Caine does a greats turn as the Alfred the Butler alongside Morgan Freeman. Together they provide added gravitas to an already very dark film. Gary Oldman continues to grow and grow as an actor. He's a real bonus to this film.Very pleased to see Nestor Carbonell and Eric Roberts appearing in a film of this stature too.What was disappointing was the under use of some actors in a film that last over two and half hours. In particular Tommy Lister, who is listed as just 'Prisoner' but as ever gave a great performance and the British stage actor, parapsychologist, engineer Stephen Armourae. I had just seen a preview of his next play, 'Under the Veil' in which he plays a psychotic Conscience. Evil, threatening combined with manic attack. Then I saw 'The Dark Knight'. Really scary response as Armourae and Ledger are more than somewhat similar. Added to this the word about Armourae's next film 'Children of Baal' is that he's playing a satanist in a style reminiscent of Anthony Hopkins and Brian Cox's Hannibal Lecter. He needs to be screen tested if the Joker returns in the next film; and his fame needs to rise considerably to be an option as the Joker.Aaron Eckhart has received enough praise for his amazing performance. Its also a pivotal performance as he is struggles between virtue and doing what is the most expedient. He is a metaphor of the dual nature of Batman and the Joker's struggle. I have the impression they are setting him u0p for a future Two-Face. Maybe Two-Face results fro a schizophrenic breakdown? The script and effects are fantastic. It is the film of the year so far"
7476,True,"Everyone who are looking for a good story, great actor performances and great action sequences without noticing CGI, have to go and see this BIG movie that is THE DARK KNIGHT ! The movie last about 2h35 min but at anytime you will look at your watch, the film is very well paced.The music is quite the same than Batman Begins but enhanced in a good way and especially used at the right time in the film. Like that moment when you discover the BatPod (one of my favorite moment and one of the most thrilling scene of the film).Every characters is well developed and have their moment, even Michael Caine. And one of the thing i love the most in this movie is that intelligent speech which came out of it, especially about hiding truth to preserve good.So Why i give it a 9 out of 10 ? Only because of little tiny flaws that i noticed like the moment when Batman rescues Rachel and fall of the building to crash on a roof car without any big damages for him or Rachel. Dude ! You will have been dead !! The movie is not perfect and is not better than GODFATHER. Don't Exaggerate people !! I loved it too but hey..!? But when you look at the whole film, you come out of the theater with a big smile on your face because you just witness an incredible story very well directed and not to mention the best performance you have ever seen in a comic book movie: Heath Ledger who deserves an Oscar nomination right now!! GO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW !!"
7477,True,"""Batman Begins"" writer & director Christopher Nolan's new Caped Crusader saga ""The Dark Knight"" qualifies as too much of a good thing. In other words, the movie boasts greater ambitions than its lengthy 152 minutes can accommodate. Mind you, ""The Dark Knight"" is every bit as good as ""Batman Begins."" The chief difference is that this Batman sequel flaunts bigger and better production values as well as loftier aims.Not only does ""The Dark Knight"" align our hero with Bob Kane's original vigilante creation, but it also reinvents the Batman's nefarious nemesis, the Harlequin of Hatethe Joker. The Joker drives Batman over the edge! He ranks as an unforgettable villain. While Nolan and his brother Jonathan remain faithful to the spirit of Kane's Batman, this sequel indulges in derring-do more outlandish and audacious than its predecessor and depicts the showdown between Batman and the Joke as a duel of titans.During its initial two hours, this white-knuckled, larger-than-life, adventure epic keeps you on the edge of your seat. Unfortunately, it sacrifices that momentum in the last 30 minutes with a convoluted subplot that turns into a predictable and pretentious mediation on good citizenship. Although Batman has been around since 1939, the Nolan brothers deserve kudos for taking this unique American crime fighter to the next level. Furthermore, amid all the adrenaline-laced activities and high octane explosions, the Nolans have concocted a crackerjack near-classic with more on its mind that hair-raising heroics.""The Dark Knight"" opens with an imaginative bank robbery. Gun-toting, clown-faced robbers kill each other as each completes their phase of the crime. The hold-up and the getaway are nimbly staged, except there's an inherent flaw. If you think about it, how can the Joker recruit high-class henchmen if he has them knock each other off? Nevertheless, we learn quickly that the Joker is the ultimate anarchist. He refuses to play by the rules, and the Nolans generate a lot of melodrama about Batman's vigilante efforts to apprehend him. ""Hancock"" beat ""The Dark Knight"" to the punch about the price of vigilantism. Not only do the authorities want to catch the Joker, but they also wouldn't mind nabbing the Batman.Incorruptible Lieutenant Jim Gordon (a mustached and bespectacled Gary Oldman of ""True Romance"") is the only cop that Batman trusts. Naturally, Gordon is reluctant to let crusading Gotham City District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart of ""No Reservations"") into the loop. Although the mobsters have been piling up loot, laundering it, and then hiding it in Gotham's banks with a Chinese gangster Lau (Chin Han of ""3 Needles"") protecting their earnings, Batman and Lt. Gordon devise a clever way to identify mob money. Inevitably, the Asian mastermind skips Gotham for the sanctuary of China where he expects to escape extradition. Batman shocks Lau with a surprise visit. The Caped Crusader's excursion beyond Gotham City constitutes a first for the film franchise. Batman's abduction of the Asian crime lord resembles similar abductions from the John Wayne Vietnam war movie ""The Green Beret"" and the Timothy Dalton 007 caper ""License to Kill."" No sooner have the authorities jailed Lau than the Joker approaches Gotham City's criminal cartel with a new plan. The Joker's first scene where he makes a pencil disappear is hilarious. Meanwhile, since Wayne Manor melted down in ""Batman Begins,"" our hero has had to relocate to make-shift quarters. Bruce Wayne realizes that Batman is something bigger than he had imagined, including the copycat Batmen prowling the city. Being the Batman, as ""The Dark Knight"" shows, is no picnic. Our hero has acquired his share of bruises, wounds, and dog bites, and he has his top man at Wayne Enterprises, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman of ""Unforgiven""), developing a dog-proof Bat suit. Despite his crime busting exploits, Bruce yearns for the day that he can drop the masquerade and wed childhood sweetheart Rachel Dawes. The nihilistic Joker doesn't give him much breathing room in this installment.Warner Brothers, DC Comics and the Nolan brothers will have to manufacture a miracle to top this slam-bang, gravity-defying actioneer. Christian Bale surpasses Michael Keaton, George Clooney, and Val Kilmer as Batman. Bale's Batman is more realistic, more sympathetic, and the Welsh star's lean wolfish looks make him look treacherous. In short, Bale is the best Batman since Adam West! The late Heath Ledger really gets under the clown make-up as the Joker. Aaron Eckhart's vigorous performance as Harvey Dent is no less sterling. Alas, the Nolans give Dent the short shrift when they shoehorn his dramatic makeover carelessly in the final half-hour. Leggy Maggie Gyllenhaal isn't much of an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Composers Hans Zimmer and John Newton Howard provide a powerful, atmospheric orchestral score that sets the mood and accentuates the cliffhanger heroics. At the same time, Christopher Nolan wastes no time getting the action in gear. Nolan maintains momentum and suspense while scattering surprises throughout the mayhem. Only during the last 30 minutes does the story begin to unravel. No, ""The Dark Knight"" isn't the masterpiece that ""Iron Man"" was, but this latest entry in the Batman franchise proves you can have your Cape and eat it, too!"
7478,True,"OK, here's the deal.I may not have seen Brokeback Mountain, but I don't have to. I already know that Heath Ledge deserves an Oscar nomination. I was honestly moved by his performance in this stylish, sophisticated movie.The first time I watched this I felt like a child again. I couldn't stop thinking about how incredible this movie was. Then, I watched it again. I'll be honest, there were some flaws, but not many. I could have done without the cellphone/sonar crap, but i'll let it slide. This is a great movie.There are so many reasons to love it and so few to hate it. First of all, Ledger deserves an Oscar nomination for this movie. I can't help but replay over and over his scene with Batman when he is hanging upside-down. Points to the Nolans for great dialogue and to Ledger for executing it perfectly.This movie is one to remember.Ledger is spectacular, Bale is fantastic as always, and Eckert is a wonderful addition. I have always loved the first Batman, but this is a new Joker. For the first time we see a villain that is completely insane, a foil for Batman.This movie surpasses Batman Begins and becomes the best superhero movie ever. I loved Ironman, but this is deeper, darker, and entirely to much fun.I am excited for a possible third movie and hope everyone else is too. This is a dream I never thought would come true. A legitimate, Oscar contender.Seriously, see this movie, you won't be disappointed. Bravo. I can't wait to see what's next."
7479,True,"...and franchise sequels have a potential new king as well. Writer/director Christopher ""Memento"" Nolan, in concert with brother Jonathan ""The Prestige"" Nolan and David S. ""Jumper"" Goyer, has crafted a powerful script for the Batman this time around, one that gives the caped crusader plenty of existential questions to ponder, as well as two superbly (and perhaps definitively) refurbished arch villains to battle. Fanboys are currently beside themselves with joy, and the general movie-going demographic has responded in droves to enjoy this midsummer night's dream. Kudos to all involved.If nothing else, ""The Dark Knight"" enshrines Heath ""Clowning Around"" Ledger's swansong performance as Joker. It's a portrayal of anarchic evil that fascinates and repels, and ought surely draw a posthumous Oscar nomination. The man assuredly went out on a high note. The rest of the acting is nearly as strong: Christian ""American Psycho"" Bale wears the Batman cowl with grim authority, Aaron ""Thank You For Smoking"" Eckhart perfectly limns the transformation of white knight district attorney, Harvey Dent, to dark avenger, Two-Face. Maggie ""Secretary"" Gyllenhaal as the third side of the love triangle with Dent and Bruce Wayne makes one instantly forget Katie Holmes in ""Batman Begins."" Gary ""Sid and Nancy"" Oldman is rock solid as Lt.-soon-to-be-Commissioner Gordon, Batman's police ally, while the rest of the ensemble turns in equally assured performances. Truly, only a determined curmudgeon could fault the acting in ""The Dark Knight."" Production values are equally impressive. Nolan's mainstay DP, Wally ""Memento"" Pfister captures the director's vision perfectly, Lee ""The Truman Show"" Smith, another Nolan collaborator, edits with fine control of pace and comprehensibility, and consummate composers Hans ""Batman Begins"" Zimmer and James Newton ""King Kong"" Howard craft a strong, schizophrenically evocative score. The production design, art direction, costuming, and set decoration are all letter-perfect; the audience is totally and immediately immersed in the dark realities of Gotham ""No, it's New York!"" City, and briefly, the glittering beauty of Hong Kong. The superb visual and special effects are the icing on a film in which every dollar was obviously well-spent.Now, all that said, ""The Dark Knight"" is not without faults, keeping me from giving it a full ""10"" vote. It's a tad long (the brief sub-plot with The Scarecrow could have been easily axed, for instance), though not unbearably so. Eckhart's Two-Face make-up is impeccable but just too over-the-top for me to accept; how does an eyeball even survive the burns that ruined his face so dramatically? Additionally, the usual action movie defiance of physics and human physiology belies Nolan's attempt to otherwise ground his story in reality. There are questions of how The Joker can reasonably set-up such elaborate traps, let alone manage to successfully hire the legion of goons who so willingly carry out his homicidal, and all too often back-stabbing, plans.Still, these are relatively minor flaws in an otherwise fully-realized and complex tale of conflicted good versus unmitigated evil. The parallels drawn to current difficulties with international terrorism are quite evident, both thematically and visually. The answers provided to difficult ethical dilemmas are appropriately incomplete; there is no cheap closure provided for the Batman's angst, nor easy answers to Joker's psychosis. The Nolans have elevated run-of-the-mill comic book pop psychology much closer to rarefied levels of myth and legend. If another episode of the revitalized Batman franchise gets green-lighted, the challenge of topping this entry will be extraordinary. I, for one, will look forward to it.""The Dark Knight"" may have a limited appeal to an older demographic (current IMDb voting shows the 45+ cohort more than a full point beneath the weighted average), but the quality of film-making should draw a lot of these folks in when the DVD is released. I'm also amused that a full three percent of IMDb voters tagged this with a ""1"". Are they blind, willfully stupid, or just paid confederates of Joker? ""The Dark Knight"" is an adrenaline-fueled rocket of a movie that manages to avoid catering to LCD sensibilities and leaves its audience with plenty to think and talk about, more so than any other superhero movie so far, and if nothing else, will stand as permanent testament to the acting chops of Heath Ledger. For that alone, it's worth seeing.(Very slightly edited 8.05.08 after second viewing)"
7480,True,"The Dark Knight is the one film ever to be hyped up by everyone with a brain in their head, and then still exceed my expectations. With everyone on planet Earth hyping it up to the extreme, I was thinking that it could never be as good as people said it was. I was right, it was even better than that.Heath Ledger plays an amazing Joker. Unlike Jack Nicholson's 1989 terrible performance, the Joker as played by Ledger doesn't go out of it's way to be funny. It just is, the way he does some of his lines, he comes off as funny-yet morbid, exactly how the Joker should be played. It was almost as if they just took the comic book character, changed the way he looks slightly, and slapped him on screen. He plays the Joker that perfect.Aaron Eckhart plays an incredible Harvey Dent/Two Face as well. Again, it's almost as if they took the best comic adaptation and slapped it on screen. Eckhart was better as Two Face than some comic adaptations. Some of the comics go way out of their way to portray him as troubled and struggling with himself, and it ends up interfering with how terrifying of a villain he is. Not the case with Eckhart. He plays a perfect balance of troubled Harvey Dent and murderous vengeful Two Face after the explosion. And the way he looks is incredible. After campy purple-faced Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever, I wasn't expecting much for Two Face's look. Wow, did it shock me when he first turned toward the camera. His face was a total train wreck. So gruesome, yet it was impossible to turn away. Very incredible.With all the buzz about the incredible villains in this film, people tend to ignore the goddamn Batman. Christian Bale delivers yet another incredible performance as Gotham's protector. This time, already established as Batman, he struggles with keeping the identity versus saving innocents. This creates quite a conflict for him, as he even considers giving up on being Batman at one point. Very well played, but sorry Bale, your performance didn't seem as direct out of the comics as your adversaries. He played an amazing Batman, incredible performance, but it didn't strike me as quite as good of a performance as Ledger and Eckhart's. Even Gary Oldman's Commissioner Gordon seemed direct out of the Batman:Year One series. Bale seemed to be the only actor that wasn't direct out of the comics. I can't explain why, exactly, but if you've read a significant number of Batman comics and you see this film, I'm sure you'll agree.All in all, incredible. I went in expecting a lot, and went out beyond satisfied. The first thing I wanted to do upon leaving the IMAX theater was buy a ticket to get back into it. Completely mind-blowing movie from beginning to end. The first movie experience I've ever had where I felt like all the hype was telling the truth."
7481,True,"I have watched every batman movie ever but this one was more than a movie it was a masterpiece...this movie took my breathe away i was sat on the edge of my seat throughout the movie the joker was brilliant from his makeup to his madness heath ledger was the perfect actor and man did he look crazy.his creepy voice and his awful stringy hair with a tint of green made the joker look that little more evil. Nolan is a modern day Einstein... but smarter. his recreation of batman was amazing his smart cool day life and his dark knight change over his voice is low and creepy at knight whereas its smooth and cool in the day he is the perfect actor. Batman's cars are always extreme but this time he has a tank a big ass bike and a Lamborghini i mean come on how cool is that!!Every part of the movie was perfect i can think of only one bad thing about the movie it was too short and Batman's ears didn't suit him. it has been left open for another movie so i am expecting it to be just as good . Harvey dent is a convincing evil person even when he was supposed to be the ""white knight"" i thought he was evil. from the extreme stunts and graphics to the brilliant directing this movie was perfect."
7482,True,"Forget Spider-Man or Iron Man, the best superhero movie of this decade doesn't even have the word 'man' it it. The Dark Knight doesn't just provide a title for this movie, it encapsulates the entire mood of the film. 'Dark'? 'Moody'? These words only begin to to summarise what the overall atmosphere when watching this film is. You can add 'depressing' and 'morbid' to the list. It had been stated previously that the theme for this movie was ""things having to get worse before they get better"" (a character even utters as much in the film) - and that's exactly what we are presented with. The story has grown, gotten more complex and matured even further than the already mature-themed Batman Begins. As the themes get darker, so do the characters, and the actors who portray them all bring their A game.He may be sporting a ""improved"" Bat-suit, riding atop a new vehicle called the 'Batpod', but Christian Bale continues to cement his reputation as the best Bruce Wayne/Batman there's ever been. He plays both characters exceedingly well. None of the previous actors who've portrayed the dual roles have seemed to be able to balance between both characters. Bale succeeds where they failed, and makes for an extremely intimidating Batman (who you can understand strikes fear into the hearts of civilians and criminals alike), whilst at the same time managing to keep Bruce Wayne very human and sympathetic. If there's one negative comment to be made about Bruce/Batman in this film, it's that both their characters are not explored nearly as much this time around as they were in the first film.They say a film is only as good as its villain, and with Heath Ledger, Christopher Nolan has found the perfect ""fearless"" actor to properly realise such a psychopathic character as the Joker. Yes, believe all the hype, believe what the other people involved in the film have said. It's 100% true. The Joker promises to give us a ""better class of criminal"", and - boy howdy - does he EVER. This is one performance that will in NO WAY disappoint. Where Jack Nicholson played a laughable clown character, Ledger's Joker is something truly terrifying and magnificent to behold. NOT ONCE does he cross the line into ""over-the-top"", but instead keeps the villain grounded in reality (albeit, a heightened reality). It's for this reason that Ledger's Joker exceeds expectations. His sense of humour is extremely morbid and sick, he never offers a clear origin as to how he became who/what he is, and he keeps you at the edge of your seat every time he appears on screen. His streaked make-up, his maniacal voice, even his WALK all contribute to making this a performance that'll go down in history as one of THE BEST performances of a screen villain to date. Ledger, who obviously had plenty of talent to burn, brings this film to a whole new level. His final completed performance is bittersweet and displays just how much he had going for him.Taking over from Katie Holmes (in the role of Bruce's childhood sweetheart, Rachel Dawes) is Maggie Gyllenhaal...and I couldn't have been happier. She's a VAST improvement on the previous actress who portrayed the role, and it's befuddling as to why Gyllenhaal wasn't cast originally. Everything that was wrong about the way Holmes played the character is corrected this time around. It then comes as a major disappointment to discover that this is the only time we'll get to see such a layered performance of what is - essentially - a pretty thankless role. In a limited amount of screen time, Gyllenhaal manages to make up for what was lacking in the character all throughout the last movie. It's sad that such a talented actress was severely underused and written out far too early in this film. The characters' reactions to her demise (most important among them being Bruce's) feel empty and are pretty lacking, I'm sad to say. In some respects, it was such a waste (bringing in a far superior actress to fix what a lesser actress had done with the part, only to get rid of the actress who manages to salvage the role within this film).As the Harvey Dent, Aaron Eckhart shows what an outstanding performance he is capable of giving. He plays a likable guy, doing what Batman's trying to do, but going about it in a different manner (one that keeps to the law). While he and Bruce are the two most important men in Rachel's life (and, in a certain respect, are rivals when it comes to this woman who they both love), it never degenerates into a clichéd love triangle. Bruce/Batman respects Harvey (""Gotham's White Knight"" as he's referred to as) and, above all else, he wants to maintain Harvey's beliefs and preserve what they both stand for. This adds many more layers to what could have been a forgettable role. Though, towards the end of the movie, the last thing you'll be doing is forgetting the tragic Harvey Dent, as he is transformed into the twisted split personality of Two-Face. Just as Heath Ledger has eclipsed all previous incarnations of the Joker, Eckhart puts Tommy Lee Jones' laughable performance as Two-Face (in Batman Forever) to shame. This time around, Two-Face is every bit as menacing and unpredictable as he should have always been. The scarred half of his face is truly horrifying and will indeed sicken everyone (except the idiot sitting behind me, who snickered whenever the grotesque visage was shown).Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman have not been forgotten. They reprise their roles as Alfred, Lt. Gordon and Lucius Fox, and are given a decent amount of screen time to develop their characters fully (Gary Oldman, especially, is a standout).Summing up, this movie is everything a sequel should be...and then some."
7483,True,"The best performances are those that are understated. And the best scripts are those that do not beat you over the head with some idea or point. Their greatness lies in the fact that the viewer must totally immerse him or herself in the story and the characters and are left to draw many of their own conclusions.Whether you believe Heath Ledger is worthy of an Oscar or not, there is no denying the brilliance of his performance. In fact, all of the actors have turned in brilliant performances that stay within the realm of subtle brilliance. We will turn to the Joker in just a moment.As with the on screen performances, the performance of the script wirters, editor, director, and all those who led technical brilliance to this film are of equal quality. The script is haunting and allows the actors to explore the depths of their characters fully.*** Spoiler Alert ***However, the performance of the Joker character, as portrayed by Heath Ledger, is one of the most maniacly creepy evil performances to come to the screen in a very long time. And the true genius of the performance is that he does not resort to over-the-top tactics to accurately portray the villainous nature of the character. It is actually quite the opposite. It is the subtle, controlled, almost calm nature of the performance that makes the character seem over-the-top.The beauty of the Joker is that his character not only portrays evil in its truest sense, without guilt, without remorse, and without concern for anything but the evil acts. What adds an extra dimension to the 'Dark Knight' Joker is that he is able to bring out those characteristics in others by manipulating fear, anger, and remorse of the poor citizens of Gotham.And the beauty of the story is that no only the week and average are succeptable to the manipulations of the Joker, but the very best people of Gotham (including our caped hero) can fall victim to the evil Joker.While the movie is indeed 'Dark', and does have many dark overtones, in the end good triumphs over evil as the citiznes of Gotham show that they will not be manipulated by Joker and will overcome his evil nature.This movie is disturbing as it exposes the weaknesses of indiviual men, and man in general. It demonstrates how those in power can use fear and other equally twisted mehtods to control people. And also how those who are truly good, can be perceived as evil in while they serve to protect us.*** End Spoiler Alert ***The Dark Knight is truly fantastic. It surpasses the original film as it takes a completely different direction and tone. This movie delivers near perfect performances, a high quality script, and superb technical value. It delivers on every level throughout the running time. It is one of those movies that you can not turn away from, even if you find the content disturbing."
7484,True,"Let's cut to the chase..The Dark Knight was everything I had hoped it to be and so0o0o0o0o much more.What can I say that hasn't already been said a MILLION times over? Heath Ledgers Joker is Breathtaking.... this performance will haunt my dreams for nights to come. Legendary. He took this role, and RAN with it, dancing over ANY other actor to play the character before him. Grim, funny, disturbing, depraved, vicious, psychotic... He captured The Joker's scarred psyche to perfection.This isn't Heath Ledger in this movie folks.... no no no... This is THE JOKER.He will captivate you completely, and pull you into his demented mind, whether you wanna go there or not.The movie pays homage to some of the greatest comics/graphic novels, and these bits are completely obvious (and f*ucking awesome) to fans of the comics. The Long Halloween, Batman Year One, and The Killing Joke just to name a few.Harvey Dent's tragic fate is both emotional, and disturbing.... FINALLY this great character has been done justice on screen.I was worried Aaron Eckhart couldn't pull off such a complex character, but, after seeing the movie, I don't think they could've got a better man for the job... He's so likable in the role, that it makes his transformation into a monster all the more tragic and disheartening.I'm surprised they got away with a PG-13 rating with how frighteningly savage Two-Face looks. (you can see his bulging eyeball and bone underneath all that burnt mangled flesh) The overall story arc for Harvey Dent/Two-Face was extraordinarily well done.TDK is one of the most intense, gripping, WILD movies I've ever seen on the big screen.... you'll feel exhausted and DAZED both physically and mentally by the time ya walk out of the theater, because of the overload of senses from everything you've just witnessed. The intensity starts at 100% and NEVER dies down...This is a smart, thought provoking movie, made by one of the most intelligent, talented, visionary directors of this generation.The Dark Knight is one of the most memorable movies I've seen in a very long time....It sticks with you... at least, for me... looking back, it almost feels like a dream.. like.. I didn't even see the movie.. just vague, dark images in the back of my mind...Even if you're not much of a fan of the Bat, you NEED to see this movie.You'd be doing yourself a great disservice if ya don't go see this flick.Now... I have to see it again. But next time, here's hoping it'll be in all it's IMAX splendor.3 years waiting for this movie... 3 years hyping, and anticipating this movie... it's good to know it wasn't all in vain. As far as comic movies go, this is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.Well worth the wait, clowns. Believe the hype."
7485,True,"After months of an INCREDIBLE ad campaign (including whysoserious.com, ibeliveinharveydent.com, ibelieveinharveydenttoo.com and gothampizzaria.com among others) I didn't believe this film could live up to the hype I'd created for it, as with so many films before it. Two people I know saw the film before me, and their descriptions of ""much darker"" and ""really really good movie"" just didn't even come close to preparing me for what this film was going to be. This has to be THE darkest film I have ever seen in my life. No question in my mind that the PG13 / 12 rating is absurd. This film lies firmly in the 15 category for me. I don't think we ever actually see blood shed on screen, but simply the psychological tone of the film is so mature, dark, and realistic (to use the term loosely). I came out of the IMAX completely emotionally drained, an incredible film to say the least. I will not re-type everything said in the above comments, but I agree to that wholeheartedly, action, writing, direction, acting, casting all 100% top-notch. *MINOR SPOILERS* I did not expect to see Twoface in this film, simply the glimpse we caught in the trailer (in much the same vain as we see Vader in SWE3). The only part of the film I could have done without was the sonar eyes thing at the end. Abit too much, having said that I liked the aeroplane though so it's all part of it I guess. I saw a review saying that the end of the film spends too long setting up the sequel, I have to say I disagree with this comment, and think that the pacing was superb, and the 'set up' for the sequel was far more subtle than BB. I came out of the theatre fully expecting it to be night, and for two or three large buildings to have been demolished/blown up whilst I'd been in there. It took me a good hour to fully re-adjust to the real world again. The film sets it up perfectly for the Joker to carry on and become who he truly should be: Batman's arch- Nemesis, however as i realised at the end of my hour, that now can't happen because as I suddenly remembered, the Joker wasn't real, he was after all only and actor (although the term 'only' does not do the performance justice) and of course, that actor has now passed away.An incredible film to be sure though."
7486,True,"In a summer of comic book movies, deciding which one was the best is a hard task. So far we have been treated to film adaptations of Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk and a Hellboy sequel, all of which were very good. The Dark Knight makes the decision even harder.Christopher Nolan's sequel to the already excellent Batman Begins is better than the original, better than all four Burton/Schumaker films combined, and better than other comic book films such as every Superman movie ever made. Christian Bale returns as the Caped Crusader, reprising the role that made him a star. Bale once again blows us all away as he makes Michael Keaton look like George Clooney in the Batsuit. However, there is a reason the word ""Batman"" is not in the title: This movie belongs to not Batman, but the Joker. The late Heath Ledger makes his presence felt in his final film. Compared to Ledger's Joker, Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the Clown Prince of Crime in Tim Burton's 1989 version of Batman is the equivalent of the disaster that was Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze in Batman and Robin.The film picks up a few months after ""Begins"". Gotham City (a thinly disguised Chicago) is becoming safer thanks to the efforts of Batman, good cop Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and new Gotham DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). The real Batman, Bruce Wayne, is facing some problems in social life, much like Peter Parker in Spider Man 2. Dent is currently dating Bruce's childhood sweetheart Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllhanall who replaces Katie Holmes). Gotham is suddenly threatened by The Joker, a sadistic killer who wears clown makeup and gets a kick out of torture. When Nicholson did the role, he went for laughs. Ledger does the same. The only difference is when Jack tried to be funny, he did silly things like point a gun with an outrageously long barrel. When Heath tries to be funny he does magic. He makes a pencil disappear! Wanna know how he does it, kids? He puts the pencil on the table, then throws a guy head-on into the pencil! Sir Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman reprise their respective roles as Alfred and Lucius Fox. Both are a couple of the greatest actors we have ever seen, and are not afraid to demonstrate. They both are the voice of reason in Bruce Wayne's crazy brain, and crack out the funny one liners to lighten the mood of this dark film.Speaking of the film's darkness, it's not a great idea to bring the kiddies to this one. This is darker than all of the previous five and even some adults may be affected by Ledger's death when viewing this film. It's impossible not to think of Heath's passing when he is on screen, and some images seem a bit disturbing due to his death. For example, there is one scene where The Joker hides in a body bag to avoid some rival gangsters.Ledger, once again, makes this film. Fans, like myself, will love his memorable quotes such as ""Why so SERIOUS?"" or ""Let's put a smile on that face!"". However, sometimes Ledger makes his presence felt by not saying a word at all. For example, a scene where The Joker, dressed in as a nurse, blows up a hospital, is made funny in a sick way. Heath simply walks through the crumbling building as explosions go off behind him. After a while they stop. Ledger, makes a few funny faces, messes around with a controller, then casually walks away as the building explodes.Ledger couldn't have done it without a little help, though. Oldman's Gordon is given a much bigger role in the film, much to the viewer's delight. While everybody loved Oldman is ""Begins"", ""TDK"" establishes Gordon as the greatest hero in Gotham not named Batman. Eckhart is great as Dent, and even better as the villainous Two-Face, who Dent becomes when his face is horribly scarred by The Joker. Eckhart makes fans forget about Batman Forever, where Tommy Lee Jones completely butchered the part.Sadly, though, the film is not without its few flaws. Gyllanhall has no chemistry on screen with anyone, not even Bale. Katie Holmes is, surprisingly, missed. Caine is very good, but his role is made smaller in this film. And finally, one of the things that made ""Begins"" so good was Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow. Sadly, Scarecrow makes only a quick appearance that has almost nothing to do with the plot. He is, however, spared, leaving Scarecrow fans, like myself, hopeful.Overall, The Dark Knight makes us love the comic book film even more. It also gives us a tragic reminder...we are Definitely going to miss Heath Ledger."
7487,True,"""The Dark Knight"" has got to be the darkest and most mature superhero movie to come to the big screen so far, tackling morality in such uncompromising manner that is at times haunting and often painful. With the burden of the obligatory backstory done with, director Christopher Nolan, and co-writer and brother Jonathan Nolan have more freedom to paint a larger picture of Batman (Christian Bale) and in the process, crafting a masterpiece; and I'm not one to use that word lightly here, as the film provides moviegoers with their share of summer escapism coupled with tragic foundations dealing with morality, heroism, sanity, and power.Since the end of the first installment, ""Batman Begins"", the Caped Crusader has now risen to legendary status among the citizens of Gotham City, even spawning wannabe vigilantes in Batman costumes. But it's a case of love and hate for the hero as some people view Batman's acts as anything but heroic, including the members of several organized crime syndicates who are slowly but surely feeling the effects of Batman being around to clean up their acts. Add Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Gotham City's new D.A., who decides to fight these criminals, together with police lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and it seems all is going well with Gotham City. That is, until a crazed sadist named Joker (Heath Ledger) comes and brings chaos to town. His only demand is for Batman to reveal his true identity or a life will be taken every time Batman doesn't.This version of Batman is in many ways superior and more brooding than Tim Burton's version, which for a while, became the definitive big screen adaptation of the Caped Crusader. Here, Batman is as vulnerable as anyone and the darkness permeates everywhere, from the setting to the characters themselves. Bale, who reprises his role as Batman and his billionaire alter-ego Bruce Wayne, owns the role, adding a certain level of depth to what could have been yet another standard comic book superhero by providing a believable aspect of Batman's fallibility.Maggie Gyllenhaal, replacing Katie Holmes (arguably the weakest link in the first film), brings more intelligence to the role of Rachel Dawes, Bruce Wayne's former flame. Actually, everyone in the supporting cast does well, especially Eckhart who brings charisma to his role as Harvey Dent who starts out as a character full of hope and it's hard not to care for him even as he eventually descends into tragic madness.Of course, no review of this film will ever be complete without mentioning the Joker, as played by the late Heath Ledger, both because no Batman series is complete without facing his arch nemesis, and because this has to be Ledger's best acting turn and it's unfortunate it's also his last. His turn as the Joker is a far more intelligent, sinister and twisted, without going over-the-top as did Jack Nicholson in the 1989 installment.Still, anyone who comes in not for all the existential quandaries and gritty drama but simply for the action won't walk away disappointed. Nolan has placed enough adrenaline-pumping fight scenes, car chases, and explosions which mostly rely more on organic camera-work. A couple of scenes during the climax involving choices are done with little traces of predictability it adds up to the overall tension of the film.In a period where comic book superheroes are turning to a more mature route to the big screen, ""The Dark Knight"" presents a multi-faceted thought-provoking superhero tale that accomplishes more than what it's set to do. Coming from a Marvel Comics fan, I have to say that Nolan's version of one of DC Comics' most recognizable characters is by far the best rendition of the genre. Forget about it being one of the better sequels to come out; it's one of the best movies I've seen."
7488,True,"I think it was the opening scene in Dark Knight that really blew my mind. It was reminiscent of a Quentin Tarantino Film, a bank robbery where everyone is ordered to kill everyone. Not for a moment did I expect the clown mask to come off only to reveal Heath Ledger. From there on in this movie literally held me at the edge of my seat, mesmerized by what would happen next. Every time Ledger took the screen he commanded your attention, whether you chose to give it to him or not he had your focus. He was truly the greatest batman villain ever portrayed on screen. Ledger took the joker and made him charismatic, seedy, and terrifying. Never before have I seen Christian Bale get out-acted in a film, but Heath knew what he was doing. Everyone did on this film. Nolan made every scene as intense as the next, Christian Bale made Batman into not a superhero, but a man, something the character had been missing before. I mean, there is almost no way they could have made this movie better. From the intense special effects that used almost no CGI and still blew me away to the gripping storyline or the multitude of villains and realistic feel of Gotham City and all it's surroundings, I felt like a gothamite just watching the events unfold. Not only will I say this is the best movie of 2008, but probably the best comic book movie of all time."
7489,True,"***MILD SPOILERS***** What a fantastic film. Let's start by saying, this isn't the Batman from the TV series, and it isn't even quite the Tim Burton Batman from the 80s/90s. Burton created a dark, dreary world, creepy, somewhat real and somewhat surreal.Instead, what we have here is Batman existing in 2008, with cell phones, globalization, terrorism - things that are all too real. This movie feels like it could happen in Chicago or New York or Los Angeles, not some fictional place like Gotham City. That's makes for at least a portion of the freakiness.But the most freaky thing in this film, bar none, is Heath Ledger as the Joker. NEVER have I seen a villain that nuanced, that detailed, that meticulously crafted. Was it the screenplay, or was it Ledger's acting, or was it the synergy of those 2 things combined? Whatever brought it out, Heath Ledger's Joker was beyond creepy. They didn't waste any effort on his back-story, like Burton did with Nicholson's character (who was a pretty solid Joker, but nothing like THIS). There were moments where I felt that the Joker was a sympathetic figure, only to realize 45 minutes later that I had been duped. I can't say anymore without some serious spoilers, and I have no desire to ruin this movie for anyone. I am certain that Ledger will get a posthumous Oscar for his performance. I almost cried when I got home, over the tragedy that the guy didn't live to hear the raves about his phenomenal portrayal. His death was sad already, but his Joker was simultaneously a thespian triumph and tragedy.I wasn't super-impressed by Bale, but I guess that's the new Batman. He's still very misunderstood, even by those closest to him. At points, it seems he doesn't even seem to understand himself, who he is, and what he should be doing. Maybe like the rest of us. Not a cocksure hero like we see in other Batmans, but a guy who strives to do the right thing, yet doubting his own actions. And he takes things too far - truly a flawed character in many ways. Maybe that's what makes this a great movie. I will say this - if you're expecting 2 hours of screen time for Bale, forget it. He gets less time than Harvey Dent or Commissioner Gordon.Eckhardt as Dent is really good. A wonderful, nuanced performance. Likable, yet cocky. I thought his ""transformation"" seemed a shade rushed, and the fact that his villainy is limited to pretty much one event is unfortunate. I was hoping that he would have been milked for more plot development in the future - his character's story is somewhat compelling, and the part was well-played.While I liked Oldman as Gordon, I couldn't escape thinking ""that mustache is fake"". Still, he looked like a desperate honest cop, which was the role. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine were very good as Bruce's/Batman's ""aides"" (Freeman plays the equivalent of ""Q"" in a Bond film, while Caine is Alfred). Alfred was well written, and isn't just some old ""yes-man"" butler like we've seen him in past Batmans - he's got some conscience, and even (righteously) objects to some of the things the Dark Knight is doing. I liked Maggie G. as Rachel Dawes...VERY adorable. But the surprise role, to me, is Eric Roberts as the crime boss. Genius.What a great film. Even if you don't like the Batman narrative, this film stands on its own, and the acting is superb. Go see it if you haven't, if for nothing else, just to see Ledger's Joker."
7490,True,"When I first caught Batman Begins 3 years back, I was awed by the way the movie was made. I went into the theater for the Dark Knight with high expectations and guess what........ it surpassed my expectations.Great script, great acting and most of all..... great show!! Christian Bale again shows that he was born to play the Batman.Michael Caine is perfect as Alfred Pennyworth.The late Heath Ledger gave an outstanding performance as the Joker. Won't give the plot away for those waiting to catch this but don't expect Ledger to be in the same league as Jack Nicholson. IMHO, I think he is way way ahead of old Jack in this performance. While the Joker in Batman(1989) was more of a clown, this joker is more of a ruthless criminal who plays mind games with the Dark Knight and Gotham Police Force.The search for a Harvey Dent was worth it. AAron Eckhart hits the nail on the coffin with his portrayal of Harvey Dent and his performance of Two-Face. Watching him will make viewers forget Tommy Lee Jones performance in Batman Forever. This Two-Face stays true to his origins. And also, great idea for the origins of Two-Face. At least, no acid being thrown in court.Overall, a show not to be missed. Can't wait for the DVD release."
7491,True,"Heath Ledger's greatest performance is also his last. What a terrible shame. He stole this movie away from the powerhouse Christian Bale - who never shone brighter than he did in Batman Begins - and the tremendous understated Gary Oldman. Aaron Eckhardt is also a great talent and was a surprising treat as Harvey Dent. There was almost nothing wrong with this film.But I think it was too long. At least, I'm pretty sure it was.I honestly thought the show was over when the Joker was apprehended the first time and was very satisfied with that ending. But it was only half way finished.Don't get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with the 2nd half, either. It was good storytelling, deeply thoughtful psychodrama, and filled with amazing action. So, why not make two movies out of it? Then we could have savored the legacy of the late Heath Ledger that much more."
7492,True,"While I write this I'm still immensely impressed with the forcefulness of this film, there are really few action or adventure movies that will create what ""The Dark Knight"" gets in just a few minutes, and that is to bring the climax of emotions with a script that is strengthened in each of its lines and with an edition that frame after frame doesn't exist any wastage. Anything that we had heard about this film before its premiere, all these positive comments that the criticism launched after having seen it, all the positive references are true, very true. To begin with, the action sequences are a visual choreography, in each one's emotions are as much as possible, because not only are loaded by a perfect use of special effects, explosions and an audio editing forceful, but also because Bale, and Heath Ledger above all, build two characters who represent two sides of the coin and their clashes are so catastrophic that makes everything a witness from the edge of the seat. And is that really the performances are at the level of what anyone could expect, but definitely this is the film of The Joker. Either that, including me, thought that no one could deprive the best interpretation of this murderer to Jack Nicholson, really we have our mouths open to the strength, vitality and terror that manages to combine Ledger villain in this, I confess at times was too crazy up to me, and that is what succeeds, it succeeds really that you think that this man is a man without any kind of moral questioning, everything for him is a macabre game. So Joker works well because it also has a dramatic, dark and vertiginous screenplay that unfolds quickly to each of the characters and at the same time, for that speed with which everything happens, forcing the viewer to be attentive to each of the sequences, each of the planes, and the richness of this script is that even if it is full of action is also an ode about a moral antihero, that make you think about the various faces of good and evil, and leads to comic character to a much more psychological level, reflected whenever Joker and Batman exchange lines, and which culminates with a hopeful end even when circumstances suggest quite the opposite and balance between the two sides of the coin has been broken. That's because the script is really something worthwhile, for all Batman, The Joker, Harvey Dent and James Gordon mean and represent. The film is not an idealistic and beautiful portrait of a hero, is a dark film about a man who loads a weight of being a hero that nobody wants, is the battle of a man in front of the chaos, is the fascination of anarchy and violence and hope that lies even after the cataclysm. Yes, it has its errors of continuity, some holes in the plot, but not all opaque this marvelous film. This is a great film in a genre in which there seemed no room for maturity, for the visual beauty that has made the best Batman film."
7493,True,"First let me set the stage so you might better appreciate my perspective. I love movies. It's so easy for me to give 7's and 8's on movies. Mostly because I simply enjoy watching movies. But I very rarely give out 9's and have never given out a 10. This movie is a 10. I feel as if I need to downgrade past reviews as a result. lol I went into this movie with some doubts. First I am a HUGE Jack Nicholson fan and was hoping nobody would ruin what I felt was a great last impression of the Joker (played by Mr. Nicholson). I didn't have faith in Ledger's performance either. Can't say I'm a fan of his. Not that I don't dislike him either but most of the movies he made I never really paid much attention to. Could care less about his Brokeback performance and felt he was becoming just another star they wanted to cram down our throats.Dark Knight is AWESOME!! I completely loved Heath Ledger's performance. I felt he stole the show. He left no stone unturned. Makes the actor who played Scarecrow (from the first movie) look like a fool in my eyes. I was on the edge of my seat the entire film. The writing was brilliant. Writing was a 10!! The veteran actors were superb and added much to the film in their limited roles. I will see Dark Knight again. I will own a copy of this film. There is no doubt in my mind that Ledger's performance in this film would have shot him straight to the top of the charts, even higher than before. Thank you for your brilliant performance."
7494,True,"No other superhero movie have i seen is better than this...i came out of theaters scoffing at the Hancock posters. The Dark Knight surpassed all hopes i had for this movie. At first i was questioning if it would be better than Batman Begins. It outdid it in every aspect. Christian Bale is the best batman anyone could ever ask for. Maggie Gyllenhaal was a better choice for the role of Rachel Dawes. I personally am not a big Katie Holms fan. Though she did very well in Batman Begins i feel Gyllenhaal was a better selection for the role. Aaron Eckhart was everything you could ask for in Harvey Dent(surpassed Billy Dee William's role as dent in the '89 film) And the transformation between Dent to Two-Face began very subtle and maxed out as best it could. I feel it was done very well with the gasoline spilling on his left half of his face and it just catching a spark. He played Two-Face very well way better than Tommy Lee Jones in the old Batman movies that many people will now forget. Eckhart did very well in this role.Heath Ledger...he stole the show! It was going to be tough to replace Jack Nicholson as the Joker in our hearts. Ledger was the best selection for this character. He was so devoted to almost create his own back story for the character. He went back and forth from extreme to extreme to complete this role. Anyone who can watch A Clockwork Orange(1971) daily just to watch Alex to get into character has got to be nuts. And to look to Sid Vicious(who killed his wife or girlfriend) for inspiration. This helped him pull off ""nuts"" better than anyone else could even try to do. His depiction and so chosen persona of the Joker was right on. Ledger did great work on his last full production movie before his tragic death. All in all the best movie of 2008 and best superhero movie ever!"
7495,True,"I have one problem with this movie. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes. She has no conviction, she is annoying, and I felt no sorrow when she died. Her failure to portray Rachel the way Katie Holmes made her in Batman Begins as wholesome and dedicated makes it hard to relate to Harvey Dent's grief. In this movie she is entirely different, seemingly only there because the plot requires it, she brings nothing to the movie. With that being said, that is one very little flaw in a fantastic movie. The sonar cell phone was a little strange, but I'll take it. I mean, Batman always has cool toys.What really makes this movie great is the way it can make you feel twisted. Ledger as the Joker is marvelous. He says that he has no plans, money is meaningless, it's all about the message. He's trying to send the message that we are all a little corrupt, we're all a little off, and we just need to be pushed. The human mind is a fragile thing. As dark as this movie is you are frequently laughing. The Joker takes a man's life with a joke, the disappearing pencil, sick and disgusting, yet everyone is laughing. Every scene with Ledger leaves you laughing and feeling as if you are the most terribly gruesome person. Why are you laughing, he's murdering people. We are corrupt. That is what he believes, and that's what he shows you. It's sick.Aside from the violence and mind twist you have the struggling hero. Or heroes. Batman fighting crime along side Harvey Dent. In the end Dent is corrupted, Batman is not. Batman is the hero that Gotham needs him to be. The greatness of this movie has little to do with Batman, but what he stands for against a world of corruption. He stands as the man who is willing to be loved or hated to see his city fight back. I will say no more, you must see this movie.It is likely that I will never love another movie more."
7496,True,"I just returned home from seeing the 12:01 AM showing of The Dark Knight. If any of you insomniacs are up at this hour, I want you to get in your car and drive to the nearest movie theater. Yes, at 4 AM. This film was an absolute masterpiece of a comic book superhero movie. A brilliant score, which, if I am not mistaken, ran throughout the duration of the movie. The only problem I had with this movie is that when Katie Holmes turned down her return in the Dark Knight, the casting directors had a chance to replace her with someone Christian Bale had more chemistry with, and they replaced her with Maggie Gyllenhaal (although a great actress, completely wrong for this role). In my opinion both actresses delivered unconvincing performances in their respective movies. But no matter. I give this movie 9 3/4 stars, due to trifles such as that. Nolan did a fantastic job conveying his intricate vision of this chapter in the life of this timeless antihero. I would like to commend him for his incredible work.Heath Ledger trumps Jack Nicholson as the Joker, delivering what was arguably his best performance ever. He without question went out with a bang. An absolute artist, the perverse nature of his masterpiece of a penultimate performance will force all to shudder at such an untimely death for such a talented man. A masterful performance, mind games, and plenty of big explosions await you. I think ten bucks is a shame."
7497,True,"Amazing. Usually when a movie is hyped this much it's a bad omen. We all knew, following the tragic and untimely passing of Heath Ledger, that the buzz around this film would spiral beyond control... but I was pleasantly surprised (well, maybe not too surprised) to find that the movie actually surpassed the hype. I went into the preview expecting a great movie, but got even more than that. The opening sequence grabs you, the pace of the action keeps you moving along (even for such a long movie), there's just enough (dark) humor mixed in to make the issues the characters face palatable and to make the characters more believable as human. I have just one very minor beef with this film- totally unrelated to plot or characters. Gotham, though fictional, has long been associated with a particular American city. I was kinda bummed to see the movie filmed in that Second city. Oh well. Still a great movie. I just watched in twice in a row, but just couldn't stay through a third screening. Not that it's not worth it- I will definitely see it again, but it's kinda long and I'm reeaallly tired, so, off the bed. I'm sure you will love this film."
7498,True,"I have looked forward to this movie for about a year, and with it being my most anticipated movie ever, i was expecting a roller coaster ride of emotion, chaos and anarchy... I got it all and more.Heath Ledger's performance is nothing short of brilliant. When he's on screen, hes amazing, and when he's off screen, you want him back. Thats how good he is in the film. I did however, think they could have had The Joker in the film a bit more.Christian Bale is very good as Batman, but tries a bit too hard on the Bruce Wayne character. Maggie gyllenhaul is better than Katie Holmes period, although she wasn't as involved in the crime fighting as Katie Holmes' was.Aaron Eckhart was a perfect choice for Harvey Dent, and you could tell throughout the film that he had a dark side, especially when he had a few angry outbursts at Gordon and Batman.In conclusion, I've never seen a film travel so fast, considering its a 2.5 hour movie. It fells like 1.5 hours!! It is very well written with many memorable quotes..The highlights for me in the film were: The Joker's meeting with the mob bosses, and for that split second when Gamble calls him crazy - Joker's reply is priceless!! The Bat Pod chase to the Joker was amazing, along with the hospital scene with a bit of dark comedy..Ledger carried this film, and without him, i wouldn't have the satisfaction i have now for this great film, SEE THIS FILM NOW!!"
7499,True,"Shot well but with a plot so full of holes it was hard to enjoy it and not get annoyed. How exactly DID the joker manage to fill buildings and passenger ferries up with drums of diesel and explosives without anyone knowing?? AND why did Bruce Wayne's voice change every time he put on the Bat Suit?? etc etc Very annoying. (Although it seems as if I'm the only one who didn;t enjoy it!!) When they smashed the Batman search light with an axe WHY did they have it plugged in and switched on???) Joker escapes from custody too many times and after a while it just gets irritating. The movie is also too long and each time you think the story is coming to a conclusion it goes off on another tack... you've guessed, the Joker escapes and starts on another mission of pointless mayhem."
7500,True,"I would watch it 24/7 everyday all day forever, Ledger's performance is monumental, but The Dark Knight lives up to it. Nolan cements his position as Hollywood's premier purveyor of blockbuster smarts  and the Batbike is kinda cool, too.You may have to fight yourself out. But a movie this potent and provocative is well worth the battle,This sequel to 'Batman Begins' is mesmerizing and thought-provoking. But it shouldn't have been named after the good guy. This is the Joker's court, and he's not looking for a laugh.The Dark Knight is bound to haunt you long after you've told yourself, Aah, it's only a comic-book movie."
7501,True,"This is easily gonna go down as one of if not the best superhero movies of all time. I saw this after watching the 3rd mummy movie, and I gotta say, it really made that night better than what it was turning out to be. My dad and I just decided to see another movie after the mummy, since we had nothing better to do and the last one left a bad aftertaste. I was blown away at first. It was the first time I'd ever seen such a mature rendition of a superhero. I was very excited to see my favourite batman villain, finally portrayed well, as his last appearance was in Batman Forever. Needless to say I was disappointed with that one. That villain by the way, is Two-Face. Speaking of villains, wow, Heath Ledger as the Joker was amazing. His performance was twisted, frightening, and also downright fun. Anyways, Great film, and a terrific instalment in the Batman franchise."
7502,True,"Seriously, This was one of the greatest films I have ever seen. Plain and simple. Im not saying it did not have some silly stupid stuff in it that I could have done without, but overall what a movie! Ledger's Joker will never be topped. Every scene in the movie that did not have Joker in it, I was sitting there going ""whens the joker coming back"". I just simply could not get enough of the character. He was so deep and so true to form. I could not have asked for anything more from Ledgers performance. I would have rathered the movie have been rated R and seen a little more gore, because I think thats the only thing the Joker was not able to display was his cruelty. But still a fantastic performance. Oscar worthy? I don't know, but its got to be the closest any Comic book performance has gotten to being Oscar worthy. Most of my guesses at the plot line were right on. Bale can over act a bit at times. But none of it matters. Ledger steals the movie and everything else takes a back seat to his performance."
7503,True,"I have never liked batman as a character... Old movies were OK but not that good... Until Christian Bale came... This movie is the reason why Batman is one of my favorite characters ever... The plot, the direction, the acting... Heath Ledger (RIP) is amazing... An excellent movie indeed!!!The movies that follow are better and better...The way the movie trilogy shows the development of characters is amazing... I was astonished when at the end of The Dark Knight Rises how Robin is born... Who is Catwoman, Two-Faces and others... I am planning to watch Gotham - the Series now because of this movie...Thank you everyone for making Batman the coolest character ever!!!"
7504,True,"This movie has a great plot and good acting, the characters are fantastic and the action sequences are impressive. Subtle plot points may be missed easily, so you have to watch the movie again to get the full plot. However, realism is another story; although the makers intended to make a movie as realistic as possible, they compromised many elements for the sake of making a good movie. The following lines are my rant about realism.The Joker presumably uses only gasoline because it is cheap. Well how about tracking gasoline distribution and theft to catch him instead of making the complicated act we saw in the movie? That would have reduced the movie to five minutes.How comes every floor of a hospital was rigged with gasoline in minutes with nobody noticing?How comes two ferries were rigged with gasoline in their machine rooms with nobody noticing? Don't they undergo regular cleaning and maintenance?How comes Gordon knew the origin of the shots to the Mayor beforehand so he and the Police Dept. could fake his death?How comes a mob bank has access from the roof with no security at all?How comes a school bus can get into a bank and then get out with no scratches, with no other drivers or the police noticing?How comes a military vehicle originally designed to build bridges has an emergency exit in the form of a motorcycle? Why not just using a common motorcycle, some guns and a harpoon, or continue using the tumbler all along?How about having Batman shoot the Joker's truck, or get into it long earlier in the movie?Batman has a rule: he does not kill. So did Batman really need to crash into a mall or a cinema to reach the Joker's truck? How about all the cars he blew up to make way? He did not seem to care about people getting killed in these scenarios; he did not even try to save Harvey's life but probably this one was not an option.What's realistic about all the tricks Batman does in his motorcycle? I would be worried about his cape getting entangled in the wheels.How comes the security for the mob is so tight, but the Joker walks into one of their meetings with such grace, ease, and with explosives?It seems the mob had to hire the Joker to find Lao and protect their bank money, and then at least the Chechen paid him his half to kill Batman. It seems the Joker did the Lao job for free.Here is a weak plot point, more of a coincidence: Melvin White, living in a place over the parade venue, is the same guy that prepared the ammunition for the shooting the previous night, or at least one of the four possible fingerprint matches; and that very place was used to hold the hostage policemen. It was a big plot compromise although the result was very good in terms of suspense."
7505,True,"This movie is great! Batman is awesome! Heath ledger is awesome! Its awesome! If you like Batman, You'll love it! But there's only 1 problem: Why did Rachel die? That was a stupid move. But, besides that, its awesome. So see it! Buy it, Rent it,Before your dying day, See it. On demand, or where ever. Just see it for Pete's sake! I beg you! No, but for real, see it. Batmans awesome! Want to know what would be cool? Freddy vs Batman! That would be cool. Movies to be reviewed: New nightmare,Freddy vs Jason,I already reviewed the other elm street movies,so check em out.Joe"
7506,True,"This a awesome movie, and ""Heath Leadger's"" performance, was nothing more, than legendary. But still the movie, is a little bit overrated, i mean, it's on IMDb'S all time top 20. Come on! Anyways, i really enjoyed it, and can with confident, say that this is the best Batman movie, ever made. And is more darker, and deeper, than the best once. The movie, is about the Joker (Heath Leadger), who's terrorising, Gotham City, And it's basically Bruce Wayne's job, to capture him. And Harvey Dent, who want's to make the city, crime free. Still it deserves a solid place on the top 250, but not in the top 20. Really good movie."
7507,True,"The Dark Knight transcended the superhero genre when it hit the screens and with the present state of the world drowning in terrorism, it put things in to perspective. The impressive cast that brought this moralistic motion picture to life are to be thanked equally and the crew, just as much. The most unusual of artists when put together to play the characters in a comic book movie strangely worked better than expected. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox and Michael Caine as Alfred the Butler, Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne and his alter ego; and most astonishingly of all, Heath Ledger as the criminal psychopath, the Joker were all brilliant in their respective roles. The Dark Knight delivered a powerful message in its story and that was that the real enemy of the people in this generation is chaos. The Joker, an agent of chaos, was the ultimate embodiment of evil. He showed the world that their attempts to control things are incredibly feeble and stupid and threw the city in to a state of panic. Keeping the present state of affairs in mind the film is absolutely truthful in saying this. What makes this film extremely memorable is its last scene where Batman sacrifices his own image to wash off the sins of Harvey Dent and to keep hope intact in the citizens of Gotham. It is heart rendering to see him take matters in to his own hands and jumping in to what could mean his death and eternal excommunication from Gotham. But, in the end, it is for the greater good as he says ""sometimes the truth isn't good enough, sometimes people deserve more, sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded."""
7508,True,"Why The Dark Knight sucks:It is basically akin to Triumph of the Will; pure propaganda. Batman = George W. Bush (or any shady, uber-rich government official). As Bruce Wayne, he must portray himself as a spoiled, bumbling fool, who boozes and womanizes and is just a big walking joke. As Batman, he can use any kind of destructive method to take down the bad guy (in this case, the Joker is often called a terrorist), including using billions of dollars of Wayne Enterprises money to secretly implant 3D-sonar-imaging devices into a wave of new cell phones that flood the market and consequently give him the ability to create a 3D map of the city that can locate and track anyone. His closest friends, who know his secret identity, think this tracking map is unethical, but he justifies it by saying that he must use any means necessary to take this one down. Does any of this sound familiar? Besides all of this, the movie feels like that 15-minute montage of super-heroic feats from every FIRST superhero movie... sssssssssttttttttttrrrrrrrreeeeeeettttttccccchhhhhheeeeedddddd ooooouuuuuutttttt to 2 1/2 hours! It starts out too talky with a bunch of mob bosses (among them Eric Roberts) wriggling out from under D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) in court and throws a few unnecessary story lines up in the air (that don't get resolved until much later... and poorly at that), then strings together action set-pieces (that all seem like leftovers from a Die Hard movie) for the next 2 hours, then finally wraps it up with characteristically cheesy ""the fight will continue"" dialogue that every superhero movie ends with. So it's boring, PLUS it's poorly done apart from that. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
7509,True,The best sequel of Batman from Christoper Nolan.. But.. This movie still doesn't make sense..Why Bruce Wayne (Batman) talking to Fox with Batman Voice when Fox know Bruce is the Batman? Batman can fly from building to building? Is okay.. but if he still alive after fall from that distance only to save Rachel is not REALISTIC and doesn't make sense dude..And how the heck they could make sonar system like that? Make every phone in Gotham City became a something like radar and the batman only need a few second to download and watch in his eyes mask..But i really love The Joker do.. he could make this movie so alive and better.. Joker has lose the fight but he could win my heart or maybe your heart too.. And The Joker is my reason why i give 7 stars for this movie..
7510,True,"Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Morgan Freeman star in this 2008 action sequel. This picks up a short time after the previous film where Bruce Wayne/Batman (Bale) faces a clown criminal, The Joker (Ledger) who starts menacing Gotham City. Bruce meets D.A., Harvey Dent (Eckhart) who is not only engaged to his friend, Rachel Dawes (Gyllenhaal), but tries to help stop the crime until he's disfigured becoming, Harvey Two-Face. Jim Gordon (Oldman) becomes commissioner and Lucius Fox (Freeman) is now Bruce's assistant of Wayne enterprises. Caine also returns as Bruce's butler, Alfred and Eric Roberts appears as mob boss, Salvatore Maroni. This is a good sequel with a good cast & score. Heath was the heart of the film and was brilliant as the Joker. Aaron is also great and I recommend this."
7511,True,"As I usually review every second movie I watch then the last two movies I watched were ''James Bond : Quantum of solace'' and ''The dark knight''. I choosed to review ''The dark knight'' cuz I liked it better. So this movie was veeery good. After this I can surely say that Nolan has saved Batman franchise. I can't even compare this masterpiece to those cheesy Berton movies. Yes, maybe for '90 Bertons Batman series were good. Being honestly even I a bit enjoyed those movies but yet - they were just average for now. And Joker is one of my favorite villains. And in this movie he is ultimate cool with his genial plans and quote: ''Why so serious?''. That was just awesome. and Plot was very cool also.Maybe they could make Harvey Dent to stay alive for next parts if he's not gonna revive in next parts what actually could happen. Afterall this movie was a true masterpiece and I enjoyed likely the whole movie.Now I am waiting for next part ''The dark knight rises'' who will come to screens in 2012."
7512,True,"The Follow up to Batman Begins. But yet The Dark knight created an identity for itself, The Dark Knight Reunites Director Christopher Nolan And Actor Christian Bale, Who Reprises his role of Batman/Bruce Wayne in his almost won war against Crime, Now with the help of Lt. Jim Gordon played by Gary Oldman and District Attorney Harvey Dent played by Aaron Eckhart, Batman set's out to practically destroy Crime in Gotham For good. The idea Proves Effective. But soon All three of Gothams Fighter find themselves prey to a Rising psychotic Criminal Mastermind knows as the Joker Played Flawlessly by Heath Ledger. The Joker Thrust's Gotham into anarchy, and Forces Batman Closer to crossing the fine line between hero and vigilante. Heath Ledger's casting as the Psychotic Joker was destined for greatness, Maggie Gyllenhaal Joins the cast as Rachel Dawes. Micheal Caine is also back playing Alfred and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Gox. All of the actor's did an amazing job. but Heath Ledger Stole the show as the joker. The Dark Knight is undoubtedly a fine piece of art in the world of Cinema. If you have not watched it yet thinking it's just another super hero movie than i guarantee you will be surprised how Unique it really is."
7513,True,"This movie was: 1. Way too long. 2. Way way too long. 3. Tried to do too much. 4. Made me believe that Jake Gyllenhall is a more believable love interest than his sister. Sorry , she's just very plain looking and a mediocre actress at best. 5. Lost the dialog in an overwhelming music score. 6. Had a horrible script. 7. Ledger is the best thing about the film - but no one could live up to the hype. Sadly he will not be able to reprise this role. 8. Put every good scene in the trailers and fooled everyone by doing so. 9.The people who made this knew it is a stinker and sold it hard on the Net. 10. Had an over and over and over feel to it - I started looking at my watch about 45 minutes into the movie and about every 10 minutes thereafter. I thought it would never end and then the ending was blah.I have read stuff here about Maggie Gyllenhall being a BETTER actress that Katie Holmes. Well she may be but Katie Holmes was much more believable than she was in the role. She was unwatchable. She ruined the movie for me because no one could believe that she was being fought over by two handsome men. I almost puked when the Joker says ""Hello Beautiful"", and some one in the theater actually called out ""She's a beast !"".The first movie was great. This one , just really disappointing.Go see it. I won't have such high expectations again.The honest vote should be a 5 - but I lowered it to account for the deluded and blind."
7514,True,"Alright, Heath Ledger may not be my cup of tea at all in his previous movies but he shines in Dark Knight as never before. The Joker is cool, chaotic and strangely enough... truth worthy. And that seems to be the problem of this film, all the rest is not. I liked the two worlds of Batman Begins a lot, but today it seems as it never existed. Also, Gotham seems a bit dull, boring and not really original - while Tim Burton's Gotham did had that extra what made it not your average capitol. Nolan also didn't reinvent Bruce Wayne, read any of the Largo Winch'es comic novels and you'll understand what I'm saying. Also it seems a lot like the first half is based on to much other movies like Heat, Mission Impossible and even James Bond movies. Maggie Gyllenhaal brings us a mature Rachel which seems a bit out of place and also Aron Eckhart as Two Face seems straight of Pirates of the Caribbean (again quite a contrast with the realism of the film) while as Harvey Dent he is doing a great job. I am not fully convinced, I might have enjoyed Batman Begins even more and this is probably the fault of the big hype. 9,3 at the time of writing on IMDb is seriously overrated. But Heath's Joker, it will not be forgotten."
7515,True,"I deemed it expedient to review the movie, ""The Dark Knight"" due to the positive reviews and acclamations it has unduly received. In actuality ""The Dark Knight"", henceforth to be referred to as TDK, is a trite manifestation of mediocrity that is cataclysmic in proportion. A cinematic travesty; it is the embodiment of mass-produced, assembly-line, manufactured and uncreative pop-cinema that dominates the modern box office. **SPOILER ALERT**.For most of the cast of TDK, the acting was obviously and embarrassingly far below par. Never before in such a high-budget, hyper-over-hyped cinematic enterprise has there been such drab and boring under acting. Christian Bale seemed bored to even be in the movie as if he was waiting to get home to beat his mother. Perhaps he needed someone to tell him how to move his cheeks, lips, eyes brows, and other facial features in order to portray Bruce Wayne. His voice acting is much worse than his facial expressions as he refuses to change its tone or pitch except when he is rasping in an utterly fractious way to disguise his voice when he is in his Batsuit ( this is not often since for a movie about Batman, the character makes surprisingly few appearances ). Christian Bale earns himself a sub review of 0/10 for his portrayal of Bruce Wayne.Maggie Gyllenhaal's acting Rachel Dawes was no better than Christian Bale's, however, as she did not have an annoying rasping ""batvoice"" I would have given her a better rating. Except that her looks, which fall well within the category of ugly, points towards a poor casting decision. It would have been worthwhile to sacrifice acting ability for attractiveness in this case. Movies are venues for good looking performers to showcase certain interesting performances and not for ugly people to attempt vainly to perform at all.Heath Ledger's portrayal of the villain The Joker is the only boon in the otherwise atrocious acting of the film. He is certainly the only actor in TDK that took it upon himself to give a performance. He does a fine job as a menacing and maniacal, albeit, formulaic and predictable villain. His voice as The Joker is much less annoying than the batvoice of Bale. Heath Ledger went as far as he could with the character within the bounds of the contemptible screenplay.TDK has several action scenes. And while some these are intense and somewhat exciting there is nothing unique or particularly breathtaking about them and for the most part they are very manufactured and bland. It is possible that Christian Bale was filmed in a batman suit punching air in front of a green screen for 30 seconds and reused and looped the footage of this for every fighting scene. Batman punches the same generic henchmen (or hostages dressed as henchmen) in almost every scene. He is attacked by dogs TWICE (The capitalization will be explained fully in the next section). The car chase scene halfway through the movie when The Joker attacks the convoy carrying lawyer Harvey Dent was reminiscent of shots from Mad Max over 20 years ago except that everything was dark and covered in shadows. Instead of making things more dramatic and horrifying this just made it hard to see what was happening. Some scenes were entertaining, like the helicopter crashing into the ground (See: Die Hard 4.0 ) and the semi truck flipping (See: The Matrix Reloaded ). The action scenes were well-made, but unoriginal and similar to the action seen too often in recent movies and will hence earn an average rating.One issue that plagues TDK is that some of the more exciting things happened twice and hence one is able to see their flaws and blemishes and be annoyed rather than entertained. For instance Batman is in Hong Kong and crashes through a window to break into a building and kidnap a businessman. Then, later, he crashes through a window to fight The Joker. Batman is also attacked by dogs two times, Gets T-Boned in his ""Batmobile"" by a rocket, and then in his Ferrari by another vehicle. The untalented writers must have run out of ideas half-way through the movie and decided to recycle all of their previous ideas.The screenplay is uncreative, unoriginal, and cliché. From the start of TDK the tone is set to be dark and foreboding. Initially this works, but as the movie lingers on, the darkness becomes boring and the tone becomes more and more annoying. The chaos becomes predictable. Every scene was shot only in shades of gray; the movie could have been shot in black and white and nothing would be missed. The only occasion that primary colors make an appearance is when something explodes. The lines are cliché, but not so much that they add a humorous element and many seem like they are trying to make the audience feel intelligent. Examples of this are quotes such as ""You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain."" Any line such as this is easily made, for instance ""It never bodes well for a movie that tries so hard to be foreboding"", and as such no quotes really leave a lasting impression. There is a palpable feeling within the movie that the movie ITSELF is trying to be good, but, ultimately fails to achieve this task. TDK takes itself much too seriously.Things that were done well include the CGI on Two-Face which adds some color to the otherwise gray Gotham City and whose goofy looking eye can wrench a guffaw out of the most stoic and humorless amongst the audience. The scene where Batman was on his motorcycle was also entertaining and much more creative than most other action scenes in TDK.Suffering from a poor screenplay, statuesque acting, and mediocre and bland action scenes, ""The Dark Knight"" will receive an overall score of 3/10."
7516,True,"Christopher Nolan's approach for Batman again worked. Judging by my observation in a Bangkok cinema on July 17, it will drain at least 150,000,000 both in US and worldwide. This is one of the main movies, if not THE main movie, of the year. But it's not your typical commercial comic hero for many reasons.1, Back in 2005, Batman begins was criticized to be too dark, as a Batman movie. If you still give points to those comments, you will definitely find the Dark Knight even darker, maybe as twice dark as Begins. In the movie, there are virtually no sex, no explicit gore and even no swearing. But there are two main traditional villains, both twisted and horrifying as much as any A-Class horror movie villain. There are main characters died in most miserable circumstances, which made the audiences depressed. There is also a darker conclusion for Batman's fate, and none of the above was presented in a moderate way. 2, Come along the dark messages, is our dear Joker. We know the Joker didn't die; Heath Ledger died instead. There is still a rumor around saying that, it's the Joker, who dragged Ledger into a world of madness and didn't release him from the character, killed Ledger. The rumor can't be justified, but the Joker does jump out of the screen. He threatens everyone on and off the screen in a unusual manner, giving you a chill which makes Jack Nicholson's Joker look like a Disney joker. This is a very daring performance indeed, but dangerous, for the parents may find their children approve the Joker for his logic and his value which work better in the ""real world"". It seems this Batman movie doesn't belong to Batman, but to the Joker, who essentially pushed the whole story forward and destroyed more than just human lives, but also their beliefs in Batman. 3, Batman doesn't own this movie. He is merely a narrator, a firefighter who desperately saves human lives from evil, while witnessing tragedies happening around. Once he want to be proactive, he drags himself into more trouble. Consequently, friends have gone one by another.If we see any development on Batman's character, that should be his loneliness.So, audiences may find Dark Knight a bit more difficult to swallow than Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Hellboy 2 and Hancock. Among all the blockbusters so far, it assumes more thinking and higher IQ from the audiences... Honestly speaking, I can't recommend this to everyone, especially NOT to children.I will recommend it to those who: 1, require a smart script and intelligent quotes. 2, willing to see creative action sequences and less CGIs. 3, not allergic to extreme violence and anarchism. 4, accept the realistic(sometimes pessimistic) messages from a superhero movie. 5, at least 20 years old.Feel free to listen to some lighthearted musics after you see Dark Knight, if you need something to get rid of the mood.9/10 Almost excellent."
7517,True,"I went to see the advanced screening of The Dark Knight on IMAX. My first IMAX experience and boy was I blown away - the screen is HUGE. The main reason I hated this film can be summed up in one word - Batman. I hate Christian Bale's portrayal of Batman. He's plain awful, sorry but that's my personal opinion. Bale is stiff, lifeless and even worst lacks charisma, regardless of whether he's playing Bruce Wayne or Batman. He's so disconnected emotionally that as an audience member I didn't care what happened with him. Heath's Joker knows how to grab you straight away and demand your full attention. While Heath's performance is stellar it does lack the wit and humor you'd expect from the Joker. Whereas Jack Nicholas brought us the fun, over-the-top, magically devious Joker; Heather brings us the sad, dark, and pitiful side of the character. He plays it well, so well in fact, that it becomes a complete downer as you pull into the final minutes of this 2.5 hour non-stop shoot 'em up, throw 'em down, car chase, mob flick. It's beyond me how this movie was able to secure a PG-13 rating when it truly deserves a D rating. D for dark, dreadful, depressing, deep, and distressing. This film takes itself so seriously it's nauseating. It's a superhero movie with zero heart, where even the so-called good guy turns bad in the end. And Batman usually has beautiful love interests. The love interest being played by Maggie Gyllenhaal was simply bad casting. While she's a great actress she lacks any sex appeal and doesn't light up the screen as past women have in the Batman series - counting both film and TV, which says a lot. If only the director could have found a way to inject some LIGHT into Dark Knight I would be able to call this a masterpiece, but alas it's more of a bad nightmare."
7518,True,"I'm not going to comment on individual performances or technical aspects, these are covered elsewhere. What made TDK a disappointment for me was the loss of story halfway through. In the beginning, there are enough coherent scenes, strong supporting cast and even flashes of brilliance to tempt you into sticking with this latest episode in the comic-book-as-film-noir franchise, but TDK loses any sense of scale.The story leaves you high and dry; it loses any relation it had to an engaging story of complex supeheroes and übervillains, and becomes an unnecessarily complicated, overwrought, overstuffed mess. The film becomes like a nightmare fairground, where all the sideshows are at full volume, in your face, and all of them drowning each other out, in the hope that you won't notice that none of them are very interesting at all. Just like that mobile phone multiscreen towards the long-distant end, which doesn't make sense as a plot device, as a technical gizmo, or as anything that one operator could make head ot tail of. Minority Report had a similar imaginary device that looked believable: this wasn't, even in the post-Luc-Besson design world TDK is supposed to inhabit.The point where TDK quite literally loses the plot is when DA Dent is switched to become Two-Face, which would naturally be the point where you would expect the movie to end - except that the Joker isn't anywhere near being dealt with at that point: so TDK has to carry on with a completely new villain in order to resolve the story of the old villain - and it doesn't do that properly either.In all, TDK is like half a good film with a bad one tacked on the end, loaded with flashes and bangs in the hope you won't notice."
7519,True,"I just finished watching two and a half hours of batman and it wasn't enough; I did not want this movie to end! I did not go to the theaters to see this because I am/was not a batman fan nor was I a Heath Ledger fan and then this movie happened. This was an astonishing movie with great performances all around. Heath Ledger was frigging brilliant; it was not until after I watched this movie that I felt saddened by his passing and that I will never get to see him pull off something like this again. Christian Bale was born to play this role he makes all other batmen look like SNL skits. Michael Caine did not have as big of a role as he did in Begins but he transforms Alfred. I can go on and on right down the line with actors and performance but it would take me 10000 words to describe how superb they were. This movie raises questions like a good drama, has plot twist like a good psychological thriller, has action better than any movie I have ever seen; this movie has everything you would want and then so much more. I got so lost in it that I had to remind myself that this is a Batman movie, but any stereotype I harbored towards superhero movies was torn to shreds. this movie makes all other super hero movies look like Saturday morning cartoons. Praise Nolan for such an innovative addition to the Batman saga. This movie along with Ledger deserves an Oscar hands down; give them the damn Oscar, PLEASE!"
7520,True,"I've seen many good movies in my life and this just isn't a 9.1. Not even close. A solid 7 but otherwise a forgettable movie. I'd argue the Burton films were better and more ground breaking. Do they have Oscars for marketing though? Because the marketing for this movie is great! Anyway, I just saw the Dark Knight and what I saw was a lot of special effects but nothing you haven't seen before. And really, the jet powered tank thing is getting old. Putting SUV like wheels on it is I guess a sign of the times. Glad it blew up, good riddance.Then there was the plot with huge holes in it and a sickening amount of moralism. You'd almost hope this joker guy would kick some batman ass this time to put this bat out of his misery. The guy deserves it for a wooden performance. I think only Val Kilmer was worse.What I missed most though was the complete and utter absence of humor. Come on, it's a cartoon. It's supposed to be funny. Jack Nicholson was hilarious as the Joker. Heath just isn't funny. True, he wasn't trying to either.But the kicker: not a single bat. Bats were nowhere to be seen and the bat cave was replaced by a garage in some office building. What's a batman film without bats, no cave, and no sense of humor?! Anyway, OK action movie and the pop corn crowd no doubt has a good evening. No doubt Heath will get an Oscar but that will be cause he OD'ed rather than of his exceptional acting performance. Oscars work like that."
7521,True,"I know giving The Dark Knight a perfect ten might not be highly original,but this film really does deserve it.Having said that there are a couple of things that bothered slightly but they weren't enough to really have an impact on my score.But more on those things a bit later i'll start with the good things.First off the cinematography is a big step up from the first film,more in the fight scenes than anything else,I know Christopher Nolan had intended the scenes to be hard to see because we were seeing Batman fight from the perspective of the criminals but it never really sat well with me only because i'm just not a fan at that kind of thing in the slightest,Also with such an unknown fighting style I really wanted to see how it worked,well know Christopher has decided to fix that and pans along with the action rather than cutting all over the place.Next up is the music and it's wonderful, it perfectly captures the mood and helps tie you with the characters emotions,I really love the creepy ticking/scraping sound at the beginning logos.The writing for this film is set to go down with the best scripts in cinema history,with so much happening it would have been easy to fall into the trap of it not making any sense at all or trying to fit so much in that it got boring,but that's not the case,I was always interested in what was going to happen next and everything was written so well that i was never confused as to what was happening.Now the acting,I don't think there was one person in this film who didn't do a great job,Christian Bale was excellent as Bruce Wayne/Batman,at many points in this film you see the internal struggle that's happening inside him and at other times complete hopelessness,like he just doesn't know what to do,Aaron Eckhart gives Harvey Dent a real purpose and creates a very good, honest, likable character who you really feel sorry for when he eventually falls,whats more I could understand what his pain was and why he was doing the bad things he ended up doing.Maggie Gylannhaal is just a hell of a better actress than Katie Holmes will ever be,Maggie gives Rachel soul and a reason for being,all Katie Holmes gave was this smarmy little smirk on her face that I just wanted to smack off.Micheal Caine,Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman all gave their usual great performances,but the one everyone's talking about is Heath.There's not much to say that hasn't already been said by every other person on the planet so i'll say that it's all true,no performance i've seen has had this impact on me,i'll never forget it.One of the things that really make the Joker work for me personally is the way he is always licking his lips,i really works in two ways,one is it's like a tick he has just because he's crazy and second if I have those scars around my mouth i'd probably feel them with my tongue constantly too.So there was really only two things that bothered me and that was that I didn't feel the city was the same,obviously going from a giant set to filming in Chicago it will look different,but it just seemed to go from this giant dark Gothic city with things overhanging everywhere to.....well Chicago.Last but not least I think the Scarcrow was wasted in this film,it felt too much like they were just trying to get him out the way so we wouldn't have to worry about him,they could have just not put him in and it would've done well to save him as the enemy if they chose make another film,but I guess they needed a reason to introduce the Batman copycats.This is the best movie you will see this year,if there's anyone left that hasn't seen it see it at the movies at least once,because it just won't be the same on DVD."
7522,True,"The expectation was huge and it was certainly accomplished. The Dark Knight, is much more than just a summer blockbuster. The story, the psychology of the characters and the dilemma Batman faces are very well created. The special effects and action complement the story and not the other way around (someone said Pirates of the Caribean?). The detail that made me give it the 9 and not the 10 is the ending, in which Batman wants to suffer in the most absurd and stupid way, so people watches him as a public enemy to save the real enemy from all the evil he did: Harvey ""Two Face"" Dent, which didn't need to die keeping in mind that he is one of Bat's most formidable foes. Christian Bale confirms that he is the best actor of his generation and Heath Ledger has become the greatest villain in cinema history (got that Jack?)."
7523,True,After seeing The Dark Knight for 3 times and studying it my research I finally know why everybody keeps going back to the theaters to see it again.The Dark Knight has a powerful love story between Rachel and Harvey which reminds me of Titanic. The reason I say this by the end of the movie Harvey lost everything just like Rose lost Jack at the end of Titanic.The Joker played by the late Heath Ledger is terrific and keeps the audience on its toes and you never know what he's about to do next. Heath made the movie better than ever.Everything about this movie is perfect. The reason everyone keeps going back to see The Dark Knight over and over again is because it's close home. Reminds us of the 9/11 attacks and what's really going on in our world today.Now the big question remains Will The Dark Knight beat Titanic's record? If I had answer right now I would have to say yes it will. After looking at the stats for the movie it's not that far off from beating it. Recent articles I've read about various studios including Warner Bros. say it won't happen. We'll just have to wait and see what happens.
7524,True,"The only reason I wanted to watch Batman Begins or The Dark Knight was because Christian Bale played Batman. That's it. I think he's one of the best actors in Hollywood today, and I gave BB a chance because of him. He did not disappoint, bringing the right amount of pathos and heroism to the caped crusader, quite possibly creating the best big screen portrayal of the character ever. I really liked Batman Begins because it made us care about everyone in it, we even feel sympathy for the villain because we get at least a glimpse of why he does what he does, and that he has people he once cared about. At one point anyway, we know the villain in the first film wasn't a complete monster. We care about the minor characters because we see that they care about Bruce and/or Bruce cares about them, and we get to know Bruce pretty well. We feel his pain, his anger, his frustration, and we are uplifted by the fact that this man who could so easily choose to be a villain chooses instead to be a hero. Batman Begins, quite simply, tugs at your heartstrings, while providing some good action and a plot. The Dark Knight is just chaos, in every sense of the word. If it was Nolan's intention that most of the time we wouldn't know what was happening or why, he succeeded. I just didn't understand it, to put it plainly. Maybe, since the Joker was a chaotic villain, the movie was supposed to support that. If so, it did it's job. I also couldn't keep up with all the characters, or their purpose. What WAS the point of the focus on the mob? Why the mob, the Joker, and Harvey Dent/Two Face in the same movie, and Gordon's family being threatened in the same movie? There was just too much going on, too much action, and not enough reaction. Alfred was almost nonexistent..and here's the kicker: so was Batman. In a movie about BATMAN, you'd think Christian Bale would have a bigger part. He did a great job with what he was given, but he was almost a glorified extra. Harvey Dent got to show more of a reaction out of Rachel's death than Bruce did. That's a shame. Nolan really needs to go back to basics and put some heart back in the script. It was almost like BB and TDK were directed by two different people. The two movies certainly bear no resemblance to each other. Where was the heart? Sorely missing in this one, I'm afraid. Nlan went all ""style over substance"" in TDK. Not impressed. If you're a die-hard fan of any of the actors as I am Bale, or a die-hard Batman fan, it's worth a watch, but otherwise....skip it."
7525,True,"Its always hard to write for a movie, that has been so well made. First my congratulations and regards to the whole ""The Dark Knight"" team for making such an exceptionally well movie.Now, where to begin....hmm...let me see... I will start with the line that The Joker keeps on saying in the movie... ""Why so Serious?"".... after watching a movie one always feels this happiness inside him/her that he/she has just watched a good movie.... but this movie actually makes you serious... in the sense of thought process that one is bound to have once gotten out of the theaters....Batman has always been called the caped crusader of justice, and believe me, this movies explains it why he is called so..... the development of the characters, the contrast that they make on each other is shown in such a nice way, that a person actually feels that its not a movie but something real that is going on.... after a long time i have seen someone giving such depth to the movie.... Before this it was the ""HULK"" the one directed by Ang Lee which portrayed the characters so well....Batman's concern for the city, his actions to bring justice in Gotham, his belief in Harvey dent and in Gordon who is the only one non-corrupted cop, his tries to do the things in the rightful manners so that he is accepted by the society.... he thing is shown such beautifully. On the other hand Harvey Dents belief in the law and order, his trust in batman and Gordon is something worth noticing... and Gordon's trust in batman that he is one person who is not going to do anything wrong. Each of these factors contrast all the three character to one another. Its so because all of them are fighting for one thing. ""JUSTICE"".But this time its not the batman that steals the show. It's The Joker. What one can ask more in a villain. The basic categories that a villain carries are cunning, psychos (in a way), and most of all the amount of oppositeness they portray from the hero. The Joker fulfills them all. But the liveliness to the character is brought by the fabulous acting by heath ledger, who has given on of his best performances ever. The way he has acted, i guess no other would have done it so well. A performance worth being awarded.Joker is actually in all sense the ultimate villain Batman can ask for, because of the oppositeness he shows to the later.Further talking about the movie the screenplay and the story are so much intriguing that, one will not know when the time flies by, cause a person gets so much engrossed in the movie, that he will even forget that he has just purchased some pop-corn to eat (actually happened with me and i realized it when half the movie was over. The story has a good flow to it, and also the background score is excellent. I can't really wait for the next sequel in this series to come out.Ending my review here and not further spoiling the fun.... I would recommend all those who have still not seen the movie, to go and see it and enjoy it as much as they can."
7526,True,"I love ""Batman Begins"" and was curious how they could top that as a Batman movie. I was never a huge fan of the Batman films of the 80's/90's and it was because I thought they were too flashy and colorful and not nearly dark enough. So, when ""Batman Begins"" came out I was psyched to see that they put a real human element and created a superhero that you believed could do half the stuff that he was doing! At the end of Batman Begins they announced the Joker would be the villain in the next film and I was a bit worried. Simply because every Joker I had seen was too comedic, and not dark enough. And then when I heard that Heath Ledger would be portraying him I really was worried. Not that I didn't think Heath was a good actor, in fact I thought he was great in the Patriot, and Brokeback Mountain, I just couldn't imagine such a ""handsome"" man playing the Joker.Chris Nolan's vision proved me wrong. MY GOD did Heath Ledger perform. I really wanted this Joker to be psychotic and I was fulfilled beyond my imagination! Ledger puts everything into this performance and it's creepy, funny, disturbing, and just plain brilliant. I know that no one could've imagined Ledger's tragic death, but even though he is gone I don't think Nolan planned to bring Joker back. I think when Joker says at the end ""We are destined to continue doing this forever"" to Batman it's Nolan telling us that it's an ongoing battle that batman will fight, but we don't need to see it so much.They should not bring the Joker back. To me it would be an insult to Ledgers performance. No one will top that, EVER! He was perfect in the role and that should cement that character on the silver screen for eternity.The rest of the cast is awesome as well. Bale as Batman/Wayne is great again. He is the best Batman/Wayne that there's been to date. And I like the fact that he said he'll be Batman until they want to bring in Robin. Please Hollywood, keep that sidekick out of the series. It just doesn't translate well on the big screen.So, why am I giving this 9 out of 10 stars and not 10. There is one scene that I thought did not belong in the movie, and it was near the beginning which had me a little worried at first. I understand the reasoning behind it, but I didn't like that they brought Scarecrow back for one scene. It felt, to me, like the actor that plays Scarecrow was looking for a paycheck and I didn't think they needed the ""Fake Batmen"" needed to be helping capture that villain. They could've just had some random thug, I don't know why they had to bring him back just for that.But, that is a very minor complaint and the movie is simply amazing. It's playing in Imax around here and I can't wait to go back and see it at that theater!"
7527,True,"Wowzers, where do you begin with this film? Epic makes it sounds like a long film where your buttocks begin to get numb and you start fidgeting NOT in this film WOW, from the initial opening sequences until the credits roll a whole 152 minutes later you're a gripped to the screen wondering why has it taken so long for this franchise to get all the right ingredients together to make such a kick ass film? At the end of this film I was breathless, the action didn't overwhelm the film the melancholy didn't overwhelm this film; the balance was struck with deft precision. The actors didn't ham it up as in previous instalments (prior to Batman Begins naturally) and you truly feel empathy for the characters, even the Joker! Ledgers character shared his past whilst committing some fiendish crimes, giving an insight as to why his life had gotten him to this point. I suppose there are going to be inevitable comments made as to Ledgers performance in this role due to his untimely death. It would be disingenuous to praise his role out of sympathy, luckily this is not necessary. Ledgers performance in this movie only reminds us of the terrible loss we suffer from him no longer being with us.Moving swiftly on, Christian Bale continues his solid portrayal of Batman and builds on his previous outing in 'Batman Begins'. The only tiny criticism I have is Bale himself when he gives interviews he is soooo dull, other than that, the role he plays is great (I suppose that is what a good actor does, take note Mark Wahlberg) Michael Cain is, well, Michael Cain, the man is a legend in his own lifetime and following this performance only adds to his kudos. Aaron Eckhart has at last got a role he can get his teeth into; hopefully this will lead to other work. The switch to Maggie Gyllenhaal for the role of Rachel was an inspired choice and pays off. It's a pity her role won't be revived! Lastly we see Gary Oldman reprise his role as James Gordan. The Gordan role second time out is expanded and supports the rest of the film very well. Oldman has been vastly underutilised in recent years, hopefully this will be rectified.There will be calls to make this into a trilogy and rightly so, however in the rush to make a third instalment I would urge caution to Christopher Nolan not to be rushed to into something to cater to the studio's lust for more profits.."
7528,True,"Before we begin, I'd like to reveal something about myself. I am not a fan of Batman. That is not to say I dislike Batman, but I have never been especially driven to seek out adventures and merchandise pertaining to Gotham's favourite costumed watchdog. Prior to seeing Knight, the only two Batman movies I have seen in full are Batman and Robin and Batman Begins. I'm not about to pass harsh judgment on either - I admit B&R was quite amusing in a rather unintentional way and that Batman Begins was a well-crafted film (but I do not consider it to be a masterpiece in any way). At the very least, it set the bar high for its successor, and rather high up at that.I know there's a thread floating around here with the first five minutes of Knight in it. I never looked at it here, seeing it for the first time on an IMAX screen. This opening scene alone - which follows a bank robbery, and that is all I shall say about it - gives a very good indication of just how highly Knight sets its own bar. It burns its way into your head and lets you know that the next two-and-a-half hours are going to be quite a step up from what you were probably expecting.Plot-wise, you should have a fairly good idea what's going on. There's Batman and there's the Joker and there's the usual kind of plot complications that dog the ""superhero sequel"", namely the whole act of strongly humanising the hero (just like all the other ""2"" movies). I'm not about to deride Knight for its few clichéd plot devices - show me a blockbuster sequel without them. It's what the plot gets surrounded with that will truly impress you.First off, the acting. A serious sequel demands very strong character development. Seeing as a lot of you are hardened moviegoers, you no doubt already know that. Of course, Knight sticks to this ""rule"". But how it does is impressive. The cast is impressive. Aside from strong returns from Caine, Oldman and Freeman, you have the introduction of a handful of new characters that will stick around in viewers' memories longer than, say, the Scarecrow.Obviously, the first thing to come to mind is the Joker. Naturally I was wary of all the hype surrounding Heath Ledger's oh-so-epic final role. Could it really be as good as everybody was saying? The answer is a loud and hearty YES. Ledger is quite simply a showstopper. He steals more scenes than the Joker steals loot. His presence is simply commanding. Right from one of the earliest scenes (which I won't spoil with anything other than the phrase ""magic trick"") he takes hold and doesn't let go. Whether this talk of an Oscar is far-fetched or not, I can honestly see a nomination happening. I kept thinking to myself, ""This is Ledger?"" And when an actor is capable of doing that, well that is a good actor indeed. Now I can see how much of a tragedy his death truly is.The other character of note is Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent (best known to fans for becoming Two-Face). Granted, Eckhart does not do as much show-stealing as Ledger, but his performance is carefully played and very convincing as he goes through a number of stages, from smooth and trusty to thinly veiled psychopathy. When his transformation into Two-Face is revealed, it is one hell of a shock (and a damned good effects job).Ironically, for a movie titled The Dark Knight, it seems like Christian Bale as the eponymous character is overshadowed by the aforementioned examples. Granted, this is because Bale is quite simply not a showboating kind of actor (at least in my experience), and that makes a fine contrast to the Joker's wild streak. Also, Maggie Gyllenhaal doesn't really make that much of a better Rachel than Katie Holmes did, but it's a forgivable flaw in an otherwise brilliant spot of casting.Of course, being a summer blockbuster (or winter, as the case may be), it just wouldn't be a superhero movie without a hefty helping of action sequences. The action is par for the course - there's chases, fights, even a couple of handfuls of suspenseful ""beat-the-clock"" moments. There are a handful of moments which induce laughs or a collective ""Whoa"" from the audience (namely, the Batpod). The inclusion of the Joker and his penchant for playing tricks make for some truly interesting setpieces, especially the ""social experiment"" he pulls near the climax.Then we get to the ending. While it's not a cliffhanger, it really does end on a rather ambiguous note (kind of like The Road Warrior did) which sort of leaves it open for a third film, but at the same time doesn't, if that makes any sense. It could've been handled better, I suppose, but it's all about leaving them wanting more and the ending - which shows that things are only going to get much worse for Batman - certainly illustrates that.The Dark Knight really did manage to pull off a miracle. It lived up to all of its hype (both pre- and post-Ledger's demise) and it indicates that not all blockbusters are going to pot. The only problem I can see this creating is that if there is a third instalment in this new trilogy (which, in all probability, there will be) it probably will not manage to top this one. This will be a one-of-a-kind, and who knows, maybe in 30 years' time when people are talking about which sequels were better than the original, the first movie to pop up will be The Dark Knight."
7529,True,"(Warning! Lots of Spoilers! Only read if you've seen the film!)Batman has leaped straight out of the comic book pages and into the real world. To compare ""The Dark Knight"" to say the ""Spider-Man"" franchise for example, is almost a joke. The reboot ""Batman Begins"" established Batman in the real world, and now the sequel takes that an entire step forward. ""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a great comic book movie, its a masterpiece.It's been a little over a day since I've seen ""The Dark Knight"". It really lingers in the mind after a while, even if you're not a big fan of Batman you will be of this future classic crime drama. As I've pondered over the film more and more, I've come to understand it's many complexities.Since the first film, the mob is getting more and more desperate to launder their cash. Why? Because Batman has been cleaning up the streets and cops and lawyers can no longer be bought. The Joker is employed by the mob to take down the Batman and bring corruption back to Gotham. Until Batman turns himself in, The Joker will continue to kill people. Is Batman a hero? Or just a vigilante looking for self righteousness?While re watching ""The Prestige"" the other day, knowing the twist ending, it was beautiful to see how well crafted it was. How much little things that may seem like padding are actually hints that apply to the symbolism of the entire film. The same goes for ""The Dark Knight"". Not only is it a good picture that stays true to the characters and stories of Batman, like ""Batman Begins"" did, but its really an artful film. Thats a lot to say for a movie based off of a comic book.As the credits started to roll I wondered what the plot twist was. I thought to myself ""There must not be one in this film"", little did I know how subtle it was. Upon further pondering I figured it out. Bale replies to Caine in one scene ""Batman has no limits"". That statement is both true and false. The Joker tempts Batman to ""break his one rule"".Another part of the film that has deep meaning is The Joker. We know from the film that The Joker was somehow abused in the past. So he has lost all faith in people. There is evil in everyone. Two sides one ""coin"". The Joker strives to create dramatic examples. By corrupting Batman, their White Knight, and themselves. ""When it comes down to it, every man for himself, every person is evil"" is his basic logic. The Joker acknowledges that he is morally wrong, but wants to prove it to Batman and everyone else in Gotham that they are not much different from himself (Thats a little Killing Joke for you).The films puts you into a an exciting roller coaster, and a rather abrupt, yet beautiful ending that will leave you stunned. The story is intelligent and action-packed, it is wonderfully well acted to create great characters, and it really speaks to you.Batman breaks the law for justice, the city who he protects hates him, and yet he still fights injustice for the right reasons. To keep an eight year old's parents from dying. He will only stop when the evil that created Batman is gone. Thats what a hero is. A+"
7530,True,"I'm sorry but I'm not being paid to write these reviews and it sure looks like those ahead of me are. Did we see the same picture? I thought it was too long, confusing, poor plot line, very very dark, a lot of gratuitous violence and Ledger's performance was just not Oscar material as so many are proclaiming. During the movie several people got up and left. There were a couple of times there my date and I thought about leaving but we paid premium bucks to see the thing and you hate wasting money like that.The film gets off to a pretty good start. We were all excited but as it went along it began to drag. Ledger looks awful and they relied enitrely on makeup (with no prosthetics they way they did with Nicholson) to give you the impression of a smiling joker. Here it was just white and red makeup piled on the way a six-year old might do after getting into mommy's makeup. And dark. Everything was so dark throughout the film that each time someone opened a flip phone it was as bright as a flashlight! (I thought, surely they aren't going to call anyone but because so many were doing it I figured they were looking at the time - a sure sign that the film was lumbering along.)From this viewer's perspective I thought it was awful."
7531,True,"I'm at awe of how highly rated this movie is. Honestly, I feel bad even giving it a five. This is coming from a comic, movie and Batman buff.*spoilers begin* The Joker was awesome. However I got a more sadistic feeling from him rather than laughy jokey. His jokes weren't all too funny. However, I still enjoyed his character. Action could be OK. Sometimes it was poorly done though. Same goes for the acting..This movie was way to long and was very scattered. I'm still wondering what the Scarecrow was doing in the movie at all. Also the eyeliner and mascara of the mayor... There were a lot of pointless added things. As mentioned before, the city didn't have a very Gotham look or feel.This movie focused a lot on the cops. I don't mind cop thrillers and such but I went to see Batman vs. The Joker...not the life and times of all of Gotham City.They should have waited to give Two-Face his own movie. As mentioned before if he really wanted revenge he'd kill the Joker not take the cop's family hostage and threaten to kill the son as payback.One thing that really bothered me though...they have all these videos of the Joker making obvious threats to kill people until Batman unmasks himself...they catch the Joker and ""Oh no we can't do anything but hold him until morning because we have nothing on him."" Then when the Joker has a cop hostage, they don't shoot him. Instead they give him the cell phone so he can trigger a bomb inside some guy's stomach. That with the boat scene...As if they'd really wait it out. It did kind of make me smile when the one convict threw the detonator out the window. There were multiple plot holes and this movie probably could have been cut in half. The ending was rather cliché and blah. I definitely enjoyed some scenes...but I'd often find myself wondering when it would end. It's doubtful I'd watch this movie again..aside from wanting to see the Joker."
7532,True,"I have enjoyed every outing of Batman till I watched 'The Dark Knight' and 'Batman Begins.' The basic story, from a comic book, is a comic story. As soon as it is put into a semblance of real life it fails. The main character is a man who dresses up as a bat. This is funny. The Dark Knight trilogy is made by people with no sense of humor. Who cares about lunatics that wear weird costumes and commit crimes? In the real world these pathetic folks would be locked up. The original Batman TV show and Tim Burton's outings maintain the humor inherent in the story. Subtract the humor and you have long dull scenes in between action sequences. Get rid of the long talky scenes and the Dark Knight films would be fair action films. If you are like me and prefer light and humor, these films are not for you. Even 'Breaking Bad' had some humor in it. I maintain that Batman is inherently humorous and thus the Dark Knight series fails to capture or honor the original."
7533,True,"I found this movie too pretentious, too long and too boring. Christian Bale is wooden in his role, with his lips firmly squeezed together all the time. And his voice as Batman... Whah-Grah... Ridiculous. Maggie Gyllenhaal irritated me with constant(ironic?)smile on her face. The plot has serious holes. There are some unbelievable turnovers. During Major's speech, no one noticed a crazy guy with big scars in police uniform? And Joker manages to take over police station using a knife? Or a sequence when Batman runs into him on his motorcycle(or something like that) and then turns in the last second almost killing himself, because he is too good to kill a madman. What about Two-Face, who speaks and acts normally, although a half of his face is missing? The end is not very convincing: Batman took a guilt on himself, just to save a hope for citizens of Gotham? Give me a break. Fighting scenes could be better. It seems that Batman is a master of slow-motion fighting style. All in all... Very overrated movie."
7534,True,"I have already written a review for this film. When I was Sirus the virus. But now I feel that I must make another one. Cause when I first started writing reviews, they were just one paragraph. Which I didn't like. so, now, I am re writing it, and making it into much more than one paragraph.Christopher Nolan, the mastermind behind The Prestige and Memento, continues the magic that he made with 2005's Batman begins. But makes it a ton better. Sometimes good sequels are rare. Most of the time, finding a sequel that surpasses the original is harder to find. That's because The Dark knight is like no other sequel. Or like no other film i've ever seen. It's by far the greatest movie i've ever seen.It really is. There is so much great involved with this film. It has so much to love. So many memorable moments here. So much to love. I shal start already. For one thing there are a ton of great performances. So many memorable ones. This was Heath ledger's last full performance, and his best. The Joker is not just a villain. He may be incredibly evil, but you know kind of where he comes from. He has a good reason to do what he does. No I don't agree that he should kill people but you know where he comes from.The Dark knight shows us that though there is madness in the world that even a city doesn't have to be pure evil.That they can stay united. The Dark knight has dialogue like no other comic book movie. Or like no Batman movie. No"" Holy rusted metal Batman!"" None of that cheesiness. Nolan knew that that series was headed for disaster and came back with two great movies. One of them the greatest of all time. The plot is pretty simple. Continuing from Batman begins, Batman(played by Christian Bale), Gordon(played by Gary Oldman), and the new district attorney Harvey Dent(played by Aaron Eckhart)try to bring down the crime rate in Gotham city. But they face bigger troubles against The Joker(played terrificly by Heath Ledger)who raises it. The Joker tries to bring down Batman and all of the heroes in Gotham.Bruce Wayne(Batman obviously) is caught in a love triangle between Harvey and his old friend Rachael(played by Maggie Gylenhaal, quite the upgrade on Katie Holmes). Rachael is in love with Harvey, and Bruce is in love with Rachael. But she knows that they can't be together and so does he cause he risks his life all the time.This truly is an amazing film. Because of this movie, they have changed the original five best picture nominees to ten. I mean that is a crime even worse than what the Joker could do. I mean it wasn't even nominated.You actually feel sorry for these characters. you care about them. You see the rise and fall of heroes. The Dark knight is not just a comic book movie. Okay it is, but it's much more than that. There are so many crowd pleasing moments, so much awe, so much everything. It's not just a comic book movie though. It's part action movie, part romance, part drama, part romance, part suspense. Back in 2008, before the film came out, i knew it would be the number one movie of the year. Nobody else did though. Well, it became one of the top three biggest films of all time. It's an amazing movie. When I saw the midnight showing back in 2008 I knew I was going to love it. and it's the best movie i've ever seen."
7535,True,"What really makes this movie great is the way it can make you feel twisted. Ledger as the Joker is marvelous. He says that he has no plans, money is meaningless, it's all about the message. He's trying to send the message that we are all a little corrupt, we're all a little off, and we just need to be pushed. The human mind is a fragile thing. As dark as this movie is you are frequently laughing. The Joker takes a man's life with a joke, the disappearing pencil, sick and disgusting, yet everyone is laughing. Every scene with Ledger leaves you laughing and feeling as if you are the most terribly gruesome person. Why are you laughing, he's murdering people. We are corrupt. That is what he believes, and that's what he shows you. It's sick."
7536,True,"The best Batman film yet. Deep plot, a charismatic villain and equally charismatic hero..The Dark Knight is not a story about Batman, but a story of Gotham in response to Batman's arrival. The theme of escalation, the classic notion of good versus evil, chaos versus order, and what a hero truly is, is present in the whole movie... but it was rather cramped in a way that it was somewhat difficult to understand it all with just one sitting.What's the most amazing thing about this movie is how accurate the characters are portrayed in the spirit of the comics. Batman now is more involved in detective work (which other movies, even Begins, explored little to naught)... Gordon (Oldman) is now more active, and much more explored here more, portrayed as a desperate cop trying to clean the streets, but getting trapped in his own dealings... the Joker, who finally is represented right (even if he does wear make-up) not as a prankster criminal... but as a true agent of chaos.Ledger had nailed him as a definitive Joker for the live action movies. How he acts, his 'plans', even his odd sense of humor. By the pictures, you see a grungy, dirty looking madman... you'd think he'd be so serious... but he is not. I could count how many times he made me, and the audience laugh. He tells Batman the duality of their nature and relationship, even wishing how he would want to do this forever... this is truly one of the best Joker portrayals in history. Disturbing, yet funny.A masterpiece."
7537,True,"Breathtaking movie! Enjoyed every minute of it.Spoiler Alert - My favorite scene. When the joker leaves the hospital in his nurse outfit and fumbles around with detonator to finally hitting the right button, and an awesome explosion ensues, now that's filmamking at its best!! Batman's cycle is pure eye candy, and Gotham city never looked better! The key to a great super heroe movie is a super villain. Heath Ledger takes the Joker role to the peak of evil. He steals every scene in the movie and becomes the baddest of the baddies yet he has his principles.Great job!!! A Blu-Ray must have!!"
7538,True,"I'm not a huge fan of the whole superhero genre, but I have always been a Batman fan - and trust me, to call The Dark Knight a superhero movie is almost an insult. Everything that (in my opinion at least) makes a film brilliant is in here - the acting is outstanding, the story is totally gripping, the musical score is brilliant, and the pacing is so fast that those 152 minutes just fly past in what seems like virtually no time at all.The aspect of this film that I think deserves the most amount of praise is by far the acting as it really is outstanding. Believe the hype around Heath Ledger's performance especially; his portrayal of the Joker is so vivid and gripping that he is genuinely frightening in some scenes (this is definitely not a film for kids; I'm a bit surprised that it got away with a 12 certificate). The other actor who really stands out for me is Aaron Eckhart, bringing a new depth to the character of Harvey Dent/Two-Face and completely dragging him away from comics such as The Long Halloween (as the director Christopher Nolan has done with the entire Batman franchise so far). And, of course, who can forget the performances from the actors such as Christian Bale and Gary Oldman, who are just as brilliant in this film as they were in Batman Begins.The Dark Knight is a film that is wonderfully, brutally dark, and contributes enormously to the whole new dimension of the Batman universe that Christopher Nolan has created. It has a very deep, complex storyline, and manages to be dark without being too overpowering (there are still some laugh-out-loud moments, particularly a very memorable one involving the Joker, a bodyguard and a pencil). If you think you're ready for a Batman film that has all this and much more, then watch it. You won't be disappointed."
7539,True,"I rarely get all giddy over a movie these days. Few catch my imagination. Batman Begins was OK, more importantly it showed the direction which the franchise will be taking and it gave me hope. I heard a lot of hype, especially over the performance of Heath Ledger and it started to build my anticipation. Boy oh boy were my expectations wrong.Not only is this the best superhero/comic book movie ever made, the finest example of it's genre, it is also a superb action thriller in it's own right. Where to begin in describing just how awesome this movie is? My main issue with Batman Begins was the lack of a captivating nemesis for Batman to lock horns with. When I heard that Heath Ledger was to play the Joker, I had my doubts. I heard all of the hype but didn't get caught up in it. The hype was justified. He is electric. Whilst the previous incarnation of the Joker on the big screen was wonderfully done, he was not menacing. Ledger creates a character wrought with menace. He is at times funny, intimidating and always creepy. He manages to steal every scene that he is in, few times have I felt so joyed to watch an actor perform like this.Whilst Ledger's name has and still is linked to Oscar speculation, when watching the movie I couldn't shake the feeling and idea that the movie as a whole was Oscar worthy. It didn't feel like a superhero film, it was down to earth enough to make it almost believable. Nolan really goes for it in the action scenes and delivers a sublime film with a truly thrilling plot. This is what going to the movies is all about.Whilst not flawless, it is a remarkable film. There were some plot issues that annoyed me, mainly towards the end when certain things were sprung out of nowhere which I wasn't too keen on, but the overall excellence of the film makes this forgivable. I have heard critics slate the decision to miss out the workings of the Jokers plot, the way in which he could just rig an entire building to explode with seemingly effortless ease. I however felt this added to the menace of the character, not only is he insane, he is a criminal genius, a master terrorist.Whilst all the main actors gave strong performances, Heath Ledgers being the one of most note, I would also like to commend Aaron Eckhart's performance as Harvey Dent, his addition to the plot gave it an extra dimension and he played it well.To conclude, this is one of the best movies of 2008 and I will be sorely disappointed if 1 - Heath Ledger does not get a posthumous Oscar nomination and 2 - if the movie does not get a nomination for best film."
7540,True,"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"". Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars"
7541,True,"This film's hype was indescribably ridiculous. The film was good but the hype was well not really needed. You could have just gotten up from bed and went to the mall and watch a good old' batman movie but nope the hype helped.Enough about the hype and more about the film itself. It was GREAT. The story was well developed the action was realistic and good but one character is really loved by the fans, Heath Ledger's Joker. He was great in this film and his death is a terrible terrible shame but I watched this film twice in the cinemas(yes it's THAT good)and seriously this guy has talent but he's the main villain and that's all he is, A psychopathic murderer. Bale still talks in that stupid voice as Batman and it's very annoying. I'll include some spoilers so if you won't watch it yet don't read this part. -------------------------SPOILERS----------------------------------- Harvey's transformation into Two-Face was well played. I seriously doubt I can survive my face burning but he's just great like that. Rachel dying in here was like *beep* yeah no more horrible actors to play but I hope Bruce finds another girl in the third film.Well so that's it!A 9/10 for a movie that had a ridiculous hype."
7542,True,"OK, so I haven't written a review in a long time, and upon seeing this film I thought it was high time I did.Everything about this film surpassed my expectations. I have to admit that I only really went to see it because I was already a fan of Heath Ledger and Michael Caine. I had previously seen Batman Begins and really didn't think it was all that amazing. But after seeing the trailers for the film I decided to give it a go, seeing as it was also Ledgers last finished role.The special effects were fantastic and I think the makeup in this film was easily some of the best I have ever seen. The plot kept me entertained until the very end and it was both thought provoking and humorous at times.Some of the performances may be overshadowed by Ledgers last and iconic role, but I could not fault any of them. Christian Bale did a magnificent job as the lead character, and all supporting actors did brilliantly.However in my personal opinion, the portrayal of the joker was what made the film. I think everything about it was spot on and he stole every scene quite comfortably from his fellow actors. I think the mix of humour helped the film enormously, the make-up was great, the costume and even down to the quirky habits of the character, which have made it such a memorable performance. Easily one of the most iconic and hopefully remembered rolls of all time.A great last performance from the late, great Heath Ledger. He will be missed, but his films will live on forever. May he rest in peace."
7543,True,"When films get as much hype as this the advertising backfires. Everyone knows that the movie is coming out with all the unnecessary hype. It builds up an anticlimax because any flaws in the film become glaring.This is a very good film and by now most people will have seen it.; But its certainly not as great as many seem to think. There are some great set pieces and all the stunts and explosions have been done the old fashioned way without drowning in CGI. Christopher Nolan has written an intelligent script which is unusual and sets it apart form most big summer movies. Ledger's performance has been lauded by almost everyone and his shadow has obscured Christian Bale's performance who would otherwise be receiving the plaudits.The story unfolds with glamour and deftness but does suffer from being overlong. Of the many actors who have been overlooked it time to mention Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow. He has th added difficulty of performing from behind a mask and he does an excellent job. Aaron Eckhart's, Harvey Dent is such a major character and his performance matches this. The women in the film who are overlooked include Melinda McGraw's Barbara Gordon; and Maggie Gyllenhaal is so much better than Katie Homlmes.Living in London I was quite excited that the stage and screen actor Stephen Armourae was in this. I've seen some short films that aren't listed on this site. Difficult to find him in the movie and clearly appears to briefly. If you reappears in the next it must be with more screen time.The Dark Knight asks uncomfortable questions about justice and morality. Its a mature film presented as a summer blockbuster."
7544,True,"Well where do i begin! I've been excited about seeing this film since seeing the trailer back towards the start of the year and being a big fan of the batman movies my expectations were extremely high. I went to see the film the weekend it came to cinemas and was worried it wouldn't live up to my expectations nor the hype surrounding it. But wow! i never expected it to ever be as good as it was. The story was outstanding and for a batman film actually quite complicated there were a lot of twists and turns and you never knew what was coming next. As with the acting it was phenomenal best performances being from Micheal Caine , Aaron Eckart , Garry Oldman and of course Heath Ledger who played what in my opinion was not only the best on screen villain of all time but quite possibly the best role in a film ever. This combined with some amazing memorable scenes and in parts this film is hilarious mostly delivered from Bale and Ledger and the occasional tip of the hat from freeman!. Although there was a tremendous amount of big names in here it was done brilliantly giving them all decent time in the film. And although the film ran at roughly 2 and a half hours you never wanted it to end for one second. Action fans need not worry as there are some out of this world action scenes and although this film isn't a full on action movie when the ball starts rolling it really makes up for it. I feel like no matter how much i write i could never sum up this film in full i had to see it twice! and it only got better with time. Heath has to win an Oscar for this and to be honest this film deserves a few in other areas. And watch out for the ending! wow even had people in tears throughout the cinema has got to be one of the most powerful endings ever. For me the best thing about the film was the story itself pure genius the concepts and ideas and some of the most memorable and well thought out lines and scenes ever. This film appeals in my opinion to anyone and everyone from young children all the way upto older folks and you don't necessarily have to be a big batman fan to enjoy this gem. Watch out with the kids though as this a very dark film and has scenes and ideas which may frighten younger children *****"
7545,True,"This was the best batman movie of the whole batman history! I enjoy a lot the action sequences (which started from the beginning) The visual effects were nice, and the plot was well-prepared. Really a nice and enjoyable film. It's the best Christopher Nolan's movie. I consider this batman film as a masterpiece. But besides the writing, the directing, Christian Bale performance and all, what I enjoy, enjoy full, the most was the incredible and amazing performance of Heath Ledger as the Joker. It was simply amazing the way he developed the character and the way he, I don't know, but in every scene of the movie that he show I enjoy that scene a lot, so basically that was for me the whole movie. The way he speaks, with his hilarious laugths and all. But what I like it, whats that the Nolan brothers make a wonderful script for every character, but specially for the Joker. For closing up, this movie is until now, the best movie of the year and of the batman series, definitely."
7546,True,"Contradictory to endless super-hyped big budgets films with fancy trailers, this one delivers the goods promised. I have been following this film ever since Lt. Gordon pulled out that fateful card at the end of a brilliant ""Batman Begins"". Following this trail has been a 3 year affair and as a die hard Batman Fan(atic), I was actually more nervous than excited at the prospect of finally seeing this film. On hand I knew that Christopher Nolan and ""Cast & Crew"" wouldn't really muck it up but on the other, it takes one greedy studio executive with an ego to decide the fate of the product deliveredthankfully, that was not the case!! From the 1st trailer to the 2nd to the 3rd, the prospect of this film making history becomes more and more apparent. As for the marketing, to have one half of perfectly sane people paint their faces and parade around town in the guise of lunacy coupled with the other half campaigning in their city's for a non existent District Attorney is nothing short of PURE GENIUS! The Viral Campaign (which I followed closely too) made the film all the more intriguing and by the time 18th July '08 came, a final question was still lingering in my mind: Would The Dark Knight live up to the Hype? To my luck and too my wishes, The Dark Knight Crushed! The film-making was Grade ""A"", the story (which filmmakers have a tendency to go overboard with sequels) was the finest balance that could have been struck between comic and film, the actors were nothing short of amazing and most importantly the product on the whole delivered 100% 30 seconds (literally) into the movie, I knew I was in for the ride of my life and by the end credits, I was ready to go on this ride for the second time. Heath Ledger's Joker shone, just as Christian Bale's Batman did in Batman Begins (and in The Dark Knight for that matter) There are no words that can fully express the magnitude of his performance, but I will say this in a staunchly heterosexual way: ""I couldn't get my eyes off The Joker."" Aaron Eckhart was superb in portraying Harvey Dent's tragic struggle with duality. The physical scarring looks Dead On! (no pink paint this time round thankfully) Maggie Gyllenhaal made a much better Rachael Dawes the Katie Holmes, probably comes largely from the fact that the character itself is not superfluous like she was in the last one. Michael Caine & Morgan Freeman do tend to make anything look good and this was no exception .A special thanks to Gary Oldman for giving me The Commissioner I've always wanted to see done right. Watching him play Gordan page for page is nothing short of raw pleasure. To the filmmakers, rather than merely supporting their film to the hilt (which I am as you can see) I really would like to genuinely thank Christopher Nolan and Crew for giving me 2 of the greatest films I've seen and for literally bringing Batman's Universe to life. I've seen it 4 times already and am definitely going for 5. There is no guessing how many stars I'm giving this oneI just wish I could give it 11. (or more)"
7547,True,"Very rarely can you have a movie where everything works together perfectly, but this movie just clicks on every level. The first half of the movie is very much in the style of Batman Begins, giving us only what information is necessary, and keeping a fast pace. Since we've already been introduced to WHY Batman exists, we get to see Bale go through the emotions of SHOULD Batman continue to exist, and at what cost. Then, when you think things are winding down, and is seems like Batman has won, the third act begins. This is where The Joker vs. Batman really hits its high point, as both sides continually raise the bar, and the characters really have a lot to loose. It's an emotional roller-coaster as you're never sure who's going to come out ahead (much like The Prestige).Christian Bale returns as Bruce Wayne, and proves again why he's beloved by so many. Bale is able to flawlessly pull off a charming billionaire, while still harboring a darker thirst for justice. As Batman, Bale demonstrates that a man in a bat suit CAN be serious, both about himself and his attire.Aaron Eckhart brings confidence to the screen as ""The White Knight"" Harvey Dent. As the hero without a mask, Dent is able to do what Batman cannot fight injustice outside the shadows of the night. Eckhart's transformation into Two-Face is seamless, as we can literally and metaphorically still see half of Dent. His performance is a study into insanity, proving that even the best of us can fall. My only regret here is that Two-Face had such a short life, and we won't be seeing him in the next installment.The real star here though is Heath Ledger. Before DK, nobody would have ever guessed Ledger would have been able to pull off insanity so well. From the very beginning, The Joker is sinister and disturbingly comical, without stepping on the toes of Jack Nicholson. His makeup and way he carries himself are metaphors for his personality, and his monologues with Batman especially are bone-chilling and powerful. This movie will surely go down as his greatest work, and will leave a legacy for Ledger that will live forever. My one problem is that we never got closure with The Joker. (Maybe at the Ledger family's request?) Director/Writer Christopher Nolan definitely succeeded on multiple levels. There was powerful danger from many directions, making every scene tension filled and nerve-racking. The action was spot on, using stunts and pyrotechnics instead of resorting to CGI. The hospital scene especially was magnificent. As a filmmaker, I know how precise and tedious it must have been to prepare something that needed to be done right on the first take. The characters were all complex, and all had a lot at stake, which is rare for a ""silly"" superhero movie. Both Jonathan and Christopher Nolan did a phenomenal job writing the dialogue, as every character said a lot through little words, and all had motivated intentions that felt like their choices were very real.Because Nolan had already proved himself both as a Writer and Director within the Batman franchise, he was able to take the risks necessary to pull off something groundbreaking. Nolan proves that audiences will support 152 minute blockbuster when it's more complex drama than action as long as there's real talent on-screen. Comic fans and American audiences finally get the superhero movie (and the sequel) they deserve, and the numbers will continue to prove it."
7548,True,"First, Batman is my favourite comic's character. Second, Batman Begins was excellent. Third, the Dark Knight is a masterpiece... As I watched the film, I tried to think of a word to summarize it. ""Chaos"" came into my mind. This film is pure chaos, as Joker would love it. Full of twists and action and a philosophical view at the fight between good/evil and order/chaos, the Dark Knight will leave you much entertained throughout 2:45 hrs. Batman Begins focus on Bruce Wayne/Batman, but this film focus not on any particular character but in Gotham City. It focus on the struggle of its soul, its identity. On one hand, you have Batman, Lieutenant Jim Gordon, Rachel Dawes and the DA Harvey Dent all trying to fight crime and to put Gotham on a good path. On the other hand you have mainly the Joker, wreaking havoc and trying to make the city itself to descend into anarchy for he believes not in order but in chaos. Speaking of the Joker, Heath Ledger really gave a performance to be remembered. The voice and the all his twitches made the character simply menacing and that's what it was aiming for. A complete psychopath with no regards to any plan, schedule, law or moral. As in the words of Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine) ""Some men just want to watch the world burn."" It is a perfect villain. Also Aaron Eckhart was excellent. The rise of Harvey Dent and the fall into Two-Face is very well done and Mr. Eckhart ends up brilliantly playing a man whose grief turned into complete madness washing away every good thing about Harvey Dent. The rest of the cast has improved from the last film (which I thought it would be too damn difficult) with Christian Bale showing very well the struggle inside Batman between doing what is right and what is necessary, with Gary Oldman and his character having a more pro eminent place than in Begins and kudos to Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman for doing their small but important part. Also, I believe that Maggie Gyllenhaal was an improvement to Katie Holmes but still not enough. Summarizing, the film is, well, a chaotic organized masterpiece. Thanks to all the crew, especially to Mr. Nolan, for delivering us one of the best film I've ever seen."
7549,True,"The story starts off with a bank robbery organised by a man with a painted face and many scars to his smile. He goes by the name of the Joker. His accomplices are tricked into killing each other to share the prize money but the joker was secretly involved. The Joker is hired by a mob gang to make the Batman turn himself in or he kills one person every day. The Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon and the vocal hero who leaves his life by chance, Harvey Dent are going to have to stop the unstoppable man. The Joker will do what ever what ever it takes to kill them, but the twist to this superhero film is that that the heros and villains are realising that they are nothing without each other and keep having to spare one anothers lives causing many people to die. This is making batman believe he is the villain of Gotham city."
7550,True,"Okay. Let me start by saying that this film totally blew me away. I'm not going to say it was the best movie I have ever seen, but it certainly is one of them. The script was amazing and well thought out. There were simple little details in the writing that made the story fall together perfectly. I adored the introduction of Two-Face. It didn't dawn on me at all until I saw Harvey beating up the mental patient. Very nice, very nice. I definitely thought the film was going to end with The Joker blowing up the hospital, setting up the film for a sequel, but I am quite glad it continued from there.The best part of the film was definitely Heath Ledger's little monologue about his mother and his father and his scars. I don't think I was ever so mesmerized by a monologue as much as that one. Heath had me captivated. His screen presence, his characterization...the little nervous twitch. He truly deserves all the praise he is getting for this film.Moving on, I loved the twist of faking Gordon's death, although I must admit when I saw him for I thought was dead I felt very betrayed. There are certain characters who I feel are untouchable and Gordon is one of them, so I'm glad he lived or I would have been a teensy bit upset.It was a perfect idea to show the Joker as a man with nothing to lose and a man with nothing to gain. How do you beat someone with absolutely nothing? You can't, which is why I was terrified of The Joker.I also liked the scene with the two boats. It was genius and it actually gave me some hope in humankind. You know, when it comes down to it, most people are decent people and I think the writer's message was clear. We have to give people a chance, we have to keep our faith in mankind, or else we have nothing to hold on to. Forgive me if that sounds cheesy, but I think it's true.Okay, now my one complaint about this movie...drum roll please. It was Batman's voice. I love Christian Bale and I thought he was fantastic as both Batman and Wayne. He plays the brooding hero very well. But in all honesty, hearing Batman's voice was really annoying. Thankfully, that fact that Bruce disguises his voice makes sense and therefore makes this annoyance acceptable, even if it is slightly.Overall, loved the film. Although, the word love barely scratches the surface of what I thought."
7551,True,"When the amazing Chris Nolan took the helm of the Batman Begins - my instincts said that he would do something different. And he didn't disappoint. In the second installment from Nolan - you can sense genuine agony and doubt in the caped crusader. He realizes that how difficult his job is and that he is not infallible, especially when he comes face to face with an equally powerful (not in strength - but in conviction) enemy who lies squarely on the other end of the morality scale.Anyone familiar with the history of Batman comics - will know that amongst all the Batman villains - it is the Joker who brings out the best (and the worst) in Batman. To draw another cinematic reference - as Samuel Jackson's Elijah mentions in the movie ""Unbreakable"" - each superhero has his arch enemy amongst other enemies. This arch enemy is typically very similar to the superhero - just believes in causes which are diametrically opposite to the beliefs of the superhero. (Another example - Superman & Lex Luthor) So what typically happens in the conflict between the Superhero and his arch enemy is that against the backdrop of the larger fight between ""Good"" and ""Evil"" - the mental and physical (in that order) conflict between the hero and the villain takes centerstage. It becomes personal. Both see their reflections in the other...to the point that the existence of one, hangs on the existence of the other. Chris Nolan handles this complex relationship between Batman and his arch enemy with considerable insight and for the lack of a better term - tenderness. But that's not what makes the movie work so well. It is Heath Ledger's interpretation of the Joker - and what the character stands for - that shocks, provokes and gives an entire new meaning to the on-screen villain.The Joker is essentially an anarchist. He has no specific objective (""I am like a dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do, if I caught one""). He just feels that with the coming of Batman, Harvey Dent and Jim Gordon - the balance between good and evil is getting lopsided. He feels there needs to be ""a new class of criminal"" - to create destruction for the sake of it. He is anti-thesis, anti-gravity and anti-establishment - all rolled into one. He represents the other side...and actually believes his existence is necessary for the existence of the regular or ""good"" side. He dislikes the scheming plotting planning nature of ""socially acceptable"" humans - as he sees no ""grand"" plan in how the world unfolds around him. He believes that the Sun is there to burn...not warm. He believes that evil should exist in the world without purpose - and hates so called criminals with monetary objectives. He does doesn't mind if people call him a freak - in fact he revels in that. He believes that there is a Joker hidden inside every human being...and he wants to bring that side out. Most of all...he is crystal clear about his purpose and role in the world. (How many of us can say that? ;)) Don't mistake the joker as unhinged. He probably is the only one not.And all this is magnified when projected from behind the ultimate mask of duality. The face of a clown. Good when there is evil. Laughter where there is pain. Heath Ledger's portrayal of Joker is nothing short of terrifying. To me he makes Alien Vs. Predator look like a kindergarten costume party. And this is partly because he makes it look so frighteningly real. But what he also does is that he defies our instinct for rationalizing everything we see. When we see a real life villain like Osama Bin Laden fly planes into our buildings - we rationalize, cook up conspiracies, wage wars. Because there is a ""reason"" why someone would do this...right? The Joker defies reason. And that is the most unsettling bit about Heath Ledger's character.Batman had given himself the purpose of clean Gotham's streets. But if you dig deeper into the character - he still feels that he is ""forcefully"" rationalizing his existence - by juxtaposing it with these cheap criminals. ""I have to do good things - because I have to give the citizens of Gotham a better life."" With the joker - he realizes (as you see in the end of the movie) that he doesn't have to ""appear"" good and that appearances are just that. Appearances. He realizes when he comes face to face with his arch enemy and the broken hero ""Two Face/Harvey Dent"" - that he exists because a character like the Joker exists. He attains the same amount of clarity of purpose and role - that the Joker has. And that's what makes Batman complete. It is the Joker who makes Batman believe in himself and his purpose.One of my favorite Joker dialogues is when he hisses, ""You make me complete."" I now realize that he was speaking for both of them.I hope all of you have watched this movie - if not, I hope you watch it. And not just for the special effects."
7552,True,"Ol' Jack's Joker was dark, creepy, funny, and disturbing. A far cry from Cesar Romero. He was cinema's best Clown Prince of Crime. But Ledger's Joker surpasses him in every single way. He's scarier, more disturbing, has more humor, and even more memorable quotes. Sorry Jack, but to quote Prince from Batman '89 ""there's a new prince in town.""Ledger basically steals the movie. Every scene he's in is exciting and perfectly made. I once found myself wanting Joker to pop up just because he was always so good. He's so good that you never even think of Ledger as you watch him. You never think of Brokeback Mountain, A Knight's Tale, or the guy who unfortunately died. You only see the psychotic maniac from the comics. It's such a shame that Ledger died thus eliminating Joker from any other sequel, unless they recast which would be quite controversial and not the same.The story is engaging. Largely based of The Long Halloween, except that Joker is pretty much the only freak villain. That's my personal favorite graphic novel and I loved how they adapted it. I liked seeing a villain before he became a villain so you can get to know and feel sorry for him. I only wish that we saw more of Dent before he got scarred.Fanboys certainly will love it. Nolan brings a seriousness to the movie. It all feels like it could happen if someone just went out and did it. Personally, I still love the Burton films. They're both equally good in different ways.As good as the movie is, it's not perfect. It does have it's problems. It does seem like the movie is about half an hour too long. Some things could have been simplified or streamlined. It has that The Lost World problem where it reaches a couple points that are like an ending but keeps going.One problem I had with this, and Batman Begins, was the lack of memorable music. Elfman had such a classic score that I can hum the tune months after not watching the movie or listening to the soundtrack. But I watched the movie today, and listened to the soundtrack on the way, but I can barely remember any specific song. The music is good, don't get me wrong. I like listening to it and it sets the mood. But it's like whipped cream. Good and adds flavor but nothing substantial.Joker monologues at the end. Didn't they watch The Incredibles where Syndrome talks about villains who monologue? It's one of those things that's been parodied so much that it seems silly when it does happen.I don't care for Two-Face's motivation at the end. The Long Halloween handled him so much better. The movie, he's out for personal revenge. While in TLH he was finishing the quest. The whole novel Dent's trying to take down Falcone and once he's Two-Face he just does it without the law. It was like he was a twisted version of Batman, doing what needed to be done but not necessarily in a good way. I love the idea that Two-Face is an evil version of Batman. But this movie he was just evil. And I certainly don't like that he allowed himself to be manipulated by Joker, that Two-Face did what he said to. Two-Face should do these things out of his own twisted sense of justice, not because a psychopath said to introduce anarchy.The Bat-Sonar seemed too fantastic an idea. Hooking up every single cell phone in the city to make a sonic map of everything? I can see listening in on every phone to find the Joker but using it to see just disconnected me from the reality of the movie too much. And it looked like it was out of a Wachowski Brother's movie, confusing to look at.Overall this is a must see film for any Batman fan, comic book reader, or even a casual film fan. It's fun, exciting, and every minute is entertaining. It's nice to see that audiences are taking movies like The Dark Knight and Iron Man seriously, and not just viewing it as guys in spandex fighting other guys in spandex. I wouldn't call it the best movie ever. And I can't clearly say it's the best Batman movie (Burton had a certain quirkiness). But it's better than 95% of the films being made. This movie is going to be remembered for decades to come."
7553,True,"It's not too often that a movie surpasses the hype that it has brought before its screening. Just look at Spider-man 3... Nolan's THE DARK KNIGHT goes over and beyond what I expected.Nearly every aspect of the movie is perfect. The casting, the acting, the cinematography, the CGI (the little that there is)...ALL PERFECTION. This is definitely that jewel of Nolan's career, and may always be (until the next one comes and could possibly be on par with it).Christian Bale has definitely secured his place as the best Batman and Bruce Wayne ever on film. He plays the separation of the personas so well, and also plays their similarities flawlessly. Gyllenhaal does the worst acting job in the movie, and she is still pretty good...just shows how amazing everyone else did. Eckhart does a phenomenal job as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, making Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal seem like the lamest piece of acting ever.Now to the man that hyped the film more than anything...Mr. Ledger. His portrayal as the Clown Prince of Crime is truly something special, and hands-down one of the greatest pieces of acting in film history. Heath Ledger was not in this movie...the Joker was. Every time he got on screen he stole the scene, and a chill would run up my spine. It's too sad that we can't have an encore performance.Overall, the movie is so much more than the classic Batman vs. Villain. It shows how the Joker gets deep into the mind of the Caped Crusader, making him question his own existence, and stumble on the line of what his perception of justice is. Everything that Batman stands for, the Joker is out to prove wrong. That's what makes him the arch-nemesis. And Ledger portrays this persona so flawlessly it's almost inhuman.This is probably my favorite movie of all-time now, with the Godfather in a close second. Can't wait for the next installment...heard it's the Riddler :)"
7554,True,"People thought that even after Begins that The Batman franchise couldn't be pushed any further well this exceeds all the other Batman films and the Hero genre and its franchises for that matter. Burtons work was visually stunning with a good list of actors, however it lacked the realism down to earth sensibilities and intensity that Christopher Nolan's film offers. Characters with versatile down to earth characteristics that all feel unsatisfied with the situations around them either from an protagonist or antagonistic perspective. Most of the characters come from the perspective of hope for the City of Gotham to become a safer more accessible place.Christian Bale reprises his role as a fully formed Batman who hopes to retire his alter-ego. To do this he has hopes in a hero without a mask that of Aaron Eckhart Harvey Dent. Who is a supposedly fearless and incorruptible man who is cleaning up the Gotham city in ways its never seen in a long time. That is until Heath Ledgers legendary role as fully formed non-compassionate emotionless psychopathic purely evil brutal Joker. In the past the joker has been depicted as a villainous notorious social pariah with a sense of sanity. This Joker is someone who has no ambitious goal just wanting to commit chaos. His presence provides a sense of dark humor that the audience can enjoy through how he manipulates and takes control of everything.This film is a portrayal of depicting a good vs. evil scenario similar to J.R. Tolkens idea in Lord of The Rings. This film has a thick plot dark presence like Batman should truly be, not some Comic Book cliché that appeals to children like Joel Schumachers work, but something with deep material and believable characters. I think this film is one of the best films of the decade and will probably be nominated if not than the Oscars are ignoring one of Hollywoods biggest film powerhouses."
7555,True,"The Dark Knight is a great film, one of the best superhero film ever made. Batman is my second favourite comic book series, only beaten by X-Men in my opinion. This film has everything to appease Batman fans, and the general cinema going public.The Dark Knight starts showing the Joker and his gang robbing a mob bank and becoming a treat to them. A police team, led by Lt. Gordon (Gary Oldman), also plan on taking on the mob by affecting their wallets. A Chinese Gangster, Lau, offers to safeguard the mob's money and this is when the Joker offers his services to them. Batman (Christian Bale) and Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) also are involved in the operation and Batman goes to Hong Kong to receive Lau and bring him back to Hong Kong. Because of Lau's information the Gotham authorities are able to move on the mob. This is when Joker the shows his true colours and starts his murderous rampage around Gotham. As the Joker continues Bruce Wanye starts to doubt himself, he hoped that Dent would take his place as the hope of Gotham. This changes when the Joker's men capture him and he becomes scared for life. This makes him into Two-Face, a psychopathic killer who ends up having a personal mission against the mob, the police and Batman.The Dark Knight starts off where Batman Begins left off. It is even darker then before and is easily the best Batman film so far. Christopher Nolan understands Batman, knowing that he is a dark character, and not some light-hearted camp affair like the 60s show and Joel Schumacher. Like Batman Begins, The Dark Knight is influenced by Frank Miller's Batman: Year One and The Dark Knight Returns and Alan Moore's The Killing Joke. The Dark Knight brings into two of the best villains in the franchise: the Joker and Two-Face. Heath Ledger got the Joker right, as a psychopath who has no remorse. The Joker is not a camp character, who has dark humour and this is how he is meant to be. I was personally return impress with Two-Face and he looked horrible (in a good way). I really enjoyed Eckhart's performance as Two-Face. Christian Bale and Gary Oldman are good, as always and Maggie Gyllenhaal is a better casting choice then Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are also good in there roles as Alfred and Lucius Fox.The Dark Knight is more action packed then its precedence, but still has its eyes on the prize. This is an intelligence thriller, looking at philosophies of ideas and threats the film as a crime thriller. Unlike previous Batman films which focused too much on the villains, Batman is still the central focus of the film and Bruce Wayne himself is made into an interesting character. There is also a sub-plot which is the love triangle between Bruce, Harvey and Rachel. The action in the film is very good, and like a good Bond film, uses as little CGI as possible.I would like to the Joker and Two-Face in future Batman films, especially if they are directed by Christopher Nolan or a director of the same calibre. If they don't come back I would go for Catwoman or the Penguin (as the gentleman of crime). I love that Christopher Nolan takes the most realistic approach as possible.My one word of warning is that this is not a kids film and would be close to a 15/R rating. This film is very dark and no one should bring kids younger then 10-years-old."
7556,True,"Many Comic books characters that become mainstream movies usually only appeal to fans of comic book films (which is not really a large audience). However, Batman, the dark knight is very good for comic book film novices for two very good reasons. 1: You don't have you read comic books to get the basic premise of the film. 2: Unlike most sequels, you don't need to see the first film for this film to make sense! The acting is pretty flawless, Heath Ledger especially (rest in peace), there are many people whom say that Heath Legder made the film and is owed a lot of credit, including his fellow co-actors / actress, they are right, Heath Legder's performance was truly unique, he gave the joker character his much needed satire and menace, which has lacking from the first Batman film with Jack Nicholson! Batman the dark knight is a fantastic blend of global acting talent, an excellent script and plot, wonderful special effects and it lasts a decent amount of time ( 2 hours and 30 minutes roughly) The die-hard batman fans have pointed out there are some continually errors, but the film is that good to watch, you can easily ignore them or not notice them at all, like I did! For fans, this film is a treat, for non-fans, the film is very good, highly enjoyable, not quite what you'll be expecting but it is nice to see something different occasionally, it's no mistake that Batman : The dark knight is top of the all time IMDb film chart, it's there for a reason!"
7557,True,"I have never seen a batman movie before and never read a batman comic.This time I went to see the movie,just for time pass and what I felt while watching the movie was that Is this the best movie ever made? It was almost flawless with nothing to complain about and everything to praise for. By far Christian Bale is the most amazing Batman ever. As Bruce Wayne, he is smart and handsome. When he plays the character Bruce Wayne,he don't try to express himself too much and when he is Batman,he is a superhero that the town Gotham needs.Evrywhere he has fully justified his character, like his complex relationship with Rachel. Harvey Dent was also a superhero in this movie without even wearing a mask.He was being compared with the batman. He did everything perfect. When he gave up himself as Batman just to save the real batman and because he developed a trust between him and the batman. Rachel played quite beautifully, who was in between two relationship.But she chose the one she knew would be right. Now the Joker character played by Late Heath Ledger cannot be described in words.Just every time he was coming on the screen we were wondering whats next?? The movie was more than 2 hrs..but I never wanted it to end..It was unpredictable, and the tension from the screen was spreading across the theater."
7558,True,"1939 - Bob Kane creates Batman. Batman makes his first appearance on a Detective Comics issue in June 1939. This is one of the earliest forms of modern dark entertainment.1943 & 1949 - Batman makes his first film appearance in theatrical serials . This would later provide the basis for what was coming in the 60s.1966 - The infamous campy TV show starring Adam West and Burt Ward hits the airwaves. The show generates such Batman classics as Bat Shark Repellant and Anti-Penguin Spray, the cartoon BAM's, POW's, and OOF's, Robin saying ""Holy nightmare, Holy hijinx,"" and other Holy you-make-up-your-owns, the 60s Batmobile, the To the Batcave's or To the Batmobile's, the Bat transition, dutch angle shots, and more. It was from this show that the Riddler became a classic Batman villain.1987 - Batman: Year Zero is published, bringing Batman back into the dark tone that he rightfully belonged in.1989 - Tim Burton taps into the comics for a film adaptation. Despite many plot holes and inconveniences, the film won an award for outstanding visual design.1992 - Tim Burton releases Batman Returns, which was one of the few sequels that improved over the original. It was here that Tim Burton handed the reins to Joel Schumacher, who would take the franchise to a downhill turn.1995 - Joel Schumacher releases Batman Forever, which gave the franchise a campy twist and one of the most infamous objects in film history: nipples on the Batsuit. Despite the campiness, it was received well by moviegoers but not fans of the comics.1997 - Joel Schumacher releases the infamous Batman and Robin, which nearly killed the franchise and pretty much killed the careers of all who were involved (except George Clooney and Uma Thurman). The film had everything from butt shots and silly Bat toys (Bat credit cards, anyone?) to ridiculous action sequences and bad dialogue (ice puns and plant puns.) 2005 - Christopher Nolan resurrects the franchise with his well-received Batman Begins. Considering our current subject, this was just a test to see what Chistopher Nolan could do with the Caped Crusader.2008  The Dark Knight wows and amazes audiences the world over and earns its rightful place in the IMDb's Top 250 Movies.It's official!! Batman has been wowing and amazing audiences the world over ever since his first appearance in a comic book 70 years ago. There are some people that think that the Christopher Nolan Batman films are horrible, but they should just bear one thing in mind. Batman was and always will be a dark sort of superhero in a dark sort of tone, which was how Bob Kane probably created him. The 60's TV show was just a spoof, and to tell you the truth, it worked out well. Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne, fights crime just for the sole reason that his parents were murdered by a criminal when he was a kid, which makes the character of Batman more interesting. Now onto the movie: The Dark Knight is the masterpiece of all comic book films. Christopher Nolan takes acting and comic book adaptations (soon to be an iconic highlight to the decade of the 00's) to the next level. Every piece of footage is put together excellently. The dialogue is just fresh and ripe. I'm autistic and an introvert and have a hard time socializing, but the actors make it look easy. Where the heck did Jonathan and Christopher Nolan learn to write? I would like to know because I want to be a movie maker, too. The acting here is just awesome. Christian Bale uses a regular voice for Bruce Wayne and a dark, bad sounding voice for Batman. To me, any actor or actress who can play many types of people (i.e. Dustin Hoffman) is a great actor or actress. Michael Caine gives a spot on performance as Alfred (I say spot on because he's British.) The movie does very well without Katie Holmes as Rachael Dawes, as here she is played by a different actress, Maggie Gyllenhaal. I still don't understand why Rachael died in the movie. Maybe it was to develop the character of Two-Face. Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Aaron Eckhart do great as well. Heath Ledger, however, tops them all. His performance as the Joker is the best I have ever seen on the character. This also make Jack Nicholson's Joker look like a petty crook. Although he is dead and no longer on this planet, he will definitely win an Oscar for Best Actor. I wonder where he learned how to act. There is also a shot where a lot of cars are stalled in the city streets and people crammed together like packs of Coke. How does Christopher Nolan make such a scene happen. Does he wait for the biggest car jam in history? Beats me. There is only one problem in this movie. Considering that the Joker didn't die in the movie, and that Heath Ledger is dead, it makes me wonder if the sequel to this movie will be ""Battlefield Earth"" awful. In the meantime, lots of hugs and kisses to Christopher Nolan and everyone who worked on Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. They deserve special love and caring because as long as the franchise remains in their hands, we'll get probably one of the greatest franchises ever. Batman, if there is anything I should say about this moment, then Welcome Home, Batman. Welcome Home."
7559,True,"As far as action movies go, Dark Knight was as intense and good as action movies can get. The acting was superb- Ledger became the standard by which future movie villains will be judged. He was not the ""cartoon"" Joker, but a very creepy, almost Hannibal Lector-like character. My wife actually had a nightmare about him the night after we saw the movie. It was Ledger's performance that really cemented this as a great film, but also the reason for caution. Batman is based off a comic book and so Hollywood, though giving it a PG-13 rating should expect that kids will go because it is based on a comic book/cartoon character. I cannot emphasize strongly enough- DO NOT TAKE A CHILD TO THIS MOVIE!!! Ledger's brilliant intensity and profound evil made for a good villain...a very ADULT villain wholly unsuitable for kids. That coupled with the amount and intensity of brutal violence in this film...it shocks me that it only earned a PG-13. I cannot comprehend how it did not get an R rating. I do not say that as an insult to the film, just stating a fact. Truth is, it was a brilliantly done action film....FOR ADULTS. Batman was high octane and fast paced....quickest 2.5 hours I ever spent. Thoroughly enjoyed it, just keep the kiddies away from this one."
7560,True,"The Dark Knight was a different kind of movie experience for me. It was intelligent, confusing, long, and raised some concerns.First off, it was intelligent because the movie's story line was very intricate. This is one movie you have to pay constant attention to since it felt like it lasted forever, (157mins actually). But that is not to say that the movie was boring. It contained many twists, turns, and misdirections  too many for the average movie adaptation genre - that halfway through the The Dark Knight's twists one would think it would have to be the climax soon. From hindsight, it seems fortunate now that I watched the movie alone, otherwise, I would not have enjoyed the fullness of the movie.What really was intelligent about the film was The Joker. He was the perfect schemer. He was amoral, dark, and (dare I say) disturbed. In the film, he toyed with Gotham City and it's caped crusader at the palm of his hands. Everything fell into place as he planned. Eventually, things came to an end when the ""unstoppable force"" met the ""immovable object"" (think Matrix's paradox in terms of the story line, not in terms of visual experience). The Joker was really good at his craft. The opening heist was a foretaste of things to come.If the movie ended from the point of view of The Joker, this film could have been about The Joker. The title could have been something like ""The Made-up Menace"". Seriously, The Joker felt overpowering in the story, and the Batman was just being the Batman.I could say that I am a casual Batman fan, having caught all the movies since 1989 (Batman (1989), Batman Returns (1992), Batman Forever (1995), Batman & Robin (1997)), the first animated series after that (Batman: The Animated Series (1992-1997)), the animated movie (Batman: Mask of the Phantasm (1993)), Batman Begins (2005), and this one. From ""Batman"", the franchise developed its movies to become gradually more colorful than the other, culminating with ""Batman & Robin"" where the villains and (alas) the heroes were at their most colorful (from icy bluish white with Mr. Freeze, to bright green and flaming pink with Poison Ivy, and Batman, Robin, Bat Girl with every color in between!) Colorful accident aside, Batman and Robin gave the franchise a Power-Rangers feel but The Dark Knight changed all that. The Dark Knight presented a more ""real"" Gotham, real characters, and most importantly a real story.What was confusing, taking all the movies of Batman together, was how to string the stories together. Understandable, Batman Begins presented the genesis of Batman, but how does one put The Dark Knight vis-a-vis Batman? Parallel universes? Painfully real (The Dark Knight) and the naively goofy (Batman)? Overall, the movie is not one for all fans. Keep the kids away. I was having the urge to discourage parents (mostly male, who were perhaps Batman fans like me) initiating their children to their favorite hero. The movie experience might be to dark and heavy to handle for the fragile minds of the young ones).The movie is not for all ages, but a brilliant choice for those who can. Just remember to pay attention."
7561,True,"This is what film making truly is! Christopher Nolan has taken the comic book story and turned this film into a complete masterpiece. The Dark Knight is intense, dynamic, and a truly beautiful film. Much like Batman Begins, the story is honest, and the audience believes it. The film is darker, we see the characters inside and out-and as we try and make sense of their actions so does Batman,but it only leads him to question himself and his purpose....thus the battle begins, the external battle of good vs. evil, and the internal battle, one in which Batman is struggling with throughout the film. ""You can either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become a villain,"" a line passed on to Batman from Harvey Dent...as Batman tries to make sense of this, Gotham City is being swallowed whole by crime, led singlehandedly by The Joker.Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker is historic. WOW. Phenomenal, amazing, terrifying, SICK, The Joker is all of this tied in to one(and so much more) The Joker haunts you, you fear The Joker...all while remaining completely in awe of what this man has done with his character. His makeup smeared, his laugh alarming- he is homicidal, enthralling,RUTHLESS, and why? The Joker makes it clear throughout the film that he is not your common criminal, he wreaks havoc simply because he can, and he will. He is in every sense of the word-evil, and yet he doesn't see himself that way..The Joker has his own point of view,and methods. If Heath Ledger does not earn an academy award nomination I don't know what I'd do, his portrayal of The Joker blew me away, I have never seen such a performance!! It left me speechless.All aspects of this film if not considered to be perfection were the closest i've ever seen to it. The cinematography is just as breathtaking as in Batman Begins. The musical scores...POWERFUL, while you're sitting there wide eyed, heart pounding as if you've just run a race, the scores give you goosebumps, they consume you with their ability to enhance your emotions, and are just beautiful, captivating...beautifully captivating! The action sequences....GRIPPING! Wow.Costume design- inspiring.Cast - superb.This is what film making is. This is what every film maker should aspire to do. GO SEE THIS FILM!! Every aspect of this film was perfect..."
7562,True,"I went to Dark Knight expecting the worst. I had read on this site that this film was overwhelmingly dark, negative and depressing. Many reviewers acted like they liked the film because it is so dark and pessimistic. I personally don't like dark films. I loved Journey to the Center of the Earth and rank that as the best film of this year as well as a Chinese orphan film and the under rated Kit Kitredge. But II hate pointless and depressing stuff like The Sopranos and I never liked The Godfather series because they were boring and dark with dead horses being major moments. Its true that Dark Knight has been ranked higher than The Godfather, Citizen Cane and Apocalypse Now. But those films were terribly over rated. You want great mobster films than check out Cagney's White Heat or Angels with Dirty faces or Humphrey Bogart's great gangster films not modern soap opera mobster films like Bugsy.This Dark Knight was hyped to be gory and grim so I almost did not go. The first 30 minutes of the film did have some gratuitous violence and I would have cut a few of the Joker's violent attacks but the film survives that. The great film Rambo is far more gory. The beginning of the film seems more like a mobster and crime film than an action film but that is OK. But then the film seemed to build. In my opinion this is not a film about flawed heroes or that good and evil does not exist.It is really a film that is about Batman against the Joker. The joker is truly evil. The film has very little psycho babble. At first the Joker explains that his evil father is why he grew up to be evil. But later we see that the Joker is a chronic liar with a different lie about his ex-wife and cannot be analyzed. The Joker's past is not important. The Joker (also called the clown) exists to destroy the world. He also exists to change good people into bad people. Everyone has encountered the kind of people who want to change you in real life. Each one of us has had to deal with people like the Joker.But who will go bad. Will Batman go bad? Who will go bad? Remember Anakin went bad in Star Wars. This film is essentially about endurance against evil. The acting in this film is excellent. The supporting roles with Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are excellent. These are the two finest character actors of out time. Michael Caine has been around a long time dating back to his early films: The Ipcress File and No Time for Heroes. The other actors did fine. The female lead was fine and not as bad as some reviewers say. Ledger did a great job as the Joker. At times he seemed like the insane Jack Nicholson in the Shining and even Harpo Marx. Batman himself did a fine job. The Batman series has been OK for me but not in my top movies. This Batman is far superior to the others.Batman and Bruce Wayne are both interesting characters and better than the wimpy Iron Man when he was not Iron Man. The special effects also work and the Bat Bike would work great in James Bond. The ending works but as some have mentioned the last few seconds could have been after the credits. This is a surprising Thumbs up for Batman, The Dark Knight. The person with me mentioned that the music from the Batman TV series should have been played. That would have been a good thing to put in the credits at the end. This is a surprising thumbs up for Batman, The Dark Knight putting it in my top five films of the year."
7563,True,"I must preface this by saying I am not a Batman super fan. I can't agree with those who think that everything Christopher Nolan touches is gold. Memento and Batman Begins were great films, but I despised Insomnia and the Prestige was just okay. To his credit however his movies always feature some great acting performances. The first thing that must be mentioned when discussing The Dark Knight is Heath Ledger as The Joker. In my eyes, this is hands down the best villain I have ever seen on film. He is every bit deserving of any attention and accolades received from this role, and only now do I see the potential lost by his passing. That said, the next most interesting thing about this film was Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent. While the motives and plausibility of the transition from Dent to Two-Face were questionable at best; the anticipation and dread derived from knowing that this noble and just character would transform into such a monster was one of the more interesting aspects of the movie. I enjoyed the dark tone of the movie overall. It was suspenseful, impeccably acted, thought provoking and immensely entertaining. There is just one flaw as far as I'm concerned...the final 15 minutes of the movie just doesn't do it for me.****MINOR SPOILER ALERT***** The Joker is such an evil character that I couldn't help but to root for his demise in a gruesome and climactic manner. The last shot we see of the Joker is him dangling from a rooftop. I feel like the audience deserved a better, more precise resolution. Perhaps knowing that we won't get the chance to see Ledger reprise this role was instrumental in my disappointment. Conversely, I was upset to see the Two-Face character dispensed with so quickly, but it did fit in well with the story I suppose.Lastly, I like the concept of Batman as a fugitive, but the idea that it was necessary for this to happen, and the reasoning used to justify him framing himself was...well stupid.Overall, these are not that important to the grand experience, as in the end the acting was what really made this movie stand out. I just can't help feeling a little cheated by the ending."
7564,True,"I was a little bit hesitant about Ledger being the joker, but he pulled through, and far better than I expected. You've probably heard it before, and you'll hear it more about Ledgers terrific performance. At first I thought it was just a tribute to his death (or should I say, ""his life) and to promote the movie, but his performance was one of the best I've seen in a long time.As much as I loved ""Batman Begins,"" I must admit this movie was better. But the first had some aspects that could've made this movie greater such as more detail and focus on Bruce Wayne's personal and history that made you love him and root for the hero, not just looking forward to see the villain. My friends and I found ourselves waiting for The scenes with the joker because those were the best and most interesting parts. I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing, but as I think about it I realize who the hero of the movie was and who the movie is supposed to really be about. Christian Bale is a terrific actor and the best choice to play Batman, but he didn't get a chance to shine in this movie because the movie stopped being about him and his life, but about saving Gotham (and of course the joker and twoface). Also, Alfred and Fox had a deeper depth in the original, in this movie the just seemed like they were there because they had to be or the story wouldn't be right. Basically what I'm saying is that the characters that mattered in the first movie lost that importance in this movie. But the depth of the joker, Harvey Dent (Twoface), and Gordon was there %100.The acting in this movie was outstanding, and the one that stood out the most, BESIDES HEATH LEDGER, was Aaron Eckhart. He did a great job as the good guy and the bad guy. When he was Harvey Dent he made you believe that he could really change the city and was a great guy who was willing to sacrifice for what he believed in. Then once Rachel dies, his whole attitude, train of thought, and beliefs change completely. This is when he becomes ""Twoface,"" and convinces you that he really changed. It was great because it felt bad to see him change because he was so believable and likable as the good guy, you hate to see him let the joker win and turn over to the bad side of the city.And now the reason for the title of my comment.This movie (at the moment) is rated a 9.6 and is #1 on the top 250 list. This is wrong in so may ways. It's hard for me to believe that ppl actually consider this movie better than ""Shawshank Redemption,"" ""Usual Suspects,"" ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Fight Club,"" and ""Goodfellas."" I don't think so. Which brings me to the title, IT WAS GOOD, ""BUT NOT THAT GOOD."""
7565,True,"PLOT: Picking up where 'Batman Begins' left off, Batman (Christian Bale) and James Gordon (Gary Oldman) join forces with Gotham's new DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), dubbed ""The White Knight"" by the press, to dismantle the remaining mob bosses in Gotham. But there's a new player in the game, a sadistic criminal called the Joker (the late Heath Ledger), and he's hellbent on destroying everyone and everything in his path, in one way or another.To put it simply, this is a powerful, moving film far beyond any previous comic book adaptations. The film truly is nothing short of superb. The late Heath Ledger was undeniably creepy & terrifying as the hateful, heartless, lip-licking, cackling Joker (and trust me, he does a great job of making you hate the Joker), while Aaron Eckhart delivers a powerful performance as the doomed DA Harvey Dent/2-Face, so powerful it makes me wish Eckhart was the one up for an Oscar nomination. Christian Bale is of course perfect as Batman/Bruce Wayne with the always welcomed Gary Oldman, Michael Caine & Morgan Freeman reprising their roles as Gordon, Alfred & Fox. Maggie Gyllenhaal lends nice support in the Rachel Dawes role originated by Katie Holmes (who is sadly better known now as Mrs. Tom Cruise #3).Can't wait for the next one... and it had better have Catwoman/Selina Kyle in it."
7566,True,"I can easily say that TDK is one of the best films of the decade, if not ever. It is so much more than a superhero movie, it is a true crime epic.All performances are amazing. Heath's Joker is the best on-screen villain since Hannibal Lecter. He shows the pure insanity of a tormented soul. I think he deserves an Oscar nomination and a win. I cannot say enough about his performance, plus his pencil disappearing trick is gruesome and hilarious.I also think that Aaron Eckhart gives a great performance as Harvey Dent/Two-Face. Only no one will notice because of Heath's brilliance.Christian Bale does a wonderful job, only quip is his voice when he is Batman is kind of weird. But that is minor complaint.I think we will see TDK nominated for several Oscars early next year, maybe even Best Picture."
7567,True,"I got into the theater on Friday alone to see the movie. Frankly, after seeing Ironman, The Hulk, Get Smart, Kung-Fu Panda, Hancock and Indiana Jones...I wasn't really excited. Face it, this year has been filled with High-Budget movies and now the comic movies will start releasing.So, I went alone for this movie, cos I had been anticipating it for a year now and a week before its release, I wasn't excited at all. What came next was highly unprecedented! For about 2 1/2 hours I was shut! The moment the first scene with Ledger ends, you know its not all about Batman. What makes this movie stand out is this fact...Batman is not alone in Gotham. And if DC faithful have read any of Frank Miller's Batman series, you will appreciate this movie greatly. Like with Batman Begins, 300 and Sin City...Frank Miller's vision are brought to life.I thought only Tarintino or Rodriguez could do justice to Miller's works. But Nolans (brothers) have taken this movie and made it into this mammoth depiction of three kind of men: The Good (Batman), The Bad (Joker) and The Ugly (Dent). If you look at the movie closely you will see a slight reflection of all the main characters int this film to the Eastwood classic. Think about it. One man will to any ends to do whats right. The other will go to any means to just 'watch the world burn'. And the last one makes wrong choices in life and circumstances make him an anti-hero with a bad personality! As a fan of Batman, I'm so happy that this movie has been received well. I hated when everyone around me was a Superman fan and I supported the Bat. Come on, Batman can so happen in real life! Plus, his toys used to be much kick-ass (yes, I had the Bat-mobile).The movie storyline is unprecedented at every stage and one can't guess what's gonna happen next. What I love the most about the movie however, is its end. Regular viewers may argue that the ending could have been better. But if you know Batman history...he is not supposed to be a 'hero or savior'. He is created and exists to be liked by a few, hated by many and feared by all. I loved the ending.This movie transcends into a whole new genre of movie-viewing audience. Those who want a good movie experience with a solid story-line and highly developed character-evolution. This movie is the complete package. The best movie I have seen in the last 15 years.In conclusion, even if you don't wanna watch 'superhero' movies, drop the attitude and go for this one. You don't even need to watch 'Begins' to watch this one. Bale, as with all his films is insane. All his movies are filled with a character one can relate to, as with this movie. Best actor of our generation.God bless Heath Ledger's soul, for leaving us with his best performance so far. He almost convinced me with his view of the world as joker in this movie.FILM-MAKING AT ITS BEST...AT LEAST SINCE THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS OR SO!"
7568,True,"I know there are a lot of people out there touting the greatness of Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, and even I was skeptical about whether or not it would hold up to the hype. For once a movie that everyone (critics and fan-boys alike) said was a masterpiece actually was. The Dark Knight manages to take on so much complexity and depth without losing it's audience to boredom. It has the feel of the old epic movies like the Godfather with it's grandiose and methodical nature.All of the performances are as good as they are said to be. Christian Bale's Batman/Bruce Wayne grows and matures throughout the film and doesn't become stagnant, as many established superhero characters sometimes do in their sequels. And yes, Heath Ledger really is that good as the Joker. His body language alone sets the tone for this version of the Joker, so that when he opens his mouth and speaks the wonderful dialog he has in the film your already sold on his lunacy. But I must say that the surprise of this film was Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two Face that really gave this film its heart. He was a surprise in the role and instantly went to the top of my own favorite character's list. Apart from those big three, all of the supporting cast, including Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, ad Gary Oldman do an excellent job of keeping their characters grounded and definitely make this an ensemble piece.This is the definitive comic book movie now, but it transcends that stereotype and becomes something more. And I'll leave off with the words of the Joker; You've changed things, Mr. Nolan. You've created something that has pushed beyond the limits of what everyone, including myself, thought a comic book movie could do. I recommend this to anyone looking to have a good time, regardless of whether you've ever seen a comic book movie before in your life. You won't be disappointed."
7569,True,"I went into the theater expecting a CGI-filled, rubber suit rendition of my favorite dark knight. I sat down, waited for the movie to start and that's all I remembered of my reality in my seat. Immediately after the movie started, I was transported to Gotham City, with all the darkness, crime and pain of many other cities. For a little while, I felt that Gotham actually existed, right up there with the seedy underbellies of NYC and LA. This is honestly and truly the best Batman film released to date, both with the casting and directing. Christian Bale was an excellent Bat, complete with his mental anguish and personal demons. I loved Michael Caine's Pennyworth. The part was made for him in mind, obviously. That is one actor that can make a butler seem more regal the the King himself! Maggie Gyllenhaal's Rachel was much more believable and multidimensional than Katie Holmes's stab at the part in the previous Bat film. Morgan Freeman's role may have been a little smaller as Lucius, but no less fantastic. But the one role that truly stood out was Heath Ledger's Joker. Don't get me wrong, I'm a Jack Nicholson fan, but Ledger not only did a sublime job as the Joker, but he LIVED the part. He absorbed it, and it became a part of his being. For Heath Ledger to leave us so abruptly, he left us a gift that would have outlived him anyway; his acting was a candle that flickered out too quickly. To the Nolans: I will never look at your directing the same way again!"
7570,True,"The Gotham crime syndicates are afraid of the caped crusader to the point where their employees cower in the shadows at the sight of the Bat-signal and the mob bosses hold their meetings during the day. Worried that their finances are about to be seized by Lt. Gordon's strike force, (Gary Oldman once more showing his greatness in even the straightforward roles he takes when on hiatus from the crazed villains he is used to playing), they pool it all together and hand over control to an Asian corporation, naively thinking it is safe from Gotham and new DA Harvey Dent's jurisdiction. Only the demented nihilist The Joker understands that Batman has no bounds when it comes to what he is capable of. A vigilante himself, the superhero can go where he pleases and extract Lau from China, the man with every penny owned by the city's underbelly in his seemingly safe hands. This fact isn't a question of could happen, but instead one of will happen. It is the first step in The Joker's elaborate plan to take control of the city and prove to all that even the pure of heart can be and will be corruptible. Human nature is flawed and he wants to show the world just how much. Money is inconsequential; all he wants is the power and control.While first seen as a fly sticking out of a bee swarm, Batman and Gordon don't take any real heed of The Joker's threat. It is the mob they are after and, with the help of Dent, are almost to the point where they can take them down for good. But as Harvey says, it is always darker before the dawn and this crazed maniac is blotting out the sun. Devoid of morals and seriously insane""do you want to know how I got these scars?""he takes no prisoners and consistently plays with everyone on his trail. A master of the human psyche, he is always two steps ahead of Batman and Gotham's finest, pulling the strings on who is to live and who is to die. With the finding of his polar opposite in the form of Bruce Wayne's alter-ego, The Joker is ready to have fun. Knowing how Batman's one rule is the inability to kill, he pushes his buttons and places the blame of those he kills onto Wayne's consciousness. Having a man like Dent there to stand for justice, face accessible to the world and not hidden behind a mask, Wayne's guilt drives him to the edge of finally letting his identity be known. The Joker is a wild card in the poker match of life, orchestrator of anarchy, turning the world on each other and soon doesn't even need to actually do any of the killings himself. Those he toys with find themselves falling to the darkness of revenge and greed, doing his bidding without even having to be asked.No one is safe in this pitch-black world of violence and crime, almost completely shrouded in shadow once the small glint of light that seemed about to break through is snuffed out. Nolan throws conventions out the window with his plotting and willingness to take a chance on letting those we may find to be untouchable become expendable. He also has honed his action skills by giving us a bit more of a wide angle view on fights, letting them happen before our eyes and not be constructed later with quick cuts that don't meld together. And the special effects, all I can say is bravo. From the new gadgets, (sonar systems and a kickass bat-cycle whose introduction is only upstaged by its ability to flip 90 degrees by riding up a building wall), to the make-up work, (The Joker is unsettling to view without Heath Ledger's superb acting work), to the computer graphics, (not to ruin anything, but Two-Face is a sight to see), The Dark Knight pulls no punches.With solid acting all around, Christian Bale and company carry over the success from the first film without fail. However, it is the newcomers that bring the standard for comic book performances up to a level that may never be eclipsed. Aaron Eckhart is great as Dent with his pretty boy looks and affable charm. Unable to be bullied or scared, Eckhart embodies the good that Gotham has in its future and the subtle hinting to the darkness always hiding behind the façade of someone that pure of heart. He himself said it best, ""you either die the hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain."" Foreshadowing at its best.But of course, the true amazement is with Ledger's Joker. When cast, many had their doubts, yet I remember always standing by the choice, knowing he could hit it out of the park if given the chance. Wow, this is the best villain ever put to screen. His vocal work and laugh are chilling and the facial ticks and licking of the lips just show the detail Ledger put in. The back-and-forths between him and Bale are always intriguing and exciting as the two powerhouses just put on a clinic and how about the introduction to his character at the start robbing the bank, what an entrance. The only part of this film that left me sad was the fact that we won't be able to see Ledger reprise the role in the next installment. Kudos to Nolan for already saying that they will not recast; it is an honor to the job Heath did and to the audience so as not to pull a switch, ruining the character and movie because no one could ever even attempt to match the craft that went into the role here. A fantastic performance in a fantastic filmwhatever you have heard, believe it."
7571,True,"It is the best of times, it is the worst of times to write a review. I just came back from watching The Dark Knight and my hands are a little sweaty from the thrill. In a way, I feel that is unfair to write about a film such as this after just one view. Like with any other great film, you need to watch it a few times to actually capture every detail, to have a broader, more serene vision of the different levels of the plot and the symbolism behind the action, and believe me, there's plenty of action, and I don't mean only the typical sequences that we are supposed to expect from a summer blockbuster, you know those that sometimes seem to be made by the numbers (1= Explosion, 2= Car chase, 3= Fist Fight, Etc.), in this film that kind of scene actually seems secondary to some little moments that are full of meaning, such as: A convict getting hold of a detonator to do what none else is willing to, or The joker sanitizing his hands at a hospital.Visual gems like these are the ones that actually move the plot forward and make it unique. They transform a simple story of good vs. evil and turn it into an exploration of morality, of the hopes that feed our dreams and the fears that fuel our nightmares. It would be easy to be tricked by the summary and believe that this movie is about the confrontation between Batman and the Joker, but I believe that Harvey Dent is the real center of the plot, the first two hours of the movie seem to be a prologue to his character behavior in the last 30 minutes, it's about him and his fight between light and darkness, where Batman and the Joker, like gods on a Greek tragedy, pull him in opposite directions, shaping his fate, but it is him who incarnates the message at the core of this film, that in human nature, good and evil are just two faces of the same coin.According to the trivia here, Nolan was influenced by Michael Mann's Heat (1995), and it does show in the tone and the message of this movie, however comic book fans will be satisfied by the multiple references to graphic novels like The Killing Joke, The Long Halloween and The Man Who Laughs. I know I was particularly happy to see a reference to Batman: Year One near the end of the movie: a moment that is fundamental to the relationship between Batman and Jim Gordon. In a year that has seen great adaptations from the comic book to the screen, The Dark Knight by far is the best of them all, it keeps all the key elements of the story and the characters from the Batman canon, while presenting them in a cinematic language and narrative that makes it a true work of art.You can not talk about the quality of The Dark Knight without making a reference to the acting. Bale, Caine, Oldman, Freeman and Gyllenhaal make a magnificent ensemble, delivering pitch perfect lines and grounding a superhero movie into reality with the very human interactions of their characters. And yet, incredible as it might seem, their performances pale next to those of Eckhart and Ledger. Eckhart gives us a roller coaster ride with a performance that goes from messianic politician, to man in love, to tortured soul and that literally kept me on the edge of my seat (I always thought this to be hyperbole used by critics, but no, it actually happens). A lot of ink and bytes have been spent on Ledger's performance, so I won't waste your time or mine trying to describe it. I just can say, if you are going to compare him to Jack Nicholson think of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) or The Shinning (1980).Chris Nolan has created with The Dark Knight one of those rare occasions when a sequel is actually better that a very good original. It's in a very exclusive league with the likes of Empire Strikes Back (1980) and The Godfather: Part II (1974). Great part of it's success being that it doesn't make you feel like is just another link for a franchise. Recently the IMDb poll asked what was my Christopher Nolan favorite movie to date and I answered Memento (2000) without hesitation, now I would have to answer differently. The Dark Knight is a far, far better film that he does, than he has ever done; is a far, far better film that I go to, than I have ever known."
7572,True,"If ever a comic book movie were to get a best picture nomination come February it would be The Dark Knight. To say this is just a comic book movie would not only be a disservice to the film, but an insult for this is much more than that. It is in essence an unbelievable film.So few films in any genre strive, and fewer still attain the kind of beauty that The Dark Knight captures in every facet possible. From the taught script by Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan(with an assist by David Goyer) the movie barrels at break-neck-speed and never truly lets up. It is also very intelligent; pursuing ideas on what it means to be a hero and how Batman through his disregard of the law is just a decision or two away from being The Joker. It also manages to be a social commentary relevant to our time. It brings up moral issues like public surveillance and whether or not the public when stretched to the brink by a madman, will sacrifice anyone or anything for their safety and in a sense destroy what separates them from the very thing that makes up a cornerstone of our society; courage, hope, and compassion.Now onto the performances. It is without a doubt that Heath Ledger's performance elevates this movie in such a way that without him, it would have been good, but with him is a gold standard. The way The Joker walks, talks, darts his tongue and licks his lips. Even the way he manages to alter the pitch and tone from high to low in a second shows craft that few other actors could accomplish. He truly becomes this character instead of just reciting lines. Others do amazing jobs. Christian Bale is the reliable rock of the movie and gives both he and Batman more depth as his character and alter ego are tested in every way possible. Michael Cane and Morgan Freeman get more to do and both have some fine speeches when advising Batman. Maggie Gyllenhaal is an upgrade from Katie Holmes and shows more grit and humanity in her role.The action is amazing. Best of all it's mostly done with real pyrotechnics and stunt work. This isn't a George Lucas movie with 99% of the screen done by computer generated effects. Christopher Nolan has really elevated his already amazing game to heights I would not have imagined.Simply put, this movie deserves every accolade, every good word-of-mouth review, and all of the awards I hope it collects throughout the year, especially come February. Yes Heath deserves his award and not because of his passing. If he were alive now, he would be picking it up himself when the time comes.At the end of the movie last night when I was walking out of the theater, someone in a crowd waiting to get into the next screening asked me if the movie was good. I looked at him seriously, then smiled and quoted Michael Cane's Alfred from the movie and said ""You have no idea""."
7573,True,"I was not used to a batman fan but after seeing this film I might become a fan of this dark knight. I can't exactly explain why this superhero movie attracts me, it's hard to tell. Maybe it's because of director Christopher Nolan's talent in making big movies, Bruce Wayne's (Christian Bale) charm, butler Alfred's sophistication, commissioner James Gordon's (Gary Oldman) disinterest or ...the Joker's (Heath Ledger) outstanding performance. I love all the characters and I respect all the actors and staffs in this film, you really done a great job!I had to admit that this movie horrified me when I walked out the cinema, it's way too bloody and strict for me. But after all, I still like it. I have some reflections to share. First, I have a feeling that the director is intending to challenge human being's kindness and morality through many scenes, take the two ship scene for example. Did you assume that anyone would press the button to save his own life regardless of others' lives? I did. (Shame on me.) And once you are one of them on the ship, will you ignite that damn bomb? Though this world is corrupted, the director wants to tell us that humanity is still existing. We will not become carnivore creatures cause we still have the virtue. Everyone should look on the bright side, tomorrow shall be fine. Second, the character Joker has great impact on me. He points out that large majority of us lead a life full of plans, orders and schedules. We live by rules. (How pathetic?) Once a plan has been changed, yours and my life would become a chaos. Does that means we can take things easier? Yes, I think so. He also mentioned that why everyone's so serious? In the film his subject is death and I changed it into other stuffs. Are we too serious about social position, salary, school diplomas and weight? Yes, we do. I'm one of them who the Joker's laughing at. I've made my life too complicated and it's quite dreadful sometimes. I have made a deal to myself, just take things easier. I believe I'll be happier then.Last, I would like to express my respect to Heath Ledger. He's such a fantastic artist and he left this world so young; it's a great loss to all the movie- lovers that we can't no longer looking forward to see his next movie. May you rest in peace, the Joker!"
7574,True,"Plot: Batman (Christian Bale) is cleaning the streets of Gotham with the help of Lt. Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the new D.A Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). It seems the time for Batman to hang up the cape is near, and Bruce Wayne/Batman can't wait to hand over the torch to ""the white knight"" Harvey. Enter the Joker (Heath Ledger) who makes the desperate gangsters an offer to ""kill the Batman."" Soon the entire city of Gotham is brought to their knees by the Joker as he starts to kill men off one by one, and play psychological games with the citizens of Gotham. Pros: The most intense movie I have ever seen, not a moment in this film is wasted time. All the characters have a very strong plot to them, however some have more than others. An example of this is Alfred's (Michael Caine) plot where he explains to Bruce about psychopaths. Terrific acting throughout the film. A movie that truly makes you believe in the city of Gotham with sweeping views of the city. The Joker is a truly menacing force, and you're eyes are drawn to him in every scene. While I have not seen any of Heath Ledger's previous work, I can say that he totally disappears into the character. The script also makes it very easy for him, and some of the Joker's games are truly interesting and revolting at the same time. Some very good plot twist's here, one involving Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and Harvey being taken hostage by the Joker. One of the greatest superhero/action/drama/thriller movies I've ever seen. Cons: If I have to say some negative... then I will say I found the Joker to be a bit corny at times, (blasphemy!) but their are so many good scenes for the Joker that you instantly forgive him. Overall: Go and see this movie. 5/5 Stars"
7575,True,"I can't remember this feeling of dread after leaving a movie theater since SE7EN and it's not that I don't think this is a fantastic movie, it's just that as much as I did read how intense it was before seeing it, I now realize I simply had no idea what I was about to go through. After a terrific chase scene involving several truck's and the Bat-cycle (or however you want to call it) I started to think perhaps we were at the end of the movie, little did I know the entirety of Act III was still ahead of us and with it the floor was about to be taken from under our feet again and again. When I saw the Joker coming out of a Hospital, dressed like a nurse and casually blowing it up I couldn't believe we were talking about a PG-13 movie (I guess we're way past post-9/11 sensibilities by now). Maybe repeated future viewings on DVD will soften the impact of this movie but if you haven't seen it, just know there are films ""not for children"" and there is THE DARK KNIGHT, the most intense film I've seen in years."
7576,True,"Rarely have I seen a sequel that is as good as or even better than the original one. ""The Dark Knight"" is a complete draw with ""Batman Begins"" as the best superhero film ever made. Unlike many other sequels, this Batman has a unique story of its own with great, intense action sequences, some philosophy, and an unforgettable villain.Easily, ""The Joker"" is the performance of Heath Ledger's life. He does not copycat off of Nicholson who was more humorous than anything. Ledger as The Joker, although having a wicked sense of humor, is more of a believable villain. He makes up all the ingredients as a sinister, cunning, and even psychotic antagonist. I did not recognize him at all in the role. Even his voice is unrecognizable. He is The Joker. I would not be surprised if he gets an Oscar nomination for his performance.Once again, Christian Bale is in the seat as Batman and is great at it. I found his character in this movie to be more ambivalent like Tobey Maguire was for Spider-man 2. The hero is drawn between whether he should continue his mantle as Gotham's hero, or let the law to take control with the new D.A. Harvey Dent.Aaron Eckhart, to my surprise, was excellent as Dent, who later becomes Two-Face. Like Bale, he demonstrates a character that has an internal struggle on what is right and what is wrong. In the end, it leads to tragedy.As with the plot, it circles around the original theme of good vs. evil. However, as good as a hero maybe, evil has a way of breaching walls and making the hero vulnerable which this movie demonstrates clearly with an unexpected death of a main character. As Michael Caine says in the movie, ""Some people just like to see the world burn."" Nonetheless, there's a bit of hope, as Eckhart says, ""We are in the darkbut the dawn is coming."" These simple lessons add much to the uniqueness of the film.""The Dark Knight"" is a dark movie more so than ""Batman Begins"". The behavior of the villains are ruthless and the violence at times is intense, but it is not overdone enough to be an R rating. For action lovers and Batman fans, this is the sequel you've been waiting for! There's plenty of hype to it! 10/10"
7577,True,"The best actors, a wonderful director, top-notch performances, a great story, and excellent special effects all combine to make The Dark Knight one of the best films I've seen in my life. This film presents shows tremendous growth in Bruce and Batman in that he must do not what is best for upholding his desire to help Gotham, but doing what is best so that Gotham will not lose hope. I thought the storyline involving those who pretended to be Batman was quite compelling in that Bruce indeed became the symbol he intended to be in Batman Begins. The story presents some fantastic ethical dilemmas to those caught in The Joker's ""jokes;"" the sequence involving the boats was emotionally powerful while not focusing on the main characters at all. Watch this movie and appreciate every moment of it."
7578,True,"Just got back from seeing this, I was originally going to see it after the w/e, but I was bored today so I watched 'Begins', then I had to go see this as soon as I could.There is very little that's bad with this movie. The acting, the pacing, the score (including the levels at which it played at the suitable times), the lack of CGI messing up scenes, a MUCH better Rachel Dawes, it goes on....quite a bit. But what would be the point of repeating such praise again and again in these IMDb user comments.The only things that I didn't dig so much, and this one goes for Begins as well, is that Gotham City doesn't look right. Pretty much the only thing Burton did right was gotham city (and I also liked the way he portrayed it's inhabitants), I do have a feeling that it was done as to not mirror the Burton films though. Also Two Face actually becoming fully bad could've been kept until the third movie too. It would've gone really well with the whole flow of the saga, because unlike ALL other (superhero) comic book film adaptions, the villains carry on and the films are linked by them. It's not just new villain who dies at the end, because thats not how the comics work. So yeah, he could've just crawled from the wreck after he shot the driver, and left the audience unsure of what exactly happened to him.I'll have to wait and see how it flows into the third installment though, it may end up working really well.I liked the way you expected the BatCave, but it wasn't there, which again adds to the flow of the saga....I like the fact that the 'batmobile' was destroyed, so hopefully there's a new design for three cos I really disliked this Batmobile even though it sounded awesome.I'll have to see it again to make up my mind on the, sonar phone watching centre. Not because of the plausibility of it, but more-so the morality. I need to see if Batman was pained by having to do that, because in my opinion, loss of civil rights/human rights is much much worse then death. The scene seemed to say that if it's necessary, it's necessary which is blergghh. They could've just had all the phones in Gotham being monitored, but just by audio, had a continuous track on the Jokers voice print (which are much more unique then fingerprints) and then for it to come up only when it was found, and then only on that call as to not destroy individuals privacy.Even with all the negatives I mentioned it still deserves a 9.5 . God I wish you could give half points, I want to give many things half points.....10 perhaps if it wasn't for the phone issue, but yeah. Great film.9/10(Reviewed after first viewing)"
7579,True,"And no, not because of Batman and the Joker, though they do lend a lot of credence to the film. The true hero is Harvey Dent, and his depiction as he is played for a pawn by the Joker. Batman needs no introduction, we had an entire movie, Batman Begins, dedicated to him. The Joker, Nolan left out his story on purpose, that we could be introduced to a, for loss of a better word, maniac. But Dent. Alluded to his past in internal investigations, his reputation already shadowed at his future self. His trademark coin toss, tricking the viewer into believing they were watching a psychopathic gambler masquerading as a lawyer as he tosses the life of the Scarecrow without even a hint of mercy. Once we realize it was never the gamble we were led to believe, the Joker deals him from the bottom of the deck, making him into the iconic villain we had come to expect of him. No, not Tommy Lee's Two-Face. The true Two-Face, one armed with self-righteousness, a coin, and a gun. Our pity is with him right up to the moment he flips the coin to decide the boys life, hoping that he would turn face and just leave. Even as he falls, I was hoping that he may survive, that one of Batman's greatest villains being killed by a 30 foot fall seemed incredulous. But now I understand. This is Nolan's Batman. This was not about the villain Two-Face like Batman Returns. This was about the hero Harvey Dent."
7580,True,"Just got home from watching the Dark Knight and wow, and i mean wow. The acting was great, the plot, the build up, the climax and everything was excellent and it has surely surpassed its hype! Christian Bale delivered another strong performance as the Batman and his Bruce Wayne character is even stronger now than the first film. Aaron Eckheart did also a very good Harvey Dent/Two Face; and by the way, the effects for the disfigured face of Two Face is awesome (looks like the one in the long halloween). And hell, Heath Ledger even surpassed Jack Nicholson's Joker.And at the end of the day, after all that happened, Batman didn't get what he wanted, Harvey Dent surely didn't get what he deserved and Gotham City as a whole surely lost. It was actually only the Joker who won. It would have been better if they showed one after credits shot of the Joker laughing his ass off inside Arkham Asylum; but that would be wishful thinking.:)"
7581,True,"Set almost immediately after ""Begins"", The Dark Knight focuses on Batman's fight against the Joker, a criminal mastermind and mass murderer who is gathering all of Gotham's criminals under his banner. With the body count piling up, Batman, along with his close allies Lucius Fox (Freeman), Detective Gordon (Oldman), Harvey Dent (Eckhart) and his faithful butler Alfred (Caine), must bring the Joker to justice before he turns Gotham City inside out.This movie was perfect in almost every aspect. A solid script, great action sequences, suspense and well-portrayed characters, this movie definitely surpasses all the hype.The action sequences in DK were brilliant. They kept you on the edge of your seat with suspense and excitement. I myself almost fell off my seat wondering if Batman really was going to kill the Joker or spare him.The movie, however, is not just a movie about a Superhero. There were parts in this movie that i found interesting. Such as the scenes in which people's lives were placed in the hands of others. These scenes really help to investigate the dark side of the human mind and in some aspects, brings out the joker in all of us. This made this film more than just a Superhero film, but somewhat of a psychological thriller as well.The characters in this film were very well-portrayed. Maggie Gyllenhall's depiction of Rachel Dawes was interesting and definitely different from Katie Holmes'. She gave Dawes a stronger character in a way which was more suitable for this film as Rachel played a much bigger role. Aaron Eckhart was brilliant as Harvey Dent. His performance was powerful and confident and portrayed Gotham's new hero as the kind of hero you would expect.However, best of all would be Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. Ledger's portrayal of the Joker was creepy, disturbing and downright scary. It differed greatly from Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the character, giving it the creepiness it needs to portray a psychotic mass murderer. He simply captures every scene and has the ability to either make us laugh or make us cringe.Overall, this movie not only lives up to the hype, it surpasses it. The Dark Knight is hands-down, the best Batman movie ever and maybe even the best comic-based film ever."
7582,True,"I just saw it. This is the most horrible movie i have ever seen. Please don't waste your time. The story makes no sense. The characters are stiff like frozen cucumbers, the purpose and motivations are completely ridiculous. This is a disgrace of a movie. It is as if the director wanted to create the antibatman. Oh My God! Oh My Buddha! Wasted life! There is no logic, the characters are half-dimensional, the star is beyond ridiculous and annoying, the joker is on drugs, the pace is awful they jump from scene to scene like monkeys jump from tree to tree. The director clearly had no vision. I don't know what to say other than STAY AWAY. STAY AWAY."
7583,True,"A man who is not willing to give up on humanity. A man who is willing to do anything do destroy humanity. Two worlds collide, and one of the best quotes to never hit the big screen. ""it only takes one bad day to deduce the sanest man alive to lunacy, that is how far the world is to where I am, Just one bad day"" - Joker. Beautiful! How can anyone not say that this is one of Heath Ledgers greatest rolls of the ultimate bad guys. I love this movie! I still watch this movie and want the Joker to win. HAHAHAHA!!! What else must I say about the movie that is capable of so much more if you give it a chance. let the plot show you how deviant the Joker is and how Bruce Wayne will not stand for it AND the Batman will not falter in his quest for Justice."
7584,True,"Nolan has done it again, with arguably his best work ever! I must say first, I am not a comic book reader, nor have I ever been. Although I like some heroes more than others, I am not a very big Batman fan, either. I just never thought he was that special or a good superhero, more like a rich man with armor and guns. While I was never a big fan of Batman, I am a HUGE fan of The Dark Knight!!! This movie was perfect, nothing short of perfect. First off, I tip my hat to the late Heath Ledger for his flawless performance of the Joker. Second, Christopher Nolan has shined once again. I saw this in theaters and when I left, I was amazed. Not only was the overall movie very well paced and interesting, the ending was perfect: Batman took the wrap for Two-Face's crimes so Gotham could keep their hero, while Batman became the enemy. Truly incredible.Even the music was great..Hans Zimmer never fails, his music was great in Inception, too (also a Nolan movie).I didn't think the sequel to Batman Begins would be as good, I was wrong, it was 5x better!If you want a movie that is serious, but also exciting and amazing, The Dark Knight should be at the top of your list.10/10, truly a great all time movie."
7585,True,"I imagine one of the last things in the world IMDb needs is another Dark Knight user review, but I can't help myself. Every time I am channel surfing and come across it, I'm overwhelmed by how good this movie is.I am genuinely surprised by how many detractors this movie has. It is utterly fantastic. It's important to approach it with the right perspective. This is a SUPER HERO FANTASY FILM! You can sit here all day and talk about how stupid it is no one can recognize Bruce Wayne, and how implausible the Jokers' mega-crimes are and how ridiculous Batman's Hong Kong extraction was, but then you are missing the joy. In reality there are no bullet-proof flying do-gooders from other planets in big red capes, and there are no hapless kids swinging through the air after being bit by radioactive spiders. Similarly, you have to dispense with a certain amount of credulity to love the Batman saga.I can't imagine what else needs to be said about Heath Ledger's Joker, but yes, he is that good. My only complaint about the movie is there is so much content and action here they could have easily added 20 minutes of filler fluff and made 2 separate movies out of it (hardly a legitimate complaint however). One of the all-time greats."
7586,True,"Lets get straight to the point. The plot is set out to perfection. it doesn't rush itself and tells the story brilliantly. The way it elegantly portrays the jokers sick humour when threatening the 2 boats containing prisoners and citizens. not to mention the tension when one boat has to blow up the other leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat. The film also shows that batman is shown not be a unbeatable hero and has a side of realism that christopher nolan directs really well. But my favourite thing about the dark knight is the excellent acting of the late heath ledger and his role of the joker is quirky, sinister and what makes the dark knight one of my favourite films of all time."
7587,True,"The theme to this film (which is a continuation in the series and in theme from Batman Begins) is that good versus evil is not only an external fight between a ""good"" guy and a ""bad"" guy, but also is a constant battle that rages inside each and every one of us. Christian Bale, as Bruce Wayne, is forced to make a great deal of judgment calls based upon the circumstances being piled against him by The Joker, played by Heath Ledger. Unfortunately, some of the choices and actions he performs cause him to become alienated from his closest friends, and ultimately the city in its entirety. But in doing so, he solidifies himself as the classic tragic hero that the city loves and hates in equal measure.Throughout the film, Harvey Dent (played by Aaron Eckhart) undergoes a dramatic transformation through giving in to this darker side. He begins as what the people of Gotham City refer to as the ""White Knight"", due to his relentless pursuit of justice and for being a seemingly incorruptible source of good. As he is brought low by the machinations of The Joker, Bruce is forced to sacrifice his own appearance of ""good"" to prevent Dent's fall from grace from completely disheartening the already injured psyche of Gotham City.In keeping with the tradition of Batman Begins, this film goes above and beyond anything I expected or hoped for. Bale, Ledger, and Eckhart form an engrossing triangle that keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout. With equal parts action and suspense, you're never left complacent. The characters are so ""real"" that you find yourself getting sucked into their world almost immediately. Bale continues to make Bruce Wayne a believable, albeit moody, hero forced into making decisions that I wouldn't wish upon even my worst enemy.With a villain like the Joker, many (myself included) were worried about whether he would be convincing as a source of evil as opposed to a quirky ""joke"" of a nemesis as has been too frequently betrayed in the past through the Batman franchise (just watch Jim Carrey as ""The Riddler"" in Batman & Robin). Ledger gave a mind-blowing performance with equal parts cruelty, humor, and crazy. He created a persona so creepy yet brilliant, you're almost always left in awe when he is on the screen.All in all, a fantastic sequel that leaves the audience veritably foaming at the mouth for the next installment."
7588,True,"I have never seen a perfect movie, and did not know there could be such a thing. But this is it. I have always been a Batman fan. But this was so much more than a comic book movie. It was an epic. Even if had nothing to do with the character we know and love, it would still have an excellent story. It's suspenseful, funny, terrifying, heartwarming. It literally has everything you could want from a movie. And it seems REAL. The Batmobile didn't look like a bat, it looked like a tank, able to withstand anything. Plus it held the Batpod. How awesome was that? And the Joker! Heath Ledger, may he rest in peace, did absolutely some of the best acting I have ever, ever seen. He WAS the Joker. Not some cheesy bad guy. He was a REAL psychopath. He was both hilarious and terrifying. And his objective was to cause chaos. Not greed. Just to wreak havoc on Gotham City, and especially on Batman. And the whole story is phenomenal. It's over two and a half hours long, yet it doesn't seem like it at all. You never want it to end. It starts with a bang and never slows down. And the armored car chase? Easily the best car chase ever put on film. I watched this movie three times in the theater. I've never done that. And I LOVE movies. Great story, great REAL effects (the only CGI in the entire movie was Two-Face, and I'm glad Christopher Nolan did that right and not Like Tommy Lee Jones), and the acting - top notch across the board. I can't wait to see how how Nolan tops this, because you know he will this. I can't believe it didn't even get a nod for best picture. A shame. At least Ledger won. He deserved every bit of the hype. He and Nolan both went above and beyond all expectations."
7589,True,"This is in itself a pretty good movie. But as a Batman movie, it's an epic fail. Christian Bale is the worst Batman ever. No, he's not a bad actor - he's a really good actor, in fact. But he doesn't feel like a true Bruce Wayne at all. The Joker is too serious and realistically psychotic, and Harvey Dent does not suffer from having a split personality like he is supposed to have.And yeah, the biggest flaw of this movie and Batman Begins - they try so hard to be realistic, it's kinda pathetic. If Nolan wants to make his own movies, that's fine. But Batman, realistic? I don't care what people say - there's NOTHING realistic about a guy dressing up like a bat to fight crime. Nor should it be. The fans of the movie claims it's realistic because we are supposed to take it as serious as possible. Uhm, really? I'm sorry, but are the fans of this movie that dumb? Since when does it require a movie is realistic for us to take it serious? Was Watchmen realistic? Was Lord of the Rings realistic? Was Pan's Labyrinth realistic? Of course they weren't. Yet, all of them are easier to take serious than this overrated movie.It even breaks it's own rules of being realistic... and it does so all the time. Like when the Tumbler gets trashed, and Batman makes a bat-pod pop out of it. Now, this IS a cool thing to have in a Batman movie. Only problem is - this is supposed to be realistic... and that's everything BUT realistic to have such a convenient feature. And how about when Batman punches the Joker in the head several times without him fainting, or even getting dissy (except the first time)? Oh, and I guess it's really realistic near the end when Batman gets attacked by the rottweilers biting him and the Joker beating the living s**t out of him with a crowbar at the same time? And like I said, I don't get why they changed the Joker so much here. He seems almost insecure. And why does he have a plan to spread anarchy and chaos? The Joker is supposed to BE anarchy and chaos. But here, he's just a confused psycho who doesn't seem to know what he thinks himself. Oh, and the BS in the end when Batman tosses out the Joker - in self defense, mind you - to fall down the skyscraper, and then he manages to save him. What's that load of bull about? It wasn't even his fault... and how the heck could he catch him up so well? And really; if he was THIS careful about saving all the criminals from dying - wouldn't he have saved Ra's Al Ghul in the end of the first movie? He says ""I won't kill you... but I don't have to save you"". Uhm, that's technically to kill him, Batman. But hey, what do I know? Keeping the psychotic crime clown alive who will not stop for anything in his search for chaos might be a lot better than letting the one live who one could be able to discuss with, and who Bruce has a long friendship story with. Genius...And really, Nolan... you're dissing SO much from the ACTUAL Batman universe for the sake of your realism. Like villains such as Mr Freeze, Killer Croc, Clayface, Poison Ivy etcetera. And you are even dissing Robin because you are ""afraid people won't take that serious""? As far as I am concerned, Nolan is just too much of a coward to try to challenge himself to do things like they are supposed to be - and still making us take it serious. I mean, come on - Batman: Under the Red Hood did this. Sure, it was an animated movie.... but weird enough, it felt more authentic than the Nolan flicks. Isn't that saying something? Batman should not live in a realistic world, period. I mean, come on - they didn't even try to make Gotham City in the movies original and unique. To quote behind-the-scenes from Batman Begins, their Gotham City is ""New York on steroids"". This movie does not deserve it's praising."
7590,True,"Christopher Nolan's latest film in the batman movie franchise is superb. The acting is some of the best i have ever seen, you really feel like you know these characters at a personal level by the end. The joker really pushes batman closer and closer to the line the separates crime-fighter and vigilante. And Bruce Wayne struggles to keep his personal life away from his batman side. Heath ledger is amazing as the joker, he does everything correct, even the signature laugh. At one part the joker is sticking his head out of a police car enjoying the chaos that he just put upon Gotham. Throughout the movie Batman constantly struggles to thwart the jokers plans of mayhem before they can take effect, and he fails for the most part until the end, but i shan't spoil that. This movie is the darkest batman movie ever, this new take on the batman franchise is great. And this movie really embodies how Nolan wants Batman to be. And the movie is just overall amazing!"
7591,True,"""The Dark Knight"" is a rare example of a movie where *everything* is in place.Christopher Nolan doesn't cut corners. This movie easily surpasses even the highest expectations and I immensely enjoyed watching it. The plot was convincing and original. The script was smooth and clever. The dialogues were interesting and memorable. The camera work was top quality. There was absolutely no scene where I would think something like ""hey I've seen this before *and* the original was better"" or ""hmm, this served no purpose."" Heath Ledger's performance was outstanding. I mean others were great too (Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine) but... Heath, who portrayed the Joker, was just brilliant. Unlike many other movie villains who are basically pitiful clowns, his ""clown"" is a true villain. He's the guy you don't want to encounter even if you're a masked vigilante, because the price is too great. The Joker has no weaknesses and no inhibitions. Like the devil himself, he's smart, charismatic, dedicated, scary and, in his own sick and morbid way, funny. Worse yet, he corrupts people, he finds the seeds of evil in the darkest corners of their souls.""The Dark Knight"" is a true masterpiece. Even if you don't like Batman movies in general, chances are, you'll enjoy this one.10/10"
7592,True,"Umm, I am speechless or in this case, typeless to not even describe how this movie is. There is a turn at every corner and I mean awesome freaking out heart stopping scary stuff. Also, there are several beautiful visual effects going on here like the spectacular Batman-jumps-out-of-window- into-plane-with-Chinese-crook-in-hand stunt. That was awesome. The hospital explosion was great as well and Harvey dies?! If you watched the first movie then prepare to get your shoes, socks and everything blown off then this is the movie for you. I really sorry that Heath Ledger died though. He was a great actor in this movie. Just watch it, don't hesitate, watch it. Good luck."
7593,True,"The world may say this is the best movie of 2008 and for many, it's the best to date. But honestly its just smart film making and the contribution of Heath's performance and death that made this a hit. Overall however, this film lacks substance, depth and emotion. Racheal Dawes's character is a joke; she just dies and gone, kaput! nothing! Harvey Dent's obsession doesn't come across. And Joker being Batman's nemesis doesn't figure anywhere.There'll be many who disagree with me, but in the long run if you love cinema you will know the movies that stay with you; this definitely is not one of them."
7594,True,"The very high rating this movie got was the main reason for me to go and see the movie at the cinema.This ended in a disappointment, in that way, it was an okay action movie. The Joker is very cool played by Heath Ledger, but he alone is carrying the movie. Cut away the Joker and there is not much left of an original movie. Even WITH the Joker, the story and the action scenes are not very original and mostly seen before in other (batman) movies. The biggest disappointment was the fact there was still 15-20 minutes movie left at the end of the story and that's boring...So, rating this movie one of the 5 best movies ever is absolutely very very and very overrated. A small 7 is a by far more realistic rating, because there is absolutely no way this movie can beat movies like 'Pulp Fiction', 'One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest', 'Star wars', 'the LOTR Trilogy' and more it's genre: 'Iron Man', and so on, all the way down the top 250..."
7595,True,"I didn't really like Batman Begins... Batman has been commercial ever since the first movie in 1989, everyone from your granny to the school janitor knows how batman 'became.' To me it was just another excuse to sell Batman and make more money, regardless of how good the direction was.Well, I DIDN'T think The Dark Knight was douche, but I still prefer the 1989 Batman by Tim Burton over this one. No disrespect to the late Heath Ledger either, BUT I did prefer Jack Nicholson's Joker over Ledger's. I found, at times, Ledger's Joker, overly dark and annoying. I liked Two Face though- they made a really good job of that; MILES better than Tommy Lee Jone's Two-Face. MILES. Was a shame to see him get ****** instead of The Joker.At times Batman's voice was hard to make out what he was saying, and, towards the end, got kinda amusing to hear. Michael Caine was a terrible Alfred... I hate all this 'lets put an English sidekick in here to spill one liner after the hero explains or cracks something. Every time I see Caine I just think of camp 60's movies and the Italian Jobs, in the same way that I see Christian Bale in a suit and think of American Psycho. I like Bale's Bruce Wayne, but only because of his powerful role in American Psycho. To me, Chistian Bale in Batman, is Patrick Bateman dressed up as Batman XD.Sometimes the story moves a little too fast to keep up with (which wouldn't be a problem for the people that have growing up watching Batman movies'n'cartoons), but the average person would perhaps get confused.7.4/10- Overall."
7596,True,"Dark Knight, the long awaited sequel to one of my favorite actions films (not just action hero or superhero film), Batman Begins, finally arrives with a build-up, which included a IMDb user rating the highest ever, that surely no movie could possibly live up to. I went to the movie with my spouse and my business partner, both very discerning people who had equally high expectations. We wanted to see the IMAX version, and we had to wait until Tuesday as the first weekend was sold out at our venue.The cinematography at the beginning of the movie (without revealing details)has my buy in, taking full advantage of IMAX, as the action unfolds. The first several minutes doesn't disappoint, and then all of sudden, like a 70mm film was cut, and a unfinished raw project was spliced in, comes disappointment. That disappointment comes slow at first, and then building to a crescendo, which culminates in a hodgepodge of flawed cinematography, an underdeveloped protagonist and a lack of longing to see the completion of a possible trilogy (although #3 can't be as bad as this one). I too was blown away, but not in a good way.I was wondering, as the movie, was everything was looking so small, as if I was Gulliver and I had travel to the island of bad film noir. Gotham General Hospital looked like a clinic, which couldn't have possibly had many rooms as there was hardly enough room for a lab. The movie should have had a title with ""Joker"" or ""Two-Face"" in it, because Christian Bale's role was relegated to a man or myth moving through scenes with mechanical ease, while occasionally satisfying the special effects crowd. Where was Wayne Enterprises, or was Fox's office really in that room with no furniture and more displays than all the TV stations in Chicago (where most of the movie was shot)? In my opinion Maggie Gyllenhall, did an adequate job of playing the role of Rachel Dawes, but I don't think she is very good looking and as a result the competition between Dent and Wayne wasn't even a consolation event. (Dresses from WHICH century?) The transitions from Deep Focus to Shallow Focus were, in my opinion flawed and extremely irritating. What made the cinematography worse was the sequence in editing where transition which were smooth and logical in Batman Begins were choppy and even looked amateurish in many of the scenes (always landing at the upper torso turned left, and yes I know the motion direction is left but enough...NOT EVERY TIME!!!) I was hoping to see a movie the likes of Shawshank. I should have known that it is very unlikely to see an action or adventure film, which would rise to the top."
7597,True,"The night is dark. After a brief period in which organised crime retreated into a minor enterprise, Gotham City has once again fallen into shadow. The Caped Crusader has done all that he could, but, if he is to eradicate corruption once and for all, he will require the cooperation of Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman), the untouchable honest cop, and Havey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), the newly-appointed district attorney and Gotham's celebrated ""White Knight."" However, the emergence of a cackling, deranged psychotic, dubbed The Joker (Heath Ledger), threatens to throw the entire city into chaos  how deeply can he corrupt the uneasy alliance between Gotham City's authorities? 'The Dark Knight (2008)' is director Christopher Nolan's eagerly-awaited sequel to his own 'Batman Begins (2005),' which successfully rebooted the Batman franchise and returned some class to the ""superhero"" genre in general. Unapologetically dark in tone, Nolan's film further explores the split-personality relationship of Bruce Wayne/Batman, comparing and contrasting him with Harvey Dent as he spirals downwards into his persona as super-villain Two-Face.In terms of character development, 'The Dark Knight' seems to have shifted itself into neutral gear. Whereas 'Batman Begins' portrayed Bruce Wayne's transformation from an angst-ridden, morally-conflicted billionaire to his noble, crime-fighting alter ego, Christopher and Jonathan Nolan, who penned the screenplay, here seem satisfied with Batman as the tough, unaffected crusader. Though there is a noticeable shift in how the audience perceives Batman's role in Gotham City  he changes from a righteous champion to a shadowy vigilante, depending upon the needs of its citizens  Bruce Wayne faces few of the moral dilemmas explored into the film's predecessor, and, despite the good work of Christian Bale, his character is not altogether of much interest. Aaron Eckhart undergoes a more interesting (and much more literal) transformation as the ""White Knight"" who is irretrievably corrupted by the evil psychological games of The Joker. Eckhart is convincing in the role, though his conversion to the ""dark side"" seemed to have been rushed, and that Batman's final confrontation was with Two-Face rather than the Joker is an unfortunate anti-climax.Of course, nothing but praise may be heaped upon the late Heath Ledger, whose characterisation of The Joker will be undoubtedly be remembered for decades to come. The Australian actor, long known down here for his performances in 'The Patriot (2000)' and 'Ned Kelly (2003),' passed away in tragic circumstances on January 22, 2008 from an ""accidental overdose of prescription drugs."" Following his Oscar-nominated performance in 'Brokeback Mountain (2005),' Ledger was at the cusp of the Hollywood A-list, and his performance here  even without the higher pedestal bestowed to those recently passed  would undoubtedly have rocketed his professional career to unprecedented heights. Ledger's Joker, a far cry from the high camp of Jack Nicholson's equally-memorable turn in 'Batman (1989),' is a chilling mix of Hannibal Lecter and Alex DeLarge, a cackling psychopathic clown who, despite his fondness for chaos, frequently engineers his schemes to uncanny perfection. Nolan deliberately avoids any back-story for Ledger's character, though The Joker himself offers two conflicting anecdotes, the result being that his villainous motives are disconcertingly ambiguous.As in 'Batman Begins,' the soundtrack composed by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer is wonderfully moody and ominous, and Wally Pfister's shadowy cinematography serves the story well. Christopher Nolan's greatest talent lies, above all else, with setting the required mood. The atmosphere of Gotham City is consistently bleak and oppressive, a tone that only intensifies as The Joker begins to leave his mark on its residents. He possesses an anarchistic belief that, at heart, all humans are selfish and corruptible, and his disturbed social experiments  extrapolated from the classic game theory of the Prisoner's Dilemma  are designed to confirm this belief, that, in order to survive, ordinary people will commit seemingly unjustifiable atrocities. Whereas there might once have been a time when the residents of Gotham City would have detonated the opposite ferry, the influence and dedication of Harvey Dent has inspired citizens with a new optimistic spirit. Gotham's White Knight may have been corrupted by forces of evil, but his legacy remains, and that is more great a defeat than The Joker could have anticipated."
7598,True,"It was summer, mid-June, 2005. After seeing the previous and futile attempts at a good Batman movie fail miserably throughout the 90's, I was dragged to the theater by my brother to see Batman Begins. After LOVING Batman as a child, the previous installments of Batman movies made me disinterested in the franchise altogether. I had given up. Then...Wow! Batman Begins was an eye-opening masterpiece. It explained, for the first time, WHY somebody would want to dress up as a bat and fight crime. By the time Batman Begins came out, I had no clue WHY the Batman character would even exist. The development of Batman was about as good of ""character development"" as possible in a movie. It laid the ground-work for the masterpiece that became ""Batman Begins"", a movie I have now watched at least a dozen times.Fast-forward to 2008. Needless to say, I was more excited for ""The Dark Knight"" to come out than any movie in my 33 years on Earth! I simply couldn't wait. I watched the two main trailers probably a hundred times each. And being a Heath Ledger fan (he was tremendous in ""Brokeback"") - my enthusiasm and eagerness was at an all-time high. I purchased my tickets two weeks in advance for the 12:05 AM showing on Thursday night/Friday morning. And then......though I liked the movie, it did not have the much-needed character development that existed in Batman Begins, therefor it was not quite as good in my opinion. I walked in expecting to see WHY the Joker became the Joker, just as WHY Batman became Batman in the previous installment. Think back to why Batman became Batman (in Batman Begins). Bruce Wayne explained to Alfred ""People need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy and I can't do that as Bruce Wayne, as a man I'm flesh and blood. I can be ignored I can be destroyed, but as a symbol, as a symbol I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting."" He was also afraid of bats as a child (there was a reason and background story for that too) and this was a way he could create a symbol and overcome his childhood fears, both at the same time. It showed, not only HOW he created the bat-suit, but the WHY! There was a reason for every piece of the costume, even the cape. It showed why he had a Batcave, why he needed to keep his identity a secret, why Commissioner Gordon began to trust him, and why he and Rachel had such a long-lasting love.Now the Joker - how did they develop that character? In short, they really didn't. They quickly mentioned at the start why he wore face paint (one of the crooks claimed it was to scare people, like war paint). That was it, no background story at all. Why did he come to Gotham? Another quick answer, no background. Why did he have the hate in his heart to do all these horrible things? No background there either. The Two-Face character should have been scrapped (waited for a part 3 perhaps) and more background to the WHY's of Joker's personality should have been written in. (And since the only truly memorable scenes had The Joker in them, they should have made more scenes with him!) The Joker's childhood, like that of Bruce Wayne in Batman Begins, would have been enthralling. Instead, we get a couple of contradicting verbal sentences from the Joker on why his face was the way it was...and nothing more. To have shown a young Joker, perhaps getting abused by his father, perhaps wrongfully arrested and harassed by police throughout his teen years, then perhaps an accident which caused scarring and burning to his face...that would have been the way to go. Instead, in The Dark Knight, the Joker simply is the Joker because he is.I also need to mention a quick scene that was beyond ignorant. When the Joker is captured and put in jail, he virtually evacuates the police station by telling the Batman the addresses of where Two-Face and Rachel were located. The Joker is in a locked interrogation cell with one-sided glass. Would have been quite easy to just leave him in there! Could have just watched him through the glass or not watched him at all! Instead, they put an unarmed guard, a guy who has had 6 of his friends murdered by the Joker, in the cell with him! WTF?! The Joker quickly and easily antagonizes him into a fight and wins, creating his escape from jail and prolonging the movie at the same time...big surprise there.Still, on it's own, The Dark Knight is a good piece of action and adventure. And the Joker was played wonderfully by Heath Ledger. The feel of an epic crime drama was done well. But, simply put, this movie would have been better if Two-Face had been introduced at the end of the ""TDK"", like The Joker was introduced at the end of ""Begins"". And that would have opened up more screen time for The Joker's early background. Then it would have been perfect. Instead...A good movie -- but, oh boy, what could have been...8/10 - thanks for reading! JD"
7599,True,"I enjoyed ""The Dark Knight"" a lot. I thought that it was an incredible movie, one that hopefully will deliver an Oscar in Heath Ledger's memory. His performance as the Joker far surpasses Jack Nicholson in the original ""Batman"", and I was a big fan of that role. However, I feel that some things in the movie could have been tweaked.First, to address the obvious problem: what to do with the Joker? I don't envy the filmmakers in their task of having to deal with Ledger's death. His death before the filming had finished left filmmakers without an option of what to do with the Joker. In the film, he just disappears. This to me signals that the third Batman movie will take place much later, after the Joker has been killed. The role cannot be re-cast, so this, to me, is the only option.Also, why was Two-Face only in the movie for such a short time? He plays a very important role in the development of some characters (Robin) further down the road. I think that ""The Dark Knight"" failed to build an outline for the next movie. After seeing the Joker card at the end of ""Batman Begins"", the direction of ""The Dark Knight"" wasn't fully obvious, but it was certainly understood the arch rivals Batman and Joker would fight. With this movie, there's no real direction. Who's the next villain? Do they bring back Two-Face? These questions could hurt the movie down the road.Again, I would like to make it known, I really think the movie was great. I just feel that things could have been better.Oh, and to those of you who are reading this thinking ""The Dark Knight"" is the best movie ever...let's be realistic. This movie in no way compares to ""Citizen Kane"" or ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". I will agree it is one of the best, if not the best, movie based on a comic book ever. And it's box office records will stand for some time. But to call it the greatest film ever is absurd. I guarantee it won't even win Best Film at the Oscars."
7600,True,"I watched The Dark Knight in my country, Indonesia. We didn't get the ultra-hype for this movie like our friends at USA. I really want to know how this movie really is, because I read in the net that Dark Knight is one of the most anticipated movie of the year.I see the movie and I gotta say that it was great. The Dark Knight was clever, brilliant, and outstanding when we compare with another action movie. But it isn't flawless. I could say that The Dark Knight is not a masterpiece. You know a Masterpiece when you seen one. Don't get me wrong, The Dark Knight delivered a deep drama, an elegant acting (standing ovation for Heath Ledger...) but it has a lot of holes in the plot. We don't know what happen with the Joker at the end, and how Harvey Dent falling into the Dark Side. Although the death of Rachel gives the movie a high praise for not going dull (normally the death of the main girl was too corny, but in The Dark Knight Nolan made it very cool without losing the grieve)Sure, The Dark Knight is a very sophisticated movie, If you compare this movie with another superheroes movie. But I don't think this is the Best movie of the 2008..."
7601,True,"Yesterday I traveled 250 km to Athens, Greece to watch the ""Dark Knight"", since I was in a town with no cinemas!! I was anxious after having watched ""Batman Begins"" and also curious to see for myself just how accurate the reviews that praised the film were and also just how good could Heath Ledger's acting really be.As a quick overall conclusion I must say that ""The Dark Knight"" is a masterpiece. Don't get me wrong but calling a film a masterpiece doesn't make it flawless and doesn't automatically grant it a 10/10 mark. Anyway, in my opinion, classifying a work of art as number 1,2,63 or 134 of all time is a total waste of time. There cannot be any objective criteria in art and especially in films. There are so many genres, so many different things a film can offer you and so many themes explored in the art of cinema that such a classification doesn't do any justice neither to the creators nor to the audience of a film.Starting with the storyline. ""The Dark Knight"" can be watched without having watched ""Batman begins"". That is a very essential point. This is what makes a film whole and unique. Those ready to watch a cartoon -like comic book superhero film should not even bother... This is Christopher and Jonathan Nolan's vision of a realistic 21st century metropolis, controlled by organized crime (actual mafia) and every level of its infrastructure corrupt by it. Everyone knows that you don't want to mess with such a ""regime"" because the consequences will be catastrophic and unpredictable, as in a war. And people are obviously scared. Therefore what is needed is someone to take this fear and through a symbol or an idea, lash it out on the crime lords. This is Batman. But this will inevitably lead to war. A war where anything is acceptable and the heroes morals and methods are always put to the test, because as symbols, their actions can be checked only by themselves. But Batman is human and therefore flawed. Who gives him the right to decide what's wrong or right? Therefore, out of this war, social instability grows and anarchy rises. That is what the Joker represents!! No morals, no apparent motives, other than the destruction of the social network. In ""Batman begins"" Ra's Al Ghoul wanted to create a new order of justice through chaos. Joker goes one step further. He wants to establish chaos itself as the new order. The world is in a state of chaos anyway. Crime rules and the only one willing to fix things and give people the justice they deserve is a man dressed up as a bat!! Congratulations! This is an idea worth watching on screen! Why stay true to the cartooned image of previous Batmen when you can explore such a brilliant idea? And the film is filled with several plot twists, agonizing dilemmas and very meaningful dialogue. Of course there are minor flaws plot-wise. Sometimes the various events are a little confusing. The Scarecrow's cameo appearance is out of place. He should have a larger part in the film or not at all. The ""mutation"" of Harvey Dent into Twoface near the end of the movie should have been explored more and at a slower pace. If there is one more film to complete a trilogy with Twoface as the main villain, I would be content.The directing by Christopher Nolan is fast-paced and tight. The movie stretches to 2,5 hours, but in such a relentless pace that in the end all you want is more!! The only objection is that some action scenes near the end are a little too chaotic. You can't really make out what's happening. But, others could object that that's the way Batman works! The villains can't really make out what exactly hit them (in the end it's all a matter of taste).I've left the acting for last, because of the hype surrounding Heath Ledger's portrait of the Joker. Well, the rumors are true: Heath Ledger is breathtaking. His Joker is so believable and realistic that sometimes you think that the actor actually IS a homicidal psychopath and not just acting!! The comparison to any other actor in this movie is completely out of place. Heath Ledger is in a league of his own. And that is extra credit to him considering that the rest of the cast did a fantastic job also. My personal favourites were Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. Michael Caine should have more screen time though. Least favourite was Maggie Gylenhaal. Contrary to the general opinion I preferred Katie Holmes. But overall the performances were outstanding. Christian Bale is left for last: This is my favourite vision of Batman. Bale continues the work he did in ""Batman begins"". He creates a character complete in every way, but in this film he somewhat lacks the emotional strength he had in ""Batman begins"".Overall, ""The Dark Knight"" is a complex crime drama of epic proportions, filled with fast and banging action scenes, ingenious storyline and brilliant acting by an all-star cast lead by a monumental performance by the late Heath Ledger. His Joker is not only the best comic-book-villain-on-film, but also one of the best villains in the history of the film industry. Whether or not he'll get an Oscar is totally irrelevant. After all Jack Nicholson never won an Oscar for his Joker... (Who by the way should not be compared with Ledger's Joker, because the logic behind each role is different. With Christopher Nolan behind the camera an actor as great as Jack Nicholson could have pulled off something similar or better. You can never know.)"
7602,True,"like many other posts here, i was so looking forward to this having thought that batman begins was after the first two superman films the best comic adaptation so far. what a let down, i agree with all the folk that said the film has no plot is repetitous and without any depth. of course the critics are all going to be sheep again it has already started, wow how dark this is, this word has been so overused to describe anything thats not light and fluffy and has now lost its meaning. this film just does not engage in any emotional way whatsoever. in going for realism nolan has lost any sense of wonder and fantasy that the previous film had. that had proper comic book villains well portrayed, the joker here is one dimensional had a problem dad and now just wants to destroy batman and everything else. i think we have had quite enough of this villain, lets put him to rest. this was going to be my film of the year, but like so many others my anticipation was blown away by mediocrity, mr. nolan please take note of the negative criticisms here, these are written by true fans of you and your films so far you have delivered with your previous films but now seem to have gone astray. get your scripts tighter, the film was at least a half hour to long, and really had nothing to say or to entertain."
7603,True,"So this movie has been mega-hyped and I did see it on opening day. I enjoyed it, though I'm not sure I'd sit through it again. First, the positive points. There is nice eye-candy for the female movie-goer in Bale and Eckhart. The performances all around are stellar. Obviously, Ledger's Joker is amazing. I personally found it to be one of the best performances I've seen in an actor (this may be ironic but I found it as chilling as Nicholson's role in The Shining). He was superb and I found myself waiting for the scenes in which he would reappear. I also though Gary Oldman did some very nice work. His performance was restrained in the right places and emotionally wrought in others. Eckhart and Caine were really terrific in their roles as well. Freeman played the same character he always does and that was fine. Maggie Gyllenhaal was unwatchable. Horrible acting on a horribly written character. And I don't mean to be rude, but she is way too homely looking for the viewer to believe uber-hotties would be lusting after her. She was terrible.The negatives: The movie is way too long. I found it uncomfortably long. Bale's Batman voice grated on my nerves. I appreciate the intensity and artistic style of this movie, but it just wasn't a whole lot of fun. It was dark, heavy, brooding, and a bit depressing. Recommended but not loved."
7604,True,"Being one of about three people who didn't like Nolan's ""Memento"" I know I will be in the minority on not liking ""The Dark Knight"". But here goes. I thought this movie was awful. It was boring. And when it wasn't boring it was pretentious. And when it wasn't pretentious it didn't make any sense. It has to be one of the most poorly edited films I've seen. There always seemed to be three things happening at once and every time one event became involving, the movie would cut away (on an action no less)to a second or third event until you weren't sure which event was happening where and when. Not only was this completely confusing, it undercut the tension in any one of the single events. The action sequences, where Batman is actually involved in a fight or a car chase are so mangled they are drained of all excitement. The fistfights are too close-up and choppy and the motorcycle/truck chase is all over the screen with no continuity or point of view. It's a total mess. So is the overall plot. It tries so hard to be ""complex"" it defeats itself on a dramatic level. It's trying to thwart audience expectations, but you know, sometimes audience expectations should be honored. Aren't super-hero movies supposed to be fun? This is about as much fun as walking barefoot through an open landfill. When I think about it, the answer to that question is ""no"". Arguably, The Terminator is a super-hero and he isn't much fun. But the first two Terminators were fun;and they were as dark as could be. The rest of these comments are just random thoughts I had, watching the movie. They are disjointed and perhaps non-sensical, but then, so was the movie. The Dark Knight completely lacks a sense of humor, unless you count the Joker's insanity. Heath Ledger was great at first, but his ""Crazy"" act became repetitive and started to grate after ten minutes. There's not a single likable character, or actor to play them. And the Gotham Police Department seems to have recruited it's staff from a local home for the mentally challenged. Why are Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Alfie in this? Couldn't they throw a bone to some struggling unknown actors and let them play these disposable roles? Maggie Gyllenhaal has all the appeal of a bruised cantaloupe. I was routing for her to die. When did Batman start disguising his voice by talking like Astro from the Jetson's. Like people really aren't going to recognize the bottom half of his face anyway? Wouldn't Harvey Dent's facial burns require at least a little Solarcaine to keep from getting infected and killing him? How did the Joker manage to pay for all that gasoline before he robbed the bank? The only scene I thought was good was when the Joker pushed Maggie off of the Wayne building and Batman swooped down to save her. Maybe because it reminded me of the same scene from Superman? What I hated most was all the holier than thou (Batman!) moral posturing by the filmmakers when they are marketing this disturbingly violent picture to kids. And then they have a little boy on screen being threatened with a gun to the head. It's pretty sick. People in this movie are brutally murdered and physically threatened usually by gun, or by knife, and even by a pencil. The theater where I saw this was packed with little kids. THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN."
7605,True,"This was a good movie...I have seen many lauding it as the best ever, but don't be fooled. The death of Heath Ledger, who played a magnificent Joker to be sure, is the only reason that this movie is getting such hype in the rankings. Its as if every secret rainbow card carrying closet case lost their gay crush and have to rate this movie as the best ever. It isn't the best movie ever.There I said it. This is not the best movie ever. It is a good very passable summer action blockbuster but that's it. If it wasn't so disjointed introducing Two-Face and killing off the lead lady it perhaps could have been the greatest movie ever. But please stop the madness. Heath is dead we get it you are upset. Don't overrate a directors work because of the last masterful performance of one great actor.Thanks."
7606,True,"Wow, saw the movie yesterday and must say I was completely disappointed in the whole thing. I enjoy action movies - Transformers, Superman, Spiderman - basically every comic known to the world and the common theme that good does indeed win over evil. Not in this movie- The DA Dent - the hero figure was bent into an evil monster. The heroine - blown to bits. Batman at the end a criminal hunted by the police ............. the notion - either you die a hero or stick around long enough to be the villain........ yup that is pretty much this whole movie. Batman was one dimensional. I did enjoy MC's Alfred but for me that was the bright spot as well as Morgan being the one that had morals. The scene where the boat captives had to choose - totally unbelievable - crazy convict would do the right thing ........ right. It is a twisted version .... a once great comic hero that now is a - should I do this or not type of guy. As in Jerry Maguire .... that is NOT what inspires people. It was a disturbing movie that I wished I had skipped."
7607,True,"Here's the thing, I like to read what is on IMDb and gauge what other people think about films, it'd be healthy debate if it weren't for the anonymity and venom. The one thing that kills me about IMDb is the haters and you know who you are.If you wrote ""WORST MOVIE EVER"" in the summary or any part of the text, if you talk about how ""everyone"" in the theatre ""looked"" disgruntled, if you use terms like ""character development"", ""Cliche"" or other terms that you really don't have the right to use unless you work as a reviewer for a reputable newspaper (no websites DO NOT count, unless they pay per word) and finally you are a HATER if you vote low because you don't agree with the ranking ""I would normally give this film 6/10 but because of the ridiculous voting on IMDb, i'm giving it 1/10"". You are purposefully sabotaging a film because you have something against it, believe it's over hyped or whatever. That is wrong. Holding up 'The Godfather' and 'Pulp Fiction' doesn't change the fact that people legitimately like this film. They don't vote 10 because they are idiots, or lack motor functions or any other insult you deem ""necessary"". They are fans of a particular film, it doesn't matter which one, but they are fans. Get over yourselves, stop ruining people's ability to enjoy a film, regardless of what problems you have with it.As for the film, I thought it was great, I've seen it twice. I might even see it a third time just to try and find all those plot holes the haters have so unkindly pointed out.Heath was great, forget Nicholson's campy portrayal and forget Caesar Romero. I don't say that because I am a fan of Heath Ledger or because he is dead, 75% of his films I cannot watch, in fact it might be more. Two Hands is the only film of his, off the top of my head, that I actually like.I have two small problems with the film: 1. The new batsuit made Batman seem less imposing and the symbol was too small. 2. The way in which Harvey Dent died, i don't have a problem with the end, through the whole film Alfred kept saying that Batman could be hated and he sacrificed Batman's status as a hero to keep Harvey Dent's image as the ""white knight"" intact.I gave the film 10/10, not to bump it up and not because i'm an idiot as some haters like to suggest. I liked the film and think that 10/10 is what it's worth. Haters, you might be a majority on IMDb, but you're a minority in the world, maybe that's why 'The Dark Knight' is marching toward $925 million world wide."
7608,True,"I went into this film expecting it to be amazing. I read most of the reviews on IMDb and people are wowed and amazed at the excellence of the film. I fail to share this amazement. And to suggest this is the best film ever made beating greats like the Godfather and the shawshank redemption.First of all batman plays a minor role in the whole film. He Occasionally appears. And when he does a stupid voice that sounds like he needs some cough medicine just gets more irritating every time you hear it. Bruce Wayne Played batman with no enthusiasm, just a boring, bland character. On the other hand Heath Ledger did play the Joker very well which is some constellation to the film.Second of all when they rob the bank at the beginning the school bus pinpoints the robber to hit and still manages to drive away after smashing thought a 10 inch thick wall. Then the police which are about 100m away fail to see the school bus drive out ? And the scene where Batman's suit can be penetrated by dogs but not by bullets ? This is ridiculous.Near the end rocket launchers are fired at the police van batman is being contained in. After Numerous shots there isn't even a dent in the side of it. In Iraq armed tanks can be blow up with a simple rocket launcher but an armoured police van cannot ? And a plane manages to attach itself to a thin piece of wire without ripping it to shreds ? The joker blows up a hospital but gave warning for some reason, did it in broad daylight ? The police are two miles away for safety but it would all make too much sense to have a helicopter or a bomb disposal unit on site ? The Final thing that actually made me laugh was the way he invented sonar to access phones. How could you possibly invent something like that in a couple of days !!! This Film was just a joke and I really cant see how people can suggest its going to threaten titanic as the biggest box office film ever.A Stupid Unbelievable Film that uses no common sense at all ."
7609,True,"The good:This movie was an improvement over the juvenile and cartoon like depiction of batman from the prior series.The action was good. Heath Ledger did a great job as the joker. There was some decent character development on him.I liked the cameo in the movie to the original TV comic TV series.The bad:Batman is not a comic (as in funny) figure, however that doesn't mean the movie has to be devoid of comedy to give peaks and valleys to the violence and disturbing trip down the dark shaft of the criminally insane that Batman journeys to.The movie was as dry as a martini with humor. You wont find it.Batman's voice when he has his cowl on is extremely annoying. It sounds like someone trying to talk tough who isn't.No further character development of Bruce Wayne. The original Batman actually did a better job with this.The whole fake death of commissioner Gordon seem forced into the plot like a square peg in a round whole.Again, the movie makers depart from the Comic strip and kill off the Joker. Batman and the Joker are linked and in the comic book he goes through a deal of effort to make sure he lives.Out of the three comic book to screen adaptations this summer: Batman, Iron Man, and the Hulk. The Hulk is best."
7610,True,"In reality, I give this film a score of ""4 out of 10"", but the one-star rating you see above is intended to balance out the obvious shill vote (marketing hype, ""astroturf"", 10/10 votes and comments by paid-for marketing weenies posing as real, unbiased people).At the time of this writing, the film has a 9.7-out-of-10 rating which it clearly does not in any sense deserve. It merits half that rating.I saw ""Batman"" last night. 2.5 hours meant that one gets one's money's worth, but heck... it's not half as good as advertisers and IMDb.com would have us believe. The plot line drags, the characters are shallow, the morality is deeply confused and wildly warped.The ""dark knight"" is more like a dim bulb.It's hard to believe in Heath Ledger as the Joker. He's just too broad in the face, one-dimensional in this role, and weighed down by poor writing. His makeup was supposed to be degrading throughout the film, but there were obvious touch-ups and clean-ups that reminded the audience ""this is make-believe."" His garb was supposed to be purple-on-green, but was so dark as to look like a black suit. His actions were so reckless that we, as an audience, were constantly reminded that ""this ain't even close to reality. Even a toddler wouldn't believe that this scheme would leave The Joker alive and thriving.""Worse, we're given zero back-story to help us believe that The Joker's feelings and craziness are based on something. In fact, the film goes far out of its way to emphasize that The Joker has no past, no legitimate reason for his hatred and aggression, and is simply not understandable. To that, I say ""Go back to scriptwriting school, and take a few psychology classes while you're there. A character isn't menacing or intriguing unless we see the mechanism driving the emotions.""Worse, Christian Bale as Batman. Christian Bale, though good at dieting and working out, has all the humanity and emotiveness of rotting firewood. Without a sound track, sure, he'd do well as a male model. As a actor, though, he's just taking up space on the screen. Worse, his lisping (with obvious sound effects to lower and strengthen his voice) make him unbelievable as Batman and as perfectionist billionaire.Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) gave an unemotive performance. Worse, he seemed to be struggling with his accent so much that he had no time for other aspects of acting. This is NOT the caliber of performance that he delivered for ""Leon"" (""The Professional"") and ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"". This was an obvious potboiler, walk-on-and-take-the-money performance.Likewise for all the other performers except hyperactive Heath Ledger and a small one-dimensional part played by the wife of one character. I felt no emotion from any of the other actors and actresses, despite the big ups and downs in the plot line. Dammit, if your daddy dies or you quit your lifelong job, y'oughta look a little broken up!With two exceptions, the special effects did nothing for me: 1) I felt a bit of adrenalin when Batman was standing on a ledge atop a skyscraper while the camera looked over his shoulder into the street. 2) Harvey Two-face's mask was well done: that gets a thumbs up, though I wouldn't want kids seeing it or they'll have nightmares.A few scenes just left me scratching my head, saying ""that would never happen; that's beyond stupid, even for a cartoon movie."" When Batman glides down from one building on his wings, darn it, the wings should look full of air like a parachute, not luffing like a sail pointed in the wrong direction!Even the love interest was a bit bland. They found a frumpy, not-too-pretty woman to play Batman's love-of-his-life, and apparently asked her to play her role as though nothing-- romance, impending death, and explosions-- matters. I've seen people react more strongly when they get the wrong kind of coffee from a Starbucks! >:oThe morality is twisted. From a comic book, one should expect flat, one-dimensional thinking. From Frank Miller, the talented artist but stupid Ayn Rand follower who wrote the comic book on which this film is based, one should expect wildly offensive ""morality"" that would make even an idiot say ""wtf, man, rethink this!"" The plot and characters will inevitably be compared to America's McCarthyist-style ""war on terrorism"", and that just sickens me, because I see the film try to justify a patronizing, lying, violent attitude from government and a billionaire.Everywhere in the film, actors are saying ""This is wrong-headed, illegal, untruthful, patronizing to the citizenry, and an abuse of power... but we're in a dark, scary time so it's OK for now."" Art imitates life, eh! I felt deeply ill.So far this summer, Hancock is the only superhero movie I'd endorse, and that would only get a weak thumbs-up. It's at least funny, and does not try to paint a comic-book morality as ""heroic"".So what SHOULD you see as an action/popcorn movie this summer? I'm wondering if the ""Voyage to the Center of the Earth"" film or the new Mummy film, both starring Brendan Frasier, will be a bit better... or at least have a few funny lines. The trailers, though, hint that they'll be campy and unbelievable."
7611,True,"Last night I went to see what I thought was going to be a Superhero movie. I left the theater feeling betrayed. Warner Brothers and D.C. comics tricked me into going to see a shitty, 3 hour cop movie/crime drama.I was prepared for a movie with a darker tone even than 2005's Batman Begins. I really enjoyed Batman Begins. It had the splendor and wonder one expects from a superhero movie, while introducing a deeper, more adult atmosphere. The Dark Knight keeps the adult, but loses the splendor.My issues with this film are numerous, so we'll begin with what I knew about it going in. They shot this film on location in Chicago. Gotham City is more than just a city. It carries with it a certain imagery of over the top Gothic architecture. It is shiny on the top, and seedy on the bottom. This imagery was present in Tim Burton's films, as well as Batman Begins. The Dark Knight's Gotham City just looks like....Chicago. As a frequent visitor to the windy city I even found myself, during the film, calling out tourist locations.Director Christopher Nolan made this creative choice to ground his audience in a certain reality, but guess what? I didn't go to see Batman for reality. I went to see a fantasy film. That it took place in a city I've been to took me out of the fantasy.Secondly, this movie is too long. At nearly three hours, I found myself staring at the ceiling and making ""get on with it already"" hand motions. From a story telling perspective, this movie has six acts. Count them SIX! There's a first act, and a second, but then the story devolves with four third acts. First they catch the Joker, then he gets away then they have to save Harvey and what's her name, then The Joker blows up a hospital then The Joker is going to blow up some boats. Choose one! Choose one of those third acts and you have a winner. But Four?Prolonging the film even more, is the Harvey Dent B-story that doesn't even start until after the second third act. This plot really needed to be the next film in the series. Dent is a complex character, and Two-Face could have been a great main villain. But, stuck away in a movie about The Joker, the character was wasted. He only had one scene (as Two Face) with Batman, and by the time Two-Face was introduced, I was already ready to leave the theater already.The aspect of The Dark Knight that made me truly realize how much I hated it is the violence. Two scenes in particular stand out. Once, Batman has to stop some S.W.A.T. team members from shooting some innocent people dressed as The Joker's henchmen. Instead of saying ""Hey guys don't shoot the clowns!"" He beats them up and strings them from a rope over the 30th story of a skyscraper. Are you kidding me? This Batman always takes the more violent way out (short of guns and killing of course).The scene that almost made me walk out had Two-Face jamming a revolver in the earlobe of Commissioner Gordon's kid. Come on! I hate censorship but are we really a society that has fantasy movies where we threaten to kill kids? I want to see superhero movies with my kids, but my step-son will be 21 before he's able to watch this. Gimme a break! While I've been typing this I've seen 3 Batman related commercials on Nickelodeon. So are you making a movie for kids? You're advertising to them, and pointing guns at their brains.The worst part about this film, and the thing that I keep harping on, is that it is not fantasy. It is not a superhero movie. It is a cop drama. The Joker is kind out of control, and Batman wears a suit, but otherwise its just an action movie starring Vin Diesel. ""But Pirate Ninja, this is more like the comic books."" Well, those comic books suck.Okay, they may not suck, but if the writers at D.C. have decided to change Batman from a superhero then they have made a grave mistake. The ""the comic books"" you're talking about started in 1986, but the Batman character dates back to 1939. So you tell me which is a better representation of the character.I like superhero movies. I do not like cop dramas. I do not like shoot-em-up, blow-em-up action flicks. I feel like I have been duped into spending money on a film that I would not have gone to had it not had a character named Batman.Through all this panning I do have to say I did enjoy the acting in this film. Christian Bale is alright, Heath Ledger was phenomenal (as all accounts indicate) Aaron Eckhart was great, Maggie Gyllenhaal brought more to her performance as what's her name than Katie Cruise did, and even Morgan Freeman had more to do this time, including a moral choice."
7612,True,"To be honest, the first time I saw this movie, I was swept away by it. Everything about it left in absolute awe, and I remember distinctly thinking there was nothing that would ever come close to being that good. However, upon watching the film a second and third time, the sheen came off. Apparently, I'm one of only a few for whom that occurred.I'll get it out of the way, Heath Ledger, remained and will always remain perfect in this movie. In no way could he have done better. Any less than an Oscar would be a complete let down.The rest of the main cast however, is what pushed me away from enjoying the film again. Upon another viewing, I can't at all stand even listening to Maggie Gyllenhaal deliver her lines. She's painful to watch at all times, particularly in the scene where she's about to meet her demise, I could hardly contain myself when it finally occurred. Eckhart is excellent. Until he's required to be two-face. Then it all goes to shambles. I can't explain why, but it just happens. Finally, Batman. Great performance. Honestly. However, Bale's voice (again with line delivery!) is ridiculous. It seems as though it was thought that if they were to have him talk through an elaborate set of tree trunks, it would add that much more depth to the film.Ultimately, I can still see the movie for what it's worth, and the concept is no doubt a work of genius. However in attempting to present such a concept, I'm also left with a sense of annoyance. The movie is indeed impressive, and it's plot quite intriguing. However, by no means is this film as flawless as the countless masses would have EVERYONE believe."
7613,True,"First of all, sorry for this late comment, but i wanted to write a review on The Dark Knight as my first one.This film is the kind of films anyone could watch over a hundred times. Written and directed exceptionally well by Christopher Nolan, this 152 min. action-packed thriller is completely superb.With awesome dialogues delivered by the actors, especially the Joker(Heath Ledger)and surprisingly Alfred(Micheal Caine), the film keeps you engrossed all the time. No matter which scene is going on, you can certainly expect something unexpected.The action sequences are amazing especially the scene where Batman is getting Lau back from China.The late Heath Ledger delivers a flawless performance. Christian Bale is awesome as well. Gary Oldman is good too. Aaron Eckhart and Morgan Freeman do their best too.Certainly deserving the prestigious Oscar this year, The Dark Knight is possibly the best movie in the history of Hollywood."
7614,True,"If Batman is the untamed world, The Joker is the unbalanced world. THE DARK KNIGHT tells us humanity lives somewhere in between. In Christopher Nolan's sequel to BATMAN BEGINS, we hit the ground running, cape flouncing dramatically, cowl turned sideways so we can only see through one eye-hole; claustrophobic scream rising as Gotham City is terrorized by The Joker, while the Batman, Commissioner Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent join forces to stop him at the cost of lives, ethics, reputations... as simple as this outline reads, director-writer Nolan and co-writer, Jonathan Nolan, have elevated this comic book tale to tragedy on an operatic scale. Christian Bale is once again Batman/Bruce Wayne, all muscled arms and intense quietude; Michael Caine, his loyal butler, Alfred; Morgan Freeman is technocrat Lucius Fox, who delineates the ethics slur that Batman commits (a grave nod to the Amerikan FISA bill); mighty Gary Oldman is Commissioner Gordon; hourglass Maggie Gyllenhaal thankfully replaces dull Katie Holmes as Assistant D.A., Rachel Dawes; Aaron Eckhart makes a killer Harvey Dent, tragically transmogrified into Two-Face; and - let me do that Hannibal Lecter thing when he talks about Chianti - there is... The Joker....Why So Sneerious? The tragedy mounts its gargoyle perch, as Gotham realizes too late that only a city overseen by a caped vigilante would be prone to inspire villains as flamboyant as its protector. For the first time on film since his appearance in graphic novels in 1940, The Joker is the heart attack Cadillac hell-on-wheels insanitarium he was always envisioned to be. And Heath Ledger - in his swansong performance before his untimely death - does not go gentle into that good night. Was it ever imagined that someone on this earth could out-Jack Jack? And what mad fate that that one man would leave this earth after his most throat-slicing role... Heath Ledger's kamikaze performance as The Joker runs this movie on a scalpel-edge, a role so black and purple and psycho-delicious, it turns our hair green with pus. His origins are never explained, his motives are never explored - ""Some men just want to watch the world burn."" First scenes pay homage to the ""Sons of The Batman,"" where do-gooder impostors don Batman's cowl and cape to bring vigilante justice to their corner of Gotham. After this pat action beginning, The Joker rears his painted head. And everything gets pear-shaped. We meet The Joker in a convoluted bank robbing scene, where double-crosses and triple-crosses against his own henchmen illustrate exactly how saw-toothed the cogs of The Joker's plans are. He plays by no rules, thriving on the chaos he creates from the tripwire of civilized society. With his psychological profile lifted from the graphic novel BATMAN: THE KILLING JOKE - ""All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy"" - The Joker launches a plot to undermine the underworld as well as the over world. His plots are plans within plans,moral ambiguities piled upon moral turpitude. Playing humanity's dark side against its gray side.Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne operates from a giant subterranean crawlspace, trying to keep Batman's name free of scandal and to simultaneously protect Gotham from The Joker's demolition smile. In this reality-based world, vigilantes are a mixed blessing, as Harvey Dent walks a tightrope of tolerance for Batman. Meanwhile, Bruce's love interest, Rachel Dawes, is Spanking Panties with Harvey right in front of Bruce, which drives him batty. At one point, Bruce almost gives up being Batman for the sake of Rachel's spank, because it truly looks like Harvey is making headway in cleaning up Gotham. In not being bought or negotiated with, Dent has become Gotham's ""White Knight."" Then The Joker happens...This is not a simple film by any means and the moral dilemmas each protagonist is made to face by The Joker are astoundingly well-crafted.Dent is injured during a rescue, half his face chemically burning off, but his resulting ""split-personality"" as Two-Face is not the simplistic madness of Tommy Lee Jones, but the moral ambiguity of an avenger for justice who has seen both sides of the good/evil fence - and they're both the same but for *one bad day!* The Joker - in playing good against evil - unwittingly achieved a poetic symmetry in Dent.Batman resorts to spying on Gotham's citizens via their cellphones, to pick up possible transmissions from the Joker and locate him. Lucius resents this intrusion of privacy and quits. This is not ""just"" a superhero movie - oh, it's got all the action you could want - that Bat-Hummer thrashes through traffic and then births a spiffy Bat-Bike; Batman swooshes through the night and delivers chest-kicks aplenty, and a hospital goes kablooey! - but THE DARK KNIGHT questions everything ABOUT heroes, and takes itself just as seriously as The Joker doesn't. In a sad irony, Ledger's Joker lifts another allusion from THE KILLING JOKE when he tells Batman they are ""destined to be doing this forever."" The Joker's fate in the movie is ambiguous, left hanging upside down from a skyscraper girder, cackling, as always, as if in on a joke that only HE gets. As Batman burdens himself with the sins of Gotham and White Knight Dent, so that society won't crumble when their belief in heroes is shaken, Gary Oldman's words ring the messianic outro, to the question his son asks, ""Why must he run?"": ""...Because he's not a hero. He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector, a dark knight."""
7615,True,"I finally got to see the movie I have been excited about since the end of Batman Begins and I must say it was everything I expected. Great acting, wonderful production designs, and a superb script mix to make more than your average comic book movie. However, I would not go so far as to call this ""the greatest movie of all time."" It merely raises the bar in its own genre.While it's an all around excellent film I can't help but point out its flaws. But please, spare me the insults; this is nothing more than mere nit picking.Confusingly shot and plainly choreographed action scenes fail to recapture the magic of Batman (1989) and Batman: Forever. There wasn't a point throughout the film where I was awed or wished I was Batman. I found myself having trouble getting into them and even began looking around the theater when they occurred.The story, as mentioned before, is well done, unfortunately the fall of Harvey Dent and the subsequent rise of Two Face felt tacked on. Not to mention the villain/ tragic hero's disappointing amount of screen time. As a fan I was devastated when he fell to his death. It's in this writer's opinion it was definitely something that should have been explored in its own film.When the movie was over I couldn't help but feel it was a tad bit crowded, the movie definitely lost its focus at times. But don't get me wrong everything that happened in the story was interesting; it was just a lot to digest.Everyone gave strong performances except for The Dark Knight himself. Christian Bale's screen presence was weak with the exception of the Joker interrogation scene and the final confrontation with Two Face. As I said before there was not one point where I wished I was Batman.Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance as Rachael Dawes was so-so but she wasn't given much to work with.And now for the praise. The Dark Knight follows in the footsteps of Batman Begins as a more intelligent and logical breed of super hero movie; It comes close to being a sophisticated crime drama. Whether it's gadgets or emotions they are all believable.Aaron Eckhart is perfect as Gotham's dashing and fearless District Attorney, Harvey Dent. The way he plays off his alter ego, Two face, is also perfect. Expect to sympathize with this character.Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker totally reinvented the character as well as our conception of the actor himself. His mannerisms and lines will be imitated for years to come, long after Jack's interpretation is forgotten. Also Director Christopher Nolan's choice of not revealing the character's origin's gave him an eerie almost super natural quality. I applaud his choice.Props must also be given to the designers who worked on the joker. They managed to make Ledger look distinct from Nicolson while retaining the joker's trade mark green hair, makeup, and purple suit. The concept of his knife collection also adds a more gruesome element to the character.It must also be said Gary Oldman is Jim Gordon, period! The story is above average and deeper than most comic book movies. Some of the situations and there following consequences fit together so well it's hard to believe it's a Batman movie.The atmosphere of paranoia the story fosters is engulfing; you really begin to fear for the characters. No one is safe from the joker's lethal brand of humor, not even the police.The ending is another bright spot in this already glowing script. Batman's decision to take the blame for Harvey's crimes while refusing to kill the Joker make him a true hero, who will bare any burden to ""bring Gotham back."" It also sets up an interesting conflict for the third installment.When all is said and done this movie is worth seeing if only to see a comic book movie done right. Solid acting, writing, and directing make this a sharp movie. However average action, a crowded story, and a long run time may deter the casual movie goer.I eagerly await the final movie."
7616,True,"As much of an improvement that Batman Begins was from the previous movies, this one was an improvement over Batman Begins. I thought this was a very good movie. Heath Ledger was excellent as the Joker. His portrayal was a far cry from anything he has done before. The movie was very dark and creepy. I read a Dark Knight graphic novel once and this was very close to that feeling of creepiness. Maggie Gyllenhaal was a much better cast as Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes. Her portrayal was much more believable in an adult role.The only flaw I saw in the movie was two-face. This was a far improved performance from the Tommy Lee Jones character from Batman Forever. Mr. Jones is a good actor, he couldn't help how badly it was written. Aaron Eckhart was more convincing. The problem I had was with the grotesque CG effects of his face. It was a little over the top. No one would be able to survive if their face was that badly damaged.I would give the movie a 9.5 if possible, but I'm okay with giving it a 10."
7617,True,"I will tell you right now that I completely ruined this film for myself. That's not to say that I didn't love it but this film might be one of the most hyped up, advertised, and talked about film of all time and 99% of it all was nothing but sheer greatness so you go into the film with high expectations which the film doesn't have any problem meeting. My problem was, despite the fact that I LOVE Batman (next only to Superman), grew up adoring everything about him, loved the movies until the disgustingly deplorable Batman and Robin, but I was determined to be critical of this film. I knew it would be great but I wanted to find the flaws in the bat armor and truth be told I'm not sure I could find any but constantly looking for it ruined the true greatness of this movie for me. Honestly I could write about this movie for pages and pages which is the sign of a great film. On top of that I almost wish I could with hold this review until I've seen the movie again and I will see it again!! Although a sequel of sorts with familiar cast members and Chris Nolan taking up the helm as director it absolutely stands on it's own merits and resembles more of a starting film that is pure brilliance but certainly Nolan gives loyal fans familiar tie ins from his original movie Batman Begins. The one thing I can be critical of in this film, is that while Heath Ledger is terrific as the Joker as everyone says he is, there are some equal if not surpassing performances by other members of the cast who are getting shafted.It seems this time around star Christian Bale is getting a bit of flack for his flawless portrayal of the man with dual identities. I think Bale is absolutely brilliant, completely built for this role and makes it near impossible for anyone to ever portray The Dark Knight OR Bruce Wayne ever again. He plays both sides so remarkably that you truly can't tell he is both characters. His overtly raspy voice as Batman is perfect, dead on, and adds an heir of darkness and mystery to The Dark Knight that was all about gone in the second installment of Tim Burton's Batman. The late Heath Ledger plays the best Joker ever to come from the pages of the comic book. I adore Jack Nicholson but his Joker wasn't the Joker that we all knew from the comic book. Joker was meant to be deranged, disturbed, twisted, brilliant, cold, and evil. Ledger embodies all of that and makes you squirm when he's on screen. He literally brings the joker to life and kudos to him for his final performance. He does deserve the acclaim he is getting. That being said Aaron Eckhart is just as, if not better, in his role as legal crusader Harvey Dent and later the twisted Two Face character. Eckhart should be nominated right along with Ledger AND Bale because he is amazing. He holds your attention and his performance as Two Face is far too short lived!! Gary Oldman is also incredible in his role as Commissioner Gordon, very under rated I think. Maggie Gyllenhaal is okay as Rachel Dawes but certainly no better or worse than Katie Holmes was. The amazing Morgan Freeman seems to give a half hearted and much less involved performance as Lucius Fox. I think this most definitely will be his last go around in the Nolan's Batman series. Although he doesn't have a big role I'm still trying to figure out how Eric Roberts ended up in the potentially biggest film of all time??!! The Dark Knight is the most unique super hero film ever made. It truly defines a Superhero epic. It's not so much an action film as it is an intense, dark drama about Batman. It really is the definitive Batman film and as much as I love sequels Nolan would be smart to end things right now because the odds of coming even close to this installment would be astronomical. Now the bad side...I hate the Batmobile or tumbler or whatever it's called. The new Batbike was okay but the scene with him driving up the wall was ridiculous and made me shake my head in disgust. I mean in such an epic well made movie how can you toss something in there so bad?! It felt like it was done on purpose. The Dark Knight is everything Batman should be and felt like it was very true to the comics and to the character. Certainly they didn't hold back how dark it was with some genuinely disturbing scenes and I was sure Two Face and whatever make up job they did would be disappointing and I couldn't have been more wrong. It was incredible and actually made me cringe when I saw it. Now let's talk Joker because obviously he is the focal point of much discussion and potential Oscar buzz. The Joker is phenomenal and everything you would expect from Batman's infamous nemesis. One of the greatest scenes in the film is Bale as Batman interrogating Ledger's Joker in the jail...just phenomenal. And when you think it's over...it's not even close to over. Ledger's Joker is disturbing and downright evil. The scene right from the bat (no pun intended) with Joker and his ""magic trick"" sets the tone for what this Joker is all about. Any way you look at it this just put a bar on superhero films that few others will ever touch. Go see this now no matter what you like because it can't disappoint and you'll leave breathless!! 9.5/10"
7618,True,"I believe the this movie exceeds in 40 minutes. It's conflicts far beyond the story of Batman versus Joker in the new and ephemeral villain: two-face.Sometimes folks comic superheroes don't have the meat needed for such a big sandwich. If you love explosions and big cars you'll hate this review but:The Story of this Batman is not powerful enough to gain the Dramatic-Epic- Semishakesperean intentions of the second and third act.The joker is amazing cause he really makes you laugh at his cruelty, Comissioner Gordon demonstrates the admirable interpretation gamma of Mr Oldman but... what tires me after 2 hours?-the deep throaty voice of batman... after one hour is irritating... -the complex schemes and evil... after an hour are incomprehensive-the growing presence of extensive monologues on darkness and light...make you indifferent... complement and explaining an ongoing confusion... i can remind you... movies are mainly visual and you need a great craft for Shakespeare... the best example is the ""dog chasing cars"" text... great metaphor that survives a mass of intellectually rounded up script.I hope one day Clint Eastwood will interpret batman in the best batman story ever:the Dark Knight Returns(frank miller)... directed by David Lynch. And i'll take credit on that one for gos'd sake!! (A 60 year old batman returns to Gotham...)"
7619,True,"Batman insisted to create a white-lie to protect the white knight image of Harvey Dent, he said, ""Sometimes, truth isn't good enough, sometimes people deserve more. Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded."" Christopher Nolan wrote into the script the citizens' refusal to detonate the other boat's bomb for the same purpose, for us.In Memento, Nolan has the presumed hero fall when the test came, deciding to live on a lie just to preserve his own need to live. In this film, the only moral victory from the 'people' came from the two boats. But the ""good boat"" representative's final refusal to detonate is unconvincing, though plausible. What will we really do? I wonder if Nolan did that for us, to give us a little hope in ourselves though it might not be true."
7620,True,"This film is hands down, then best I have see in a long time. It is amazing. The acting is superb! Heath Ledger will forever be remembered, although it is such a shame that he is no longer around. He steals the show every time he is on the screen with his creepy presence and unforgettable high pitched laughter. Christian Bale is great and definitely a believable character. Maggie Gyllenhaal was far better than Katie Holmes, although it is still almost as if something is missing, but that is hardly going to upset the film. Aaron Eckhart really does an excellent job with Harvey ""Two-Face"" Dent, and still makes a pretty disturbing ""bad guy"" towards the end. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman really add to the whole movie, and the occasional laugh! Everybody else who was involved in this film deserves a round of applause and should be proud of themselves. It's a fabulous film and well worth the 2 hour and 32 minute run time. Long though it may seem, you will find yourself wishing it was longer because it feels far shorter than it really is. Overall, if you just need a film that's full of action and a great way to spend the better part of three hours, go to The Dark Knight!! It may be rather helpful, however, to watch Batman Begins beforehand, because The Dark Knight will make more sense. Excellent film and really cannot wait for the third Batman. (There has to be one!!! :])"
7621,True,"Well, one movie finally got me to post a comment on IMDb.Like everyone else says, this movie is fantastic. I won't repeat the gushing here.I only wanted to say that the story, and how it portrays the Archetypes of the Shadow, the Hero and the Trickster, is the best part of the movie. Christopher Nolan and his brother have created a true modern myth.I can't wait for the conclusion of the Trilogy.**************(Spoilers below)****************The Death of the Hero is one of the fundamental elements in mythology. For this reason I would think that Two-Face has to be dead. Now Batman (the Shadow) says he will become ""more than a Hero"" by taking the fall. Really, this can seen as a metaphor for simple maturity. PPPP."
7622,True,"Whoah! The current juggernaut that is The Dark Knight has been breaking records and causing fervor amongst movie goers and particularly, I see, voters here on IMDb. Is this really worth an average score on IMDb of 9.4 (as of July 30)? Of the top 10 highest rated movies on IMDb, does this deserve to be among them? I saw it in a packed movie theater, with a great cross-section of people, but mostly tweens, teens, and people up to around 30's, and at the end of it, rather than a big cheer, or round of applause or mumbling of contentment and positive comments there was just silence as every one left. I don't think it was a good stunned silence in awe of what they saw, more of a silence whilst we all wondered what the fuss was about.Is it a good movie? Yeah, but better than the first? Nah, not really, just as good but not mind blowingly better. So, what do I consider to be the reason the people I saw it with didn't think it was worth all the fuss? Well from here on in be spoilers.First off, it's too long. The first half zips along at a nice pace, but then from the point where Harvey Dent is burned and becomes Two-face, it drags on and on and on. Around 1 hour 20 the tweens in the audience started to get bored, around 1 hour 40 the teens started to get bored, and around 2 hours the rest of us started to wish it would end already! Also, talking of Two-face, a lot was said and hyped about how gruesome he looked. Nah, not at all. When the ""look"" was revealed, nobody screamed, some actually laughed at it, and the groups of girls behind us commented ""that looks stupid"". And what's with the need for so many villains in movies these days. The marketing campaign makes you think this is a Joker movie, so why bring Two-face into it, why isn't one bad guy enough? There's also a small appearance by Scarecrow too, which isn't really necessary. It's like they said ""Well, Spider-Man 3 had 3 villains, we must match that."" What about Heath Ledger as the Joker, is he as scary as people say? Is it as great a performance as people say? Well he's watchable, but better than Jack Nicholson's take on it? No, not for me. Not scary either really. I didn't feel this was a real madman at work. Worthy of an Oscar? No way man, I mean if you lost an Oscar to this guy for this performance you'd have to be seriously upset. It would be a gesture at best, and a political correctness one at that.It's been said that the movie was based on Heat, in the way the whole cop double cross story line pans out, but I'd say you can clearly see ideas from many movies in here. The whole last fight scene with the ""sonar vision"" reminded me of the ending of Daredevil, and neither of them are good scenes or easy to follow. The Hong Kong scene made me think of Mission: Impossible, and the whole scene about choosing who to save (Harvey Dent or Rachel Dawes) is similar to Spider-Man, and Batman 3, it's not a new concept and you also know what will happen because you've seen these scenes before.The action scenes are OK, but it's pretty hard to tell whats going on because of all the jump cutting, but the main thing is that Batman never really has a decent fight. He seems to dispatch the foes to easily, there's no struggle to any of his fights, and the action sequences are too short for me. They feel like they're setting up for one cool bit of action, but then they're over again and the final fight scene is a big monster of a fight scene either, it's not the best saved till last concept going on here, the best scene is half-way through with Batman on the Bat-bike chasing down the Joker in the truck.Finally, the story line. It's OK and all, but it's quite repetitive, as there are several separate scenes which spell out how we make a choice between good and evil, how we have to choose to be good. Yeah, we got it already the first time, and it's this repetition of this concept in the scenes that make the movie drag out.So, overall, is it a good movie? Yes, definitely watchable. Better than Batman Begins? No, not for me, if I had a choice to watch Batman Begins or the Dark Knight again, I'd choose Batman Begins. Best comic book movie adaptation ever, as I see one commentator say on here? Not the best, no, but better than most. Worth a 9.4 score on IMDb? NO WAY, that's the studio marketing machine driving that right now, I think it will come down when people calm down. Who knows, I'm sure studio people log on and push votes up, and I know I for one was waiting for this to come out and think it's one of the best movies to come out so far, but you need to not let that influence your voting. So, great movie, but not as great as people say, just don't go in expecting to see the greatest movie ever."
7623,True,"I went to see Dark Knight despite not being big fan of comic genre. I think I was influenced with high media and public anticipation of the movie and maybe even with the fact that the Heath Ledger is in it. Anyway, as the movie started I watched first few scenes and realized this movie is not my cup of tea. I couldn't relate to the characters in any way and could not care about what they do. I think this comic movie is so serious and pretending to take place in a real world, and it didn't work for me. In the end, it is just movie about superheroes, so why so much reality? As the movie continued, I end up feeling bored and couldn't wait for the movie to finish. The story seemed to go nowhere with more explosion and chaos and I couldn't figure out what it is all about. In comparison, lately I saw Iron Man and this movie works with the genre and thrill me from start to end with the simple concept and limited subject matter, not trying too hard as the Dark Knight does.The positive thing about the Dark Knight for me is the acting. All actors give good performance, but it doesn't safe the movie."
7624,True,"After seeing the film for the third time this evening, I've came to a solid conclusion. Most of the movies that we consider the best of all time contain a good amount of inner symbology. The Dark Knight not only has the simple symbol of the bat, but a plot that, to me, can easily be taken in as symbolizing the current America/Middle East situation. Joker of course being the terrorist, holding his own twisted beliefs on planning and chaos. Batman, meanwhile, representing the American government along with Harvey Dent. Most Americans don't agree with America's status in its war against terror and especially the PATRIOT ACT. Hmm....perhaps Batman using every cell phone within Gotham as a too to spot the Joker symbolizes the PATRIOT ACT and its infringement on our privacy???Most people didn't believe Batman was doing the right thing, however, he could indeed make the choice no other man could make as Alfred put it. This could easily symbolize our American Government and their great power and struggle to deal with the average Americans' feelings and beliefs. Batman indeed felt that he was doing the thing that would do the greatest amount of good for the greatest amount of people. However, it's clear in The Dark Knight that Batman is doing the right thing. But me being the liberal I am, I can't say I believe in what our government is doing....I would be interested to hear what the Nolan bros would have to say about this symbolism theory."
7625,True,"I'm not going to reiterate what's being said about Chris Nolan's new Batman film, ""The Dark Knight"". Just this: Years ago, I made a post on the Internet Movie Database regarding the new film ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". I titled the post ""Great, but not the second coming of cinema."" Well....I have seen the second coming of cinema, and it is ""The Dark Knight"".Amazing, absolutely amazing. Bale is a wonderful Batman, but Nicholson (as great as he is) has nothing on Ledger, and Tommy Lee Jones (one of my favs of all time) can't even hold a candle to Eckhart's turn as Two-Face."
7626,True,"When I saw this movie on Saturday, near the last 10 minutes I noticed a couple of people leaving the theater BEFORE the end of the movie. I thought- strange- but maybe they wanted to beat the rush on the typical parking lot gridlock. However, after my initial movie buzz wore off I considered that couple might have realized something before the rest of us rubes.Yes I gave it a 6/10, but that's only due to the separate components that must be acknowledged. The 'Dark Knight' as a whole, is a jumbled up mess of philosophy and action.Giving credit where credit is due: Heath Ledger- he lives up to the hype in my opinion. Some others think this is nothing special compared to previous demented performance like Malcolm McDowell in 'Clockwork Orange'. What they haven't considered that for someone who did schlock like '10 Things I hate about You', he transformed himself completely into a utterly psychotic killer. Ledger's Joker is not Jack Nicholson or Cesar Romero- it's his alone. Nolan's choice to make the Joker's trademark grin into a scar adds realism, even if it's untrue to the comic's storyline. Ledger even made my audience laugh uncomfortably in parts, like laughing at the crazy dude on the subway, but so crazy that no one laughs too loud for fear he'll rip your face off. Ledger made the Joker sadistic, disturbing, and one of the most memorable villains in movie history. He's not the Joker we love to hate; he's the Joker that gives you nightmares.HOWEVER, beyond that the rest was only a shade above average for an action movie. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent was good; his sincere gusto to clean up Gotham was believable, the connection he made with Bale's Batman lined up nicely even as he stole his girl- for how could Batman begrudge such a nice guy to take good care of his gal? At about 1.5 hours into this movie it seemed like all the plots were getting sewn together- Batman had foiled the Joker's attempts to kill Dent and Rachel was waiting for him back at his penthouse. Okay we're done for now right? WRONG, so the next ""ending"" to what already felt like the conclusion to the main characters' struggles was an over-wrought mess.The funny thing was that when I left the movie, I thought it was good. Perhaps if you spend $10 on admission, another $10 on popcorn, waited in line for a half-hour in the summer heat just to get a decent seat, and had waited through 20 minutes of trailers- aimed at what I assume to be teenage girls- you want to believe that THIS was SUPPOSED to be a 'GREAT MOVIE' if not 'THE' great movie of the summer.Unfortunately, I can't support that expectation. I felt that Nolan had somehow painted himself into a corner; he built up Batman's legacy in 'Begins' and now had to surpass that performance which would ultimately be a very hard act to follow.My complaints: too long, too many cheesy lines (""Bruce Wayne's penthouse is the safest place in Gotham City""), too many bit actors who could barely deliver their cheesy lines (cop- ""I didn't sign up for this""), a plot that was too convoluted and unbelievable, and weak sub-plots that tried to take on some very hefty subjects (Batman's den of cell-phone sonar spying).You can't make a movie all things to all people, but you can make a few a choice themes and laser in on it. What I assume to be Nolan's theme of chaos vs. order was sidelined by the Two-Face transformation that just seemed rushed and trite. The Joker was fabulous enough to let him chew the scenery all by himself or let him duke it out with just Batman. In fact, Batman himself doesn't have a lot of screen time and when he does Bale seems to be coasting along- even in the scene after Rachel's death.I really wanted to love this movie, but I can't get over its flaws. Maybe after a few years I can watch it again and enjoy it for what it is versus what I'd expected- much like my response to ""The Two Towers"" which departs drastically from the book. I'm not a die-hard comic fan, but if I was I think my disappointment would be greater still."
7627,True,"HERE, at long last (about 2 ½ Days) is our long awaited review of the latest Joke book to Celluloid adaptation, THE DARK KNIGHT (Legendary Pictures/Syncopy/DC Comics/Warner Brothers Pictures, 2008).IT is surely one Film, indeed a truly singular sensation of a Film, which has come out into general release so highly heralded and praised. We cannot find any Movie Critic anywhere who didn't give it the old ""Four Star-Don't Miss It-Best Picture of the Year"" treatment.THESE are areas in which we heartily concur; for we have just this very Sunday afternoon, gone to nearby suburban Hodgkins, Illinois for a viewing at the Shopping Mall Quarry 14 Cinemas; our first viewing, but surely not our last. The movie lives up to all of the hype and praise that has been heaped upon it.. Doubtle$$ thi$ will tran$late into Top $helf, Big Time, Box Office Bu$ine$$. There should also be serious consideration for THE DARK KNIGHT as Best Picture Oscar contender; as well as the late Heath Ledger's having a great shot Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.ADAPTATION from the medium of the Comic Book and its more pretentious and newly found cousin, the Graphic Novel, is what we wish to take up in our dissertation/review/diatribe(?); for you see, Schultz, it is the main area of concern and bone of contention, with this and any and all comics adaptations to film & TV.BATMAN by Bob Kane, of course, has been around ever since the feature's initial appearance in National Comics Publications' monthly publication, Detective Comics, number 27. His coming on the scene about a year after the same company's Action Comics # 1 premiered Jerry Siegel (Writer) & Joe Shuster's (Artist) SUPERMAN. These events were followed by Fawcett Publications' CAPTAIN MARVEL in the monthly Whiz Comics. Soon we had a veritable deluge of super characters from publishers such as Timely* (Sub-Mariner, Human Torch and Captain America), MLJ** (Shield, Wizard and Black Hood), Quality Comics (Plastic Man, Blackhawk and Will Eisner's The Spirit) and Fox Features (The Blue Beetle).IT was in this initial period that the character of Batman was early on established as being a dark and avenging denizen of the night. This shouldn't be rocket science, Schultz, as most all bats (except the fruit eating ones of Southeast Asia, are in fact, nocturnal in their habits. Ergo, any guy who has ""Bat"" as a descriptive part of his name or title, must be active during the nights and do his catching up on his beauty sleep while the old Sun is high in our daytime skies. This trait was most consistent during the earliest times, when ""The Batman"" was still a sort of freelancing and outlawed vigilante type. As he became an accepted, even official member of the Law Enforcement community, his appearances were as frequently set in daylight as in the late P.M. to early A.M. time periods.OUR film is set in this period and even to its conclusion, it is so; as Batman is still seen as a sort of wanted, extra-legal, independent criminal destroying privateer. If one remembers that at the conclusion of Director Tim Burton's BATMAN (Gruber Peters/Polygram/Warner Brothers, 1989) Batman was already an accepted part of the Gotham City Police Department; the beautifully crafted fade-out being a fine and memorable iconic image with the Caped Crusader's being perched on a high ledge of a great skyscraper while watching a very clearly visible Bat-Signal.AS for their treatment of the Joker, himself, we must vote this as a split decision. It was okay as far as the white faced GREEN HAIRED freak's being a sociopath of the worst ilk. In the his very first appearance in Batman Comics # 1, Spring 1940, Joker's occupation was established as a contract killer and definitely one who was indeed very happy in his work. But, from we sit, this characterization of the Joker has missed the boat in trappings; although certainly not in the personality.THEY certainly got the behavioral and anti-social attitudes of a homicidal maniac down pat; as was demonstrated most admirably right from the opening hold-up sequence. The production crew did a fine job in continuing Joker's bad reputation as a nasty, insanely ego-maniacal, cruelly motivated career criminal leader.THEY seemed to ignore totally the old Joker modus operandi of having ""theme crimes"" and giving out clues to Batman and Police Commissioner Gordon; as was a long standing practice in the comics, the Batman TV Series (1966) and the Batman Feature (1989 again). There is just no mention of any sort of these ""colorful"" crimes, whatsoever.OVERALL, this is a fine film. It meets two basic criteria to which all should be held. First, it is fine for the non-comic book crowd. Secondly, it can definitely stand on its own as an independent and self-reliant story; a definite Must See! AS for Batman and Me, we've been old friends ever since the Summer of 1957, when this 10 year old discovered 2 comics books:World's Finest Comics, No. 90, dated Sep/Oct '57 and the second comic was Batman Comics No. 110, September, 1957; which was a real watershed of comics stories and a great primer for any new Batman reader. It contained three 8 page stories. They were the cover featured ""The Phantom Batman"", in which an all too common freak accidents rendering him temporarily physically metamorphosed. The other two stories were much more interesting and informative. The middle story, ""The Secret of Batman's Butler"" gave our first in depth look at faithful Alfred. But it was the opening story which was the best. In ""The Crime of the Month Club"", we were introduced to the Joker and his Criminal Shenanigans.FROM that moment on, I knew that I wanted to be Batman.POODLE SCHNITZ!!"
7628,True,"The Dark Knight follows the themes of the division between good and evil, insanity, betrayal, hopelessness, and misunderstanding.Gotham has become flooded with terrifying events connected to the Joker , who is played by Heath Ledger. Heath's Joker has cracking white paint on his face, a swollen red smile, and hair tinged with green. He wears a suit and gloves, and moves his tongue out of his mouth when he speaks. His laughs even when he is beat up, and cackles in a manic voice. He threatens others with a knife in their mouths and a different story every time about how he got his scars on his face, implants a bomb in a man's stomach, and at times has helpers who run around in scary painted clown masks. He is frightening and the definition of villain- playing the role more psychotic and more evil than Jack Nicholson's Joker. He embodies the Joker beautifully- acting as a creature of pure malice and evil who will not stop pursuing his dream of destroying everything he can. (He of course, tells Batman that he wouldn't want to kill him because it is 'fun' having him to chase.) He says also that he doesn't have plans for anything, he just enjoys destructing this and sees what happens and what would be enjoyable to ruin next. He enjoys watching Gotham tear itself to pieces- for example in the scene where he forces boats (ones full of citizens, ones full of prisoners) to choose what boat they'd like to blow up so that the two boats will in turn blow each other up. Gotham is shown to be devoid of morality and trust, but Harvey Dent comes to be seen as the white knight in shining armor. He locks up over 50 criminals in a day, and is seen as diligent and heroic. But, after Rachel-his lover is murdered by bombs in a room full of gas tanks set up by the Joker, Harvey is heartbroken. The Joker gives the choice of Rachel or Harvey for Batman to save from the bomb. He chooses Rachel, but the Joker being insanely cruel enough to choose to murder Bruce's one love, switched the addresses for Rachel and Harvey, and Bruce ends up saving Harvey. Half of Harvey's face is burnt off by the flames from the gas, and he turns evil from his hatred for losing Rachel. He threatens to murder a person from Gordon's family to show how it feels to have a loved one murdered and live with it. Batman saves Gordon and his family, and it is thought that he murders Dent. But, he chooses to remain as the Dark Knight, the protector of Gotham and pretend that Dent died heroically as a white knight hero of Gotham.The visuals are stunning, and the movie grips you- wrenches you to the front of your seat, dares you to believe the 'impossible'- that evil will win. The actors play their roles beautifully- but of course Heath Ledger steals the show as the Joker. The movie really shows humanity as it is, and how psychotic some people in this world are- completely devoid of remorse, just looking to tear people apart for amusement. Recommend as many people as you can to see this. It is a dark masterpiece."
7629,True,"This is not an inspirational superhero film. This is a nice, gritty, dark story. Good people die unfairly, and others struggle with their losses. The intensity is well dramatized by the actors and the supporting sounds.The psychopath is scary in the worst way...in a legitimate way. Psychopaths never stop gaming, it's all they know, and it's usually about bringing their normal targets, outwardly good people, down to their lowest level. The storytellers fully recognize those facts. The intellectual twists, games and suspense remind me of the Jason Bourne films. Yeah, that good.You will sense the point when you think a normal film would have ended, but there is still more to come...another dark story to finish.You will not leave the theater feeling inspired, because there is no happy ending. But you will likely recognize and appreciate the legitimacy of this dark tale. Mr. Nolan and company will find it extremely difficult to match the quality of this story in the future.We should all relish in it while we can."
7630,True,"First of all, the joker died in the first movie. You can't bring someone back from the dead. The only reason why this movie was such a big deal is because Heath Ledger died. After watching the movie, I don't see how playing the part of the Joker would have drove him to die. Don't get me wrong. If he was the first Joker, then yea. He did a really good job. He wasn't the first and looked nothing like the first. I have nothing against the man. He was a great actor. But he had problems of his own and to say that he died because of the movie is a bunch of sh**t. Anyone could have played that part. I just feel that the media and the film makers, if they had a part in it, used the movie to cover up Heath's problems which in return made this movie out to be something so crazy when really it wasn't. I bought the movie and now I wish I wouldn't have. The true fans of the original Batman and Joker I think would have to agree that the movie was OK but that's all it was. Just OK."
7631,True,"First of all, let me start out by saying that Christopher Nolan is a director to watch out for. With each movie he is producing and directing, he is proving himself to be a man of great intellect and the craftsmanship of a virtuoso. We saw him define the most ideal Batman in the movie Batman Begins. And now we see him define the ideal Joker in the movie The Dark Knight. In comparison to all other superheroes, Batman stands out as different and unique. So, it is not easy to handle the deeper aspects of the Batman. Nolan did this with finesse and burdened himself to live up to the expectations. And boy oh boy, has he delivered.It is completely useless to have a great director with a poor cast. A few people doing good and others doing average is a disaster in the making. A great movie has always been great because it was a moment in history where all talent was combined in a perfect manner so as to produce a perfect product. The Dark Knight is one such piece of work. Everyone in the movie has done an amazing role. A great deal of credit to Nolan and his team to manage the tight rope walk of concentrating on the evolution of all characters. Heath Ledger (rip) plays the Perfect joker. He manages to convince us that he is truly the most mysterious and the most scary villain in the history of super hero stories. His ability to manipulate his voice, the body language and dialog delivery make him believable and scary. Bale does an equally amazing job as well. His struggle to understand his duty, his responsibility and his process of learning how to handle the burden of being the dark knight that Batman is, all define this movie's greatness. The IMAX experience is worth every bit of the money. Action sequences, photography and sound effects are all well done. Batman was always suppose to be a normal human being with an abnormal past and skill set. He is not the one who was gifted like other superheroes. The whole movie keeps this in mind and makes Batman a believable character. And I guess this is what is important if you want to portray Batman correctly. What is perhaps the most touching part of the movie is the ending. Batman demonstrates that the qualities of being a superhero are more mental than physical. The Batman is ready to be hated by the people of Gotham, the very people whom he has done a favor by cleaning their streets of all the criminals who were hell bent on making their lives miserable. The ending dialog between Gordon and Batman is a highlight of the movie and not only justifies the the title of the movie but also defines the true meaning of being a superhero. All in all, The Dark Knight is the ideal sequel to Batman Begins and is an extremely well done movie. Thumbs up! Great direction, an incredible story, a solid cast, great music and overall a great package."
7632,True,this batman movie has got to be the most dark and violent batman movie ever made.........it is the movie of 2008when i first saw batman begins it totally disappoint me so when the dark knight came out i didn't know if i wanted to see it but luckily i did...........this movie was simply fantasticit is hard to find a movie thats 2 and something hours long nowadays and enjoyed every scene in it plus the acting was superb.......Heath ledgers portrayal of joker was the best joker i ever seen.......this joker was sadistic.......psychologically disturb........he was down right crazy and scary..........he still had the clown face makeup on but it was all spattered on his face giving him a crazed villain look.........and his voice it was whiny and mocking.......Heath Ledgers portrayal of joker sent chills up my spine....Christian Bale as Batman........his acting was great but Heath Legder clearly outshine any of the characters in the movie
7633,True,"To simplify things, I'll list things I like and didn't like from the movie.DIDN'T LIKE: -Joker didn't feel like the best joker there could be,(which is the one from TAS), yet Ledger delivers solid performance to a different or new joker, who ends up being quite satisfying.-There were like 4 villains in one movie and all of them got arrested. It felt as though villains were being pushed into the storyline. Even though it ended up somewhat OK, it's still not right. The plots of some villains weren't developed at all. They put an end to MANY, too many characters in so little time. Leave Scarecrow out of this movie and elaborate more on two-face, he lasted one whole movie a few Batman movies ago.It feels like they put to life many villains and then decided to kill them all really fast, except for the joker.-The movie should have be more concentrated on Dent and Joker. SO many unfinished issues, or issues have have been prematurely ended.LIKED:-Nice graphics, sound, script ( not cheesy like superman ) -Very interesting plot, many things happening, sometimes too much, but it's OK... more action -Jokers' schemes were quite amusing-Not saying a lot here because it's only a few things which I elaborate don a lot that made the movie sub-fullpotential.All in all 8-9 / 10 PS: Big TAS fan right here. The Joker from TAS is immortal."
7634,True,"This might be a useful review for other folks like me who saw the movie, but are not typical action/comic book movie fans. I went in not expecting this to be my kind of film; for fans of this genre, it will admittedly rate higher.Firstly, Chicago looked great in this film. Gotham, and its look and feel, is as important as any character in the film. Chicago's architecture was wonderfully suited to this film.Heath Ledger was brilliant. The rotting stench of human decay poured over his putrid yellow teeth and through the screen right into my seat. He brought an energy and interest to every scene he was in, and the other characters were made more interesting wherever they interacted with him. Watching his performance, I felt the tragedy of Heath's death all over again.The movie is too long - I found that its extraordinary length ultimately diluted the impact of the story. And I was frustrated that with such a long movie, there wasn't more good storytelling, so much as there was a lot of complicated and over-wrought action scenes. The fight between good and evil is the oldest story, and I needed more to make it one I could really care about.Here are my thoughts: 1. Heath Ledger's Joker was brilliant. The character, the costume, the atmosphere he created - he was completely engaging and completely repulsive at the same time. But who was he really? There is no back story, other than the Joker's various versions of his past. Did he truly spring into Gotham having never before made an appearance? I wanted to understand him as more than a plot device to forward the Batman story.2. Christian Bale's Batman/Bruce Wayne feels wooden and heavy. We 'know' how he feels, but don't actually feel any of it. He seems overwhelmed with the burden of being the last defense against evil, and his character and the story are both suffused with this heaviness. I wanted to see more of his own spirit and conviction at work, instead of his inevitable resignation at being 'the Batman.' 3. So many philosophical/moral/spiritual issues were raised. Can you overcome evil without becoming evil? Can ordinary human goodness be heroic enough to combat evil? Is the ordinariness of people evil in its ordinariness? What is the impact of one agent of chaos on organized society? What do you lose by not destroying evil for the sake of goodness? Can society survive when the scales between good and evil are tipped in favor of evil? Lots of good questions, but questions that were overwhelmed with too many plot tricks and complications.4. I was frustrated that the ""truth teller"" in the movie was so completely evil. The Joker speaks a wise and unfiltered truth without fear and is willing to lose everything (much like Hannibal Lechter in Silence of the Lambs). While Alred the butler, and Morgan Freemen are clearly the conscience of Batman, they speak openly only to him, and then they say very little. The Joker is the only character of complete originality and creativity, crafting a world of his own design. I wanted Batman to offer us the same depth and insight. I wanted him to be energized and excited by the fight for good, just as the Joker is by chaos. 5. Aaron Eckhardt/Harvey Dent was initially a warm and three-dimensional character, ready to take the helm from Batman, so his decent into evil felt contrived, too quick and too predictable. Clearly he was broken hearted at Rachel's death, but it's not clear why his integrity, which stood strong against every other opposition, suddenly collapsed. I wanted to see his struggle, not just the evil that followed. 6. The acting by all was generally solid, but mostly uninteresting. I wasn't really pulled into the story and the only character that felt 'real' was the Joker. 7. The directing was generally solid, but action sequences and story line got muddled and overdone. I got lost again and again in over-long action sequences and in the incredible plot twists...suddenly the police commissioner has come back from the dead! But how? No explanation of this miraculous occurrence, and so I just felt shut-out of the story development.The Matrix proves you can mix action and philosophy, stories and special effects. I wanted to see a closer marriage of that here, but never felt the divergent elements of the film working together to truly support the underlying message."
7635,True,"Really this movie is wrong in every way it is an example of how not to tell a superhero movie placing it in reality is OK but then you are bound to the rules of reality and this movies applies superhero rules in reality(jumping on a car in the car park without breaking legs ??) And it also defies logic(henchmen who keep getting killed and still there is an ample supply of to fill the ranks,these guys must be dumb.) A villain who act contrary to what he proclaims he isn't funny(he is not chaos he acts to much like like an Einstein for that). needless sidetracks that lead to nothing(the whole bullet set-up). The philosophy 101 scenes that interrupt the flow of the movie just to make a point is so lame. The totally wooden acting from everyone except Ledger and Oldman(as if they edited all the worst takes of the other actors to give Ledger's performance some shine??) Setting is not Gothic it is dark techno-punk or tech-noir the city doesn't look like the city in Batman Begins(which was a great film). This part is not needed if you look at the three movies because it has nothing to do with the story-line of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight Rises (Dent was not in BB and TDKR and Two-Face was killed in this movie and Rachel whose part had a different actress than BB is killed of and for the plot of TDKR Rachel is only needed to be reminded that she is dead ,and would not have waited for Bruce.) Even the Joker's performance isn't that great either but it stands out because all the other acting is wooden. I can continue about more things that annoy me about The Dark Knight but then I can write a page full of things.What surprised me what rating this got and that is too much for such a bad movies that tries to be two movies at once but fails at both of them. (and the raspy voice and way to prominent soundtrack)"
7636,True,"The dark night was said to be a great film and much better than any other batman movie sadly this movie wrecked the way people look at the batman title now the thing that wrecked it for me was the joker he is not the best joker ever yes it was good acting and yes I think heath Leger was great for the part but that was not the joker you saw the real joker dose not going round holing a knife in his pocket did not have face paint did not have look hair and his smile was not done on by his dad the hole reason he what to kill batman is not that he is hired by the gangland war big bosses but because batman was the one who left him scared after he dropped him into acid what was the director thinking to muck up one of the greatest characters ever made look at mark Hamal or jack Nicholson the best two jokers ever why did they change him to a man that was more like victor Zsasz but apart from this big let down the rest of the movie was grate two face, fox ,Alfred and Gordon where the characters that made the move shine and make me get over the shame on the joker because that was a joke"
7637,True,"The Dark Knight is the second part of Christopher Nolan's gritty re-imagination of the Batman saga. The cast of Batman begins stays with the exception of Katie Holmes being replaced by Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes. Morgan Freeman's Lucius still supplies Batman with his cool cars and gadgets and Michael Caine still plays Batman's servant Alfred. New to the trilogy is Heath Ledger's psychopathic Joker and Aaron Eckhart's White Knight/Two-Face Harvey Dent.If there's one thing to criticize about The Dark Knight it's something that seems to be an issue in many Christopher Nolan films: The explanatory dialogue. Nolan doesn't always follow the rule ""Show, don't tell"" and has his character be stand-ins for the audience, explaining what could be communicated visually. It's a minor flaw though and the only thing taking the viewer out of this otherwise ridiculously great film.Accompanied by Hans Zimmer's score the film moves forward at a steady pace, allowing the story to happen and the characters to develop simultaneously through their actions. The cinematography has epic proportions and the use of action is never unnecessary filler material but a device to move the plot forward, always full of gravitas and feeling like it has actual consequences. Other superhero films need music montages to make the hero look cool. Batman in The Dark Knight is always cool, without the need for artificial coolness, as it should be.The Dark Knight turns the conception of ""The superhero is purely good and fights against the purely evil villain"" around. There are always casualties. There's no such thing as a perfect choice that makes the good people happy and the bad people pay for their crimes. The world is unfair and for Harvey Dent's character that's unbearable. Because evil and corruption have taken what he loved most away from him he decided to bring justice to Gotham by making everything happen unbiased, by chance.The Joker brings chaos into the world of the superhero where there should be the good guys and the bad guys. He makes people question their moral and tries to make them believe that they all are like him, maniacs only being held back by society's laws and rules. The courts of Gotham itself is corrupted by the mob so even the place where justice should be isn't safe of bad people and moral injustice. Heath Ledger personifies that idea of anarchy so well and every bit of praise he's gotten is well deserved.In the end Batman cruises through the night, having done his deed, knowing that there is no final justice but that everything he's done has improved morality and justice on the whole. He lets someone else take the fame and goes back into the dark streets of Gotham, waiting for the next maniac to come along, upping his defense and making us want to see if he manages to expel evil in the last part of the trilogy."
7638,True,"This is a great movie. Christopher Nolan is putting together a very impressive resume, and it appears he's the next great filmmaker. The Dark Knight moves along at a rapid pace and it completely works. You get just enough out of the scenes, then it keeps jumping forward. The writing is excellent. This is the Hollywood blockbuster we deserve. A smart, action-filled, visually stunning, truly awesome flick. I think it's safe to say Heath Ledger owns this movie. Nearly all the best moments come from the Joker. I really think Ledger delivered one of the best performances seen on film. Nolan's Joker was great to begin with, and Ledger made it his own. The character is simply brilliant. And you know who else's character was really smart, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent. Dent was great, and he should make Batman 3 every bit as good. Eckhart gave a very strong performance, as did Oldman, Gyllenhaal, Caine, Freeman, and even Bale. The cast is so grade-A. Smart, smart movie making. Thank you, Chris Nolan, for saving the Batman franchise, even more than that, making it greater than ever before. I rate this movie a 9.5 outta 10, one of the best action-adventures ever!"
7639,True,"It seems that movie makers have lost the art of creating a good, scary batman flick. The last such film to grace the screen was probably batman, and that was a decade ago. Since then, the ""sensitive"" batman has come into vogue -- a creature tortured by its own inhumanity and appetites. While these existential night stalkers have an appeal as character studies, they aren't all that frightening. True evil, of the absolute, soulless kind, is what makes for a terrifying bloodsucker. Unfortunately, that's not exactly what The Dark Knight offers.To be fair, Christian Bale does a better-than-average job as Bruce Wayne, the last Batman on Earth. There are moments when Bale is positively chilling, and he doesn't ham it up too much. Comedy is mixed in effectively, but it's what the humor is mingled with that doesn't work. As a horror film, The Dark knight is a failure. MY COMMENT: THis is true, but its more comedic than horror. Bale can not be taken seriously given his previous roles so why would you review a movie expecting it to be a horror??? END COMMENT Aside from Bale's creature, there's nothing compelling in this picture. The script is dull, the characters are flat, and the direction is rather ordinary. (This is especially surprising considering that horror master Chris Nolan, who did the first and last Nightmare on Elm Streets, is at the helm.) Bruce Wayne makes his entrance to Gotham by crashing a ship into the docks. On board are numerous corpses, all drained of blood. A huge wolf is seen disembarking, but no one believes the eyewitness. Next thing, there's a Batman roaming the streets, feeding on gangsters and recruiting a young thief/con man (Morgan Freeman) as his ghoulish servant. But Bruce is in New York for a reason -- he's on the trail of the only other member of his kind, the offspring of a Batman/human mating, a woman whose ""other half still sleepwalks in humanity."" He intends to bring out her true nature and introduce her to immortality. The person in question happens to be Rita Veder (Maggie Gyllenhal), a police officer assigned to investigate the murders on the ship that brought Bruce to the United States. And the batman isn't the only one interested in her. Her partner, Justice (Aaron Ekhart), is equally smitten.The hero is supposed to be Justice, but Aaron Ekhart's portrayal lacks energy. The result is a bland and unsympathetic character. Why should we care about this guy? Instead, our attention gravitates to Bale, the only performer attacking his role with relish. Thus, as in all recent batman movies, it's the villain, not the good guy, who keeps us interested. And Bruce isn't really such a bad seed -- he's just lonely and misunderstood. The centuries can turn tedious without a mate to share them with. There's some chemistry between Bale and Gyllenhal, but absolutely none in the Gyllenhal/Ekhart pairing. Yet both relationships get equal screen time.There are a few comic highlights. One occurs when Bruce shape-shifts into an Al Sharpton-type preacher who gives a sermon on how ""evil is good."" Here, as the script ventures into pure satire, it acquires an edge that is absent most of the rest of the time. Also, some of the interplay between the Joker (Heath Ledger) and his older buddy Silas (also, Heath Ledger) is witty, and worthy of a few laughs. This pair does a great ""Two Stooges"" act.Overall, however, The Dark Knight doesn't live up to its promise or premise. The humor is hit-and-miss and the horror just isn't all that frightening. Christian Bale proves that he still has screen presence, but he needs a better showcase. The problem here isn't as much the talent in front of the camera as it is the weak and hackneyed script. The Dark Knight is in need of an infusion (or should that be transfusion?) of originality and creativity -- two qualities that are blatantly absent."
7640,True,"Directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, The Prestige) and penned in conjunction with his brother Jonathan Nolan, this powerhouse collaborative team brings us The Dark Knight, the highly anticipated sequel to Batman Begins. While the 2005 reboot of the Batman franchise dealt primarily with his origins, The Dark Knight sees Batman (Christian Bale) and Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) join forces with Gotham's new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), to take on a deranged bank robber known only as The Joker (Heath Ledger). Of course it's never quite as simple as battling just the one villain, after some shady underworld business dealings go wrong, just about every criminal scumbag in Gotham is now gunning for both Batman and The Joker.From the opening scene through to the inevitable conclusion, Nolan grabs you firmly by the shirt collar, like Batman dangling a Gotham hoodlum from a rooftop. You expect him to grow tired, to falter and let you splat on to the vicious street below. But he never does. If you thought that Batman Begins was dark, gritty and action-packed, think again - The Dark Knight turns the intensity up to eleven, and once it has you in its grip, it never lets go. The fights. The car chases. The vicious cat-and-mouse game between Batman and The Joker. The twists and turns.For me, watching The Dark Knight was akin to running an emotional marathon. It had nothing to do with the films length - I'm toilet trained and older than five years old, so I've got no issue with longish films - it was the fact that after all was said and done, I came out the other side with a feeling of being completely wrecked. Maybe that's the sign of a good film? Maybe that's the sign of a film that tried to cram too much into it? I suspect it's a little from column A, and a little from column B. Like just about every comic book film floating around on the screen of late, there's always the propensity to try and give the audience ultimate bang-for-their-buck - too much exposition and intricacy in the story. Sure, the WTF-quotient wasn't exactly registering anywhere near David Lynch levels, but at times it felt like there were so many twists and deviations that the story became a little difficult to follow. Maybe it's my old age, or the fact that I chose the wrong day to stop sniffing glue, but it took me a while to figure out the point of Bruce Wayne's ludicrous CSI: Gotham attempt to pull a fingerprint from a shattered bullet.Oh, and why is it that one villain is never enough for modern audiences? Apparently we need at least two. Christ, sometimes even three. I can certainly see how the two villain setup is useful for moving the story along, but generally more villains equals more backstories, more subplots and ultimately at least one or two villains that are never truly developed to their full potential. Well, that's assuming you don't want to push the running time past the two and a half hour mark. Frankly I found the second villain, Two Face, to be utterly pointless - if you are going to completely underuse a villain, then you should have made The Dark Knight solely about The Joker. I'm pretty certain Ledger's character could have easily carried the entire film.If you sat through the entirety of Spiderman 3 without killing yourself, then you will know exactly what I mean about multiple villains. Fortunately The Dark Knight shits all over Spiderman 3 - I only watched it for the customary Bruce Campbell cameo. Honest.What about the performances? Christian Bale as Batman  I love The Bale, and while he does a good job as the Caped Crusader, I had a couple of issues with his performance. The first was the voice. Christ, I couldn't stop pissing myself laughing every time Batman opened his mouth: it was almost as if the Dark Knight not only had severe laryngitis, but throat cancer and a penchant for chain-smoking twenty packets of Winnie Blues a day. It was annoying to the point of distraction. Don't get me wrong, I understand why he does it, and I'm sure he did much the same thing in Batman Begins, but come on, like you can't tell it's just Bruce Wayne putting on a dodgy voice.Then there's Heath Ledger. Wow. I didn't want to buy into all of this hype, but after seeing Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight, I've got to admit that much of that hype was deserved. He absolutely blew the rest of the cast out of the water. Come to think of it, he completely blew Jack Nicholson's Joker out of the water as well. The mannerisms. The subtle nuances. The on screen presence. I've never really been a big fan of Ledger, but I was completely and utterly captivated by Ledger's performance as this psychotic agent of chaos. I was hypnotized every second he was on the screen.Overall, The Dark Knight matches, if not surpasses Batman Begins on just about every level. It's a dark, non-stop thrill ride, and while the story felt a little convoluted at times, it is worth the price of admission for Heath Ledger alone. The Nolan brothers have certainly made a name for themselves in a short space of time: Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, The Prestige. Not a bad way to start a career by any standard. With Christopher's skill behind the camera, and Jonathan's ability to craft story, the future of Hollywood looks bright. If they can build on the momentum of The Dark Knight, I can't wait to see where the go with the third, and possibly final Batman film with the Nolan brothers at the helm.Edited excerpt from: www.youseenthat.com"
7641,True,"Oh look, here comes another remake/sequel to waste hard earned money on this summer. With endless sequels and remakes bombarding you, how can you know which movies to take seriously? Just know Batman: The Dark Knight is everything you want and need from a cinematic portrayal of a great comic book epic. The movie preceding this was Batman Begins and that blew me out of the water as well and I thought it would be impossible for lightning to strike twice, I was pleasantly surprised. The movie delivered every aspect of Batman one could ever wish for. Christian Bale gives the audience a Batman that has been forever seen in comic books but never displayed on screen, one that can die. A masked hero doing what is right no matter the circumstance, even if that means sacrificing himself for the greater good of the city. A darker view of Gotham City is used to submerge the audience into the horror of reality. The director, Christopher Nolan, Presented Gotham City in a new light opposed to batman movies of the past. To be frank, it's frighteningly realistic. The days seem like any other day in a big city but when the sun goes down the cloak of night brings out the crime and malice which is plaguing the city. The late Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker makes the movie a thrill ride from start to finish. This Joker is not like the other renditions, aka-Jack Nicholson; he is the best at being downright evil, corrupt, insane, psychotic, terrifying. More scary than funny, he shows audiences the Joker is undoubtedly Batman's biggest threat to Gotham City, challenging him all the way, a mass-murdering psychopath with a lust for anarchy. The Joker terrorizes the city of Gotham into submission and uses their fear to destroy the Batman. Batman faces a moral dilemma throughout the movie and the Joker taunts him the whole way to make that controversial decision. The Dark Knight is indeed a great blockbuster flick that will have you forgetting that there's popcorn and soda by your side. From the dazzling performance of the late Heath Ledger to the carefully-constructed action sequences performed by Christian Bale which keep the pace flowing and you on the edge of your seat, there is plenty good about this movie. This movie is a must for any self respecting comic book fan and a great film for the whole family."
7642,True,In the darkness of Gotham City crime lurks around every corner and a mysterious Joker comes out of the dark only to expose Batman. Heath Ledger gives the acting performance of his life. I have never seen such sinister acting on stage. Ever. Something about that performance brings a chill to my spine as I know that it's one of the last movies that Heath Ledger ever did. The role of the Joker makes the movie. It makes the performance of Jack Nicholson seem tame. There were also excellent performances by Christian Bale as Batman and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent. I don't know how there could be another Batman movie that compares to this. The movie is filled with pain and revenge and yet it's heart stopping and breathtaking at the same time. It's one the greatest movies that I have seen lately.
7643,True,"Through two and a half hours of plot twists, intense action and stunningly creepy acting, watching Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight proves to be an intriguing, but almost demanding experience. Much like the story-line to the previous film in Warner Brother's new incarnation of the Batman franchise - Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne and the audience are pulled through an intense series of turns and twists as Batman struggles with both his desire for justice in Gotham City and to be with those he loves. The Dark Knight, however, goes far beyond Wayne's internal conflict and explores richer themes such as the question of whether people are basically good or evil, or the personification of anarchy in the character of the Joker. Amid the hype and buzz surrounding this summer blockbuster, the careful viewer will find excellent writing coming through precise performances by the cast. The careful viewer will also find that however carefully they watched it, one viewing will not be enough. Regardless of what the film credits state, the obvious star of The Dark Knight is Heath Ledger as the Joker. Complete with incessant lip-smacking, slight twitches and a piercing glare, the Joker scares you far beyond what any make-up or CGI can do. Through this powerful character, Ledger portrays an evil nature that seems to have no real motivation except only to be an 'agent of chaos'. In this sense the Joker becomes so much more than any other villain encountered by Batman. Unlike previous representations of Batman's arch-nemesis, Nolan chooses to provide no firm back-story to the Joker's origins. The only taste to background the audience receives are two (almost three) conflicting stories the Joker gives explaining the scars that place his face in a permanent ghoulish smile. Such ambiguity only seems to lend even more to Joker embodying evil rather than just representing it. This new breed of villain elevates the game Batman is now forced to play and also raises the stakes of what he must sacrifice for the greater good. Beyond the Joker's personification of anarchy, The Dark Knight also explores the question of the innate goodness of the human spirit. As the Gotham Police Force and Batman are riddled with betrayal from within their cause, the outlook looks dismal for the human soul. This is typified by the transformation of Harvey Dent into Two-Face; the Joker is out to prove that the best of the best can go sour if pushed in the right way. Fortunately, the Joker's social experiment does fail on the larger scale and ironically because of the decisions of former criminals.Many in the film industry pronounced the recent wave of comic book films as simply fad; a trend that would fade as viewers caught on to the cliché. Unlike the Marvel franchise, which has started to roll out relatively mediocre hero-based flicks every 6 months or so, DC Comics has discretely decided against this. By equipping this film project with a budget comparable to the other 'epic' movie efforts of our time and the extremely qualified writer/director Chris Nolan the result are completely apparent. The Dark Knight stands as evidence that superhero movies are not just a generational fad and maybe even can be considered high art, or, at least, higher art."
7644,True,"I'll be honest with everyone - I've never seen Batman Begins. Truth be told, I was not interested in it when it came out, because I thought it looked corny and there had already been too many Batman movies. But when 2008 rolled around and I saw the trailer for The Dark Knight before Get Smart, I was pumped. It looked like a total headrush, a dark and violent Batman that had never been before. It mimicked the original paths of the comics, and Heath Ledger looked like a man who would burn in Hell as the Joker. So I knew I had to see this movie, preferably on the big screen.Director Christopher Nolan really knows how to shake a viewer around. His quick cuts during scenes leave the viewer barely hanging on from one shot to the next. This is a good thing, because none of what we see gets so boring or tedious that we zone out for a while. It's also a good way to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat, because the way that we zoom around from one action sequence involving Batman to a sequence that occurs the next day leaves the audience wondering what happened that we didn't see. It doesn't allow us to really contemplate what comes next, because we're so absorbed in the current predicament that we're not thinking about the next scene. The quick cuts allow twists and turns to be packed into the 2 and a half hour runtime, keeping The Dark Knight from becoming clichéd.Christian Bale, I feel, plays Bruce Wayne better than he does Batman. Batman's growl, while needed to disguise his voice, feels too exaggerated. With the gadgets that Lucius (Morgan Freeman) comes up with, Batman should be able to have a better guise than Bale's polar bear growl. Yet Bale's emotions come through, especially when Rachel is the subject at hand. But even though Batman is the main protagonist, the film doesn't feel like it's actually about Batman.The Joker seems to be more the main subject, even from the very beginning where the camera seems to be following Ledger as one of his minions. We, as the camera, seem to be silent observers in the Joker's carnage, even focusing on him as he blows up a hospital. The Batman seems second to the Joker, as if The Dark Knight is a clinical observation of the Joker's personality and mental disorders.Ledger's portrayal is absolutely deserving of the early cries of Oscar nominations at the time of his death. I was afraid that his death would generate too much emotional love for him instead of actually focusing on his acting ability displayed in Knight, but after seeing his work with an attempt at an unbiased reaction, I can safely say that these commendations are correct. Ledger's role is visceral, emotional, disturbing, and even comedic. Ledger brought a gamut of adjectives to the Joker's character, most of which can be lumped into one category - devilish. Ledger's laugh and his unnerving calm even during some of the Joker's darkest scenes add to how depressing and black the atmospher of The Dark Knight really is.The Dark Knight hits on so many themes of violence and paranoia, desperation and love, that it's hard to discuss in one review. However, The Dark Knight really pours on the darkness towards mankind. The violence the Joker creates with his hands, his misanthropic worldview, and his uncaring attitude towards anything besides committing arson on the whole world are chilling, and the script has many spine-tingling lines which go right to the core of the human soul. One of my favorite motifs that Knight touches on is the dilemma - the meaning - of what being a hero is. Everyone wants to be the hero - everything needs a hero, and what if there isn't one? What if Batman is just a do-good criminal? What does that do to society? Does it tear it down, or build a new hero? Can there be an innocent hero, or is that just naiveté? Also, much of what many people want to know is about the action. The Dark Knight is not full of fist- and gunfights, but when they happen, it's really hard to miss. Some are over-the-top, like a chase sequence in which Batman motors his Batmobile in front of an oncoming bazooka shot, or an exploding hospital that, from sky-level, looks like a gas station went up in one of your Hot Wheels toy models.Others are pretty impressive, especially when Batman wrangles in Rachel while falling from a building. But all in all, The Dark Knight left me feeling like jumping down the escalator and beating up a masked guy stealing an old lady's purse, then jumping down the elevator shaft, rolling over my car, and then stopping to get coffee while battling armed robbers at the local Starbucks. That's pretty damn impressive.If you're looking for a nice superhero movie to take the kids to, you might want to settle for the flop that is Spiderman 3. If you want a really dark, daring, fast-moving action-packed ride, with lots of thought involved, The Dark Knight is for you. It's Heath Ledger's final complete movie, and one of his best. This film's Joker may go down as the best in history - and you want to skip it to go see Mamma Mia!? Put this on your list of movies to see - Alfred and Bruce Wayne will be waiting to put you in your place if you don't. And Batman ain't too happy anymore."
7645,True,"This simply is the best action film of this year.There was never a dull moment in the movie, never a lull in the action, even when the characters were engaging in small talk.'Batman Begins' was simply an action movie, whereas 'The Dark Knight' was an absolute and engaging detective story, with all the makings of Oscar potential.The only qualm I have with anything, is the cowl. It still looks like the children's toy, bulky and over-sized for the head. I know the writers were pursuing a more realistic approach, but you can fabricate some misstruths that would allow all that gadgetry to be more streamline inside the cowl.Besides that everything about this film is masterful.The Joker is everything himself says he is, a new kind of criminal. And the best kind, is the kind that you want to copy, want to talk like, wan to act like, want to feel like. A likable character, something which the magnificent Ledger must have understood, and employed.If you haven't walked out of this movie thinking, speaking or even walking differently, then I suggest you buy another ticket."
7646,True,"It's a shame that even before this films release it was subject to such a huge amount of hype due to the tragic death of heath ledger. I have been a huge fan of the batman franchise and have been looking forward to the idea of this film even at the hint of it at the end of Batman Begins. I am more than happy to say that this film goes far beyond what the majority of people have expected from it. With the amount of press coverage this film was receiving already, even before its release it was going to be hard for it to actually perform, but as soon as it begins from the intelligent bank robbery and eventual joker introduction the film never fails to deliver. It is everything a comic book adaption should be, truly living up to the comics themselves. The entire cast play excellent parts, some new to the team but still are up to the challenge and really add to the films atmosphere, But I again hate to agree with the hype but Heath Ledgers performance was outstanding, the way he took on such a complex character and made it his own really made the Dark Knight what it was, with a perfect balance of humour and grimness this really was the perfect villain. His performance was not the only one that made the film what it was, Aaron Eckhart's performance as Harvey Dent and Two Face was astonishing. It really showed the dark part of the film showing the downfall of the 'good guy' turning to crime to get what he wanted. I hate to follow this crowd but this time it has to be said the crowd was 100% correct, this has raised the bar and set the standard for all comic book adaptions to come in the future. I can't agree that it's the best film ever made but as far as comic book adaptions go it's pretty much spot on."
7647,True,"OK without a doubt Heath Ledger was fantastic in this, his performance I loved but surely a little back story on why he was such a psycho is needed. That's why I think I prefer the Keaton/Nicholson story line, nothing beats ""You created me"" ""No, you created me"" that is good story. This is what this lacks, a decent narrative, it's action all the way. And every time Caine opens his mouth it's like he is some Ancient Sage. The 30 minutes in the middle as every one is rushing around to save different people I loved, really nail-biting tension, that I will give you, but the rest of the film to me, was like a classic graphic novel character gets the ""Die Hard"" make over.""In Bruges"" is a better film than this."
7648,True,"When I saw the trailers for ""The Dark Knight"", I knew it was going to be a hit. And I wasn't disappointed. I highly enjoyed watching The Dark Knight. It's got the makings of a great film; An A-List cast, great cinematography, great story, and a large fan-base.The first thing that really struck me was the cinematography. The camera-work, coloring, everything is excellent. The dark nature of the story is represented perfectly in this film, and truly represents the story. Even during the fund-raiser hosted by Wayne, there is a tinge of darkness to the way it is filmed, and it really boosts the feeling of the story.The next element that really amazed me was the acting. Everyone's performance is top-notch. Bale makes the best Batman yet, and is perfect for the role. Ledger. What more needs to be said of his performance that hasn't yet been? Absolutely phenomenal. Eckhart especially impressed me with his solid run as Harvey Dent. He made a great new light to Gotham, but also maintained his performance as the crushed Two-Face. Oldman as Gordan was also great, as he is one of my favorite actors, and really brought all that the Batman's side of the law should bring.The story is just brilliant. Period.I do have a few, sort of complaints. The movie is abit overlong, it does drag in some places. I wasn't disappointed with the film, but I wasn't overly impressed. I expected it to be amazing, and it was. It was exactly what I thought it would be. A lot of my friends are saying it is the best movie ever, or similar thoughts. I loved it, but it's far from the best movie ever. It's a great movie, but I was actually more impressed with Begins simply because it was such a drastic change in vision. This seems like an extreme refinement of that vision. I do think the film is abit over-hyped, but I'd see again in a heartbeat.Everything was on-point, and it did not lack in any area. I was not disappointed, but I was not overly-impressed, and I think people are way-overrating it. It was a great film, but by no means revolutionary, more the perfect refinement of Nolan's vision.I cannot even fathom what amazing things we will see in the next installment. I believe the next film will absolutely break boundaries."
7649,True,"I know this is going to start some trouble,but i gotta write it.There is a tactic used in movies that does get on my nerves,but i don't get bent over it because i know that's how society can be.(Not how it always is.)What movie makers do in order to keep the audience with the story and not become upset with the death of a character,is make said character a black person.The fact of the matter is that most of the viewing public is white,and nothing is more upsetting than a white person biting it.This is not always the case,many,many movies off plenty of white people,i know.Most of the time it is within the context of the story-horror,serial killer,etc.-but during some movies it is used,and it does work.Before you fly off the handle and post some juvenile hate-filled rant my way,do some research for yourself.That being said,i loved this movie-see it in Imax please-but i was disappointed to see this tactic used so often in it.The joker killed about four black people,which didn't bother me too much,but i don't see why they couldn't have mixed it up a little."
7650,True,"The Dark Knight is the second instalment of Christopher Nolan's series of Batman films, with the first being Batman Begins. This story is based around The Joker, (Heath Ledger) a psychopathic maniac, who causes mayhem in Gotham City and Batman (Christian Bale) trying to stop him. It questions whether Batman is the true hero of Gotham City or if the public believe in someone else. The opening scene is just spectacular; it takes place in bank and shows an extremely exciting robbery in which each robber gets killed by another until finally The Joker is left with all the money. The scene really gets the audience immediately hooked on the film, unable to take their eyes off the screen. About five minutes later, it begins another action packed scene that includes Batman stopping The Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy), a gang of mobsters and a bunch of Batman copy-cats. Throughout the film there are many scenes that are action packed and gripping. In one scene it shows two boats, one full of citizens and one full of criminals. They are told by The Joker to blow up the other boat in order to survive, but if they don't both boats will be blown up. They argue and take votes on what decision to make and it makes the audience themselves think, what would I do in that situation? The acting is marvellous by most of the actors in the film. Gary Oldman, who plays Lt. James Gordon, was spectacular and you could really see the frustration his character was going through when he was unable to stop the Joker from killing his friends, colleagues and the citizens of Gotham City. When his character is forced to choose between his family members, you can really feel the heartache and pain of what he is going through. It is another outstanding performance by Gary Oldman. Aaron Eckhart's character, Harvey Dent, is honestly a pretty boring character and the only emotion he really has is his love for Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal). However, the minute he turns into Two Face, his acting abilities shine through, which is probably helped with the shocking special effects that are used on half of his face. Heath Ledger, who unfortunately passed away recently, plays The Joker and is the highlight of the film. He makes his character absolutely terrifying, but completely hilarious at the same time. The Joker has no rules and causes complete chaos just to watch people's reactions. This is Heath's last complete film role and it is such an amazing performance that he should win the Oscar that many people are speculating about.I, personally, am not a huge Batman fan, but I have seen one or two of the previous movies, not including Batman Begins. The Dark Knight does not feel like a comic book movie, even if it is Batman. It is serious and dark, unlike Batman and Robin which is comical, camp and crap. If you are not a Batman fan, you will still enjoy the movie. You don't need to have seen Batman Begins to understand what is going on. The only thing I questioned was whether Rachel knew the true identity of Batman, Bruce Wayne, but within about twenty seconds, I realised that in fact she did. During the film, I noticed the reactions of the other audience members; some were hiding behind their coats, whilst others at the same time had a constant grin on their face. The film excellently combines thrill and humour to give it that something special.The disappointing things about The Dark Knight were that it is over two and a half hours long and it does seem as if it drags on a bit. Also, I was extremely disappointed in Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance as Rachel Dawes. I found her acting bland and unemotional. She didn't seem bothered when The Joker was threatening her or when she thrown off the building, which resulted in the most pathetic scream I have ever heard. I really didn't care if she was the one who ended up getting blown up at the end. Another thing that just really annoyed me was Batman's voice, yes he has to disguise it so people don't recognise his real voice, but I just found it was annoying, weird and comical.Overall, the film is spectacular, Heath Ledger's Joker was bloody amazing and it is a must see. It has got to be the best summer movie of 2008 or generally, one of the best movies of 2008."
7651,True,"I can comment on the fact that I think that C. Bale is one of the most talented and determined actors of my generation and greatly surpasses all the hyped up actors of the 90s. This is an actor, period.I could also comment on the fact that H. Ledger ( r.i.p. ) has also portrayed 'the Joker' as one of the 1st and few ever really good 'villians'( yes I use quotation marks because.. me .. myself.. I would be a Joker follower, probably.. because these are strange days we live in and only a man with the vision and ability to sacrifice (others) to the cause in opening our eyes to these times deserves a vote ) but I don't have to as I am sure this is impossible to overlook.Another thing I could comment on would be the fact that I see so many people now casting a shadow over 'Batman Begins' in comparison, I personally think that 'the Dark Knight' would not be as good without it and they both just utterly complement each other so well. I suggest people to go watch them in a reverse order to really appreciate 'Batman Begins' more deeply.Well those are a few things I could comment about but I will not.. Just go watch the movie and make up your own mind.Have a .. strange day ..J."
7652,True,"before i saw the dark knight, i prepared myself for just another hyped-up superhero sequel. and me, hating action movies, found it the best superhero movie i have ever seen! it was thoroughly entertaining in every way and definitely delivered. starting with the acting- it had great actors in it. Christian bale played a beautiful balance of Bruce Wayne and batman, or the ""dark knight."" heath ledger, wow.. he played an amazing part and i wouldn't doubt he wins an Oscar. it was not what i expected, but way better. i love how there's kind of a moral, how not everyone can be trusted.. and not to rely on just one person to be the ""hero,"" as said by the joker. the storyline was not exactly ""classic batman."" especially when it came to the joker. he was twisted and crazy, but portrayed perfectly and he was made very believable. not as family-oriented as you would expect your regular superhero movie to be, but definitely a great movie. after seeing it, i definitely recommend it and was not surprised with how much it has grossed so far.10 out of 10 (:"
7653,True,"Back in 2005, I saw ""Batman Begins"" and fell in love with it: finally, a Batman that got the character and the world he lives in right, not a flawed live action cartoon. I thought things couldn't get any better.""The Dark Knight"" has proved me wrong. And I'm glad of it.For starters, this does what it's predecessor did and treats Gotham City and its inhabitants as if it was a real place. Our hero's gear and equipment have real world origins and explanations, not just something he pulls out of his utility belt and starts doing amazing things with. There are scenes of people reacting to situations as you or I would do, not a bunch of extras following the director's instructions. And there are real world complications that that many other versions of Gotham City didn't seem to have.Since there are some are some big twists the trailers and commercials avoided showing us, I'll try my best to keep this spoiler free. But the results of those twists have such a great effect on the plot I might go into detail about them, so be warned.Let's start with the thing on everyone's mind and talk about the late Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker, not the mention the character himself. This is not your father's Joker. Everything about him is changed, right down to his origin. Instead of a career criminal who fell into a vat of chemicals that altered his appearance, we have have a psychopath with unique scars wearing clown make up. There are no gimmicky weapons here: no killer laughing gas, no electrifying joy buzzers, no acid squirting flowers, no guns with BANG flags. This Joker uses a variety of guns, knives and bombs that any criminal really could find and use. And he's no longer a criminal mastermind out to get as much money as possible and have fun committing crime. He's out to cause chaos and panic for his own twisted amusement, his attacks becoming increasingly destructive and deadly as they happen in ways that rival real world terrorist attacks. Later in, he's out to make turn the people of Gotham bad, forcing common citizens to do unthinkable acts in response to his terrible demands. And Ledger brings the character to life in way no other actor has ever done or will. The rumors he may win a posthumous Oscar have much truth to them. If you're one of those people who've always thought Jack Nicholson's Joker from the 1989 ""Batman"" was over the top and cartoonish, then watch ""The Dark Knight"" for the complete opposite.But Ledger isn't the only one doing a wonderful job here. Christopher Bale remains the best Bruce Wayne/Batman ever. Micheal Caine brings both humor and sincerity to Alfred. Morgan Freeman wonderfully shows us the mind (and heart) behind the Batsuit and those weapons and equipment. Gary Oldman gives one of the best performances in his entire career as a stalwart James Gordon. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a vast improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart brings charisma and courage to his role as Harvey Dent, which makes Dent's transformation to the scarred villain Two Face all the more horrifying and tragic (something Tommy Lee Jones didn't even try to do when he played the character in 1995's ""Batman Forever""). Even anonymous characters that only get a few minutes of screen time manage to leave an impression.But be warned: this movie lives up to its PG-13 rating. The violence here is fast and brutal. And even when bullets aren't flying and bombs aren't exploding, the tension is so thick it'll take a lot more than a knife to cut it. There are several jump out of your seat moments and some fairly disturbing scenes. During the last 30 minutes or so, I was on the edge of my seat, my heart constantly pounding and my eyes wide as I hoped for the best but expected the worse. If you have young Bat-Fans, you might want to pause before taking them to see this, or buying the DVD for them when it comes out. Even though the movie has toys and snack food tie ins, I wouldn't let a child under 11 or 12 see this. I imagine even some adult viewers won't be able to sit trough it without squirming in their seats a few times.My one true complaint is that ""The Dark Knight"" maybe TOO good, setting the mark a little too high for future Batman Movies. Even if they could find someone to replace Ledger to bring back the Joker, I'm not sure that actor could possibly fill the large shoes left to fill.""I think you and I are destined to do this forever"" The Joker leers at Batman at one point. If only that were true..."
7654,True,Must say that i've never seen a movie as great as this one. The Dark Knight blew my mind totally. The performance of every actor in this movie is amazing. Should give an Oscar to each of them. But what really caught my eye was the performance of Heath Ledger. Has anyone ever taken a roll as serious as Heath did. He was so in to the roll of the Joker. I'm not just saying this cause he's dead. But that performance is the greatest of all time and I consider Heath to be the greatest actor that ever lived. He proved in The Dark Knight that he could be an actor that we've never seen in the entire history of actors. And The Dark Knight is a new step in the movies of superheroes. The script for this movie is a masterpiece. You can feel the adrenalin pump in every scene in this movie.
7655,True,"Batman vs The Joker.Of all the villains in Batman history, The Joker is the most famous. And, as was teased at the end of Batman Begins, he takes his bow here in what is the darkest, intelligent, action packed superhero movie ever made.Written by Christopher Nolan, along with his brother Jonathan and from a story idea from David S. Goyer, The Dark Knight is a movie bursting at the seams with ideas and plots. Christopher Nolan cited the movie HEAT as a major influence on The Dark Knight and that can clearly be seen. This movie is not simply dominated by Batman or The Joker. There are other plots going on here. Lt. Gordon trying to do the best he can with cops who may be working for him and the mobsters in Gotham. Harvey Dent, the new DA is beginning a crusade to clean Gotham up. Bruce Wayne see Dent as an opportunity to get out of being Batman if Dent manages to clean the city up. As for the Joker, well he simply wants to bring law and order crashing down. And destroy the Batman in the process.Let's begin with the obvious. Heath Ledger is sensational as The Joker. It's a performance that dominates the movie. His origin is never explained. He simply exists to bring chaos to Gotham. He is in many ways Batman's opposite. Ledger completely looses himself in the role, and blows away the performance of Jack Nicholson from Burton's Batman movie.But as good as Ledger is, Bale is just as good. Trying to understand a man like the Joker, and hoping to give up the Batman role and bet it all on Dent, Bale excels. He allows some humour in some scenes as Bruce Wayne (which I didn't think he got in Begins). And again as Batman he terrorizes the mob. However, he discovers that the Joker isn't as easy to intimidate as so-called normal villains.Gary Oldman gets more to do here than he did in Begins. And he's more than up to the task. James Gordon is a rare character in the Batman mythology. He's one of the few human characters who has no hidden agenda. He's a good cop trying his best in a city where no-one can seem to trust anyone else. His scenes with Batman here, and before in Begins, are very impressive. Unlike portrayals of the character before, he doesn't go running to the Batman anytime there is a problem. He's a cop and will do his job. In many ways, I've always felt he's the one man Batman respects over anyone else. And it's refreshing to see the relationship that is strong in the comic books being dealt with properly here.However the key performance here, is Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent. A man determined to clean-up his city. He gradually crumbles under the chaos that surrounds him. In fact, his tragedy as he falls from being the so-called 'White Knight' DA, to becoming the Two-Face character is the standout role here. His fate, foretold in a key line near the beginning, 'you die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself becoming the villain', could apply to most characters here. Dent becoming Two-Face, the Batman forced to become the hero that Gotham needs, but no deserve, Gordon forced to work with cops he can't fully trust.Maggie Gyllenhaal, taking over from Katie Holmes, gives a good performance as Rachel Dawes as a woman torn between two men, Dent and Wayne. It's her fate that will ultimately decide the destiny of certain characters in the movie.Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, the man who runs Wayne Industries for Bruce Wayne gives another excellent performance. He becomes almost a Q-like figure for Bruce Wayne. Michael Caine provides some much needed humour in the movie as Alfred.But this is a dark movie. Here in the UK, it's been giving a 12-A certificate. That means under 12 children can get into see it as long as they are accompanied by an adult. Some of the violence here, is brutal in places, and the make-up effects including the Two-Face make up may be a bit much for some younger children. It's also a long movie, 152 minutes. There are a couple of sequences that I feel could have been trimmed to tighten the movie up (including the impressive Hong Kong sequence).Nolan who did well handling the action in Begins, has even bigger set-pieces here and shows he's maturing as an action director. The opening robbery scene is very tightly shot. There is a brilliant sequence involving a lorry chasing a cop vehicle through the city. Only in the final confrontation do you get a little lost in the action, as Batman has to fight not only the Joker's men but cops too.But the most tense packed sequence in the movie is the two ferry dilemma. In some ways this scene shows that there may be hope for Gotham, even if it will take a long time to feel safe there.Nolan and his cast and crew have taken the comic book movie to a completely new level. This movie has more intelligent ideas than most movies, certainly of this kind, and while there is a trace of hope at the end of the movie, you don't get a happy ending. In this, the comparison to The Empire Strikes Back is fair. This is a darker movie than Batman Begins is, and while it is very enjoyable and brilliantly made, just don't expect to come out feeling good.Is it the best summer blockbuster this year? Certainly. Is it better than Batman Begins? Yes. Is it the best comic book movie ever? Without a doubt."
7656,True,"""Where do we...begin?""I've gotta' say this.....""THIS MOVIE MOVED ME!""And I'll tell you why.... Pretty much from day one I followed the making of this movie, whether it be on ""Batman-On-Film"", ""youtube"" or wherever else on the internet for that matter.....Hell I even got myself a ""Dark Knight t-shirt"" I was that mad about this movie. After finally sitting down and getting myself comfy in the movie theatre the ""bank heist"" began. I had seen this scene many times before, but seeing it on the big screen was a totally different experience. The words - ""I believe that... whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you....STRANGER!!"" Will now go down as one of the many iconic lines from this movie. I had heard about THE JOKER and what he was like, but everything I'd heard, read, and seen, did not prepare me for what was to come..... THE JOKER is without doubt the NASTIEST, EVILIST, most SADISTIC piece of work I have ever seen in a movie, in any movie, and I'll tell you I've thought long and hard about this. Nothing or no-one compares to this. Every scene that THE JOKER is in has something really special about it. From his unbelievable ""pencil trick"" to his ""WHY SO SERIOUS?!"" scene, or his scene with THE BATMAN in the police cell. Listen, I could go on all day about this movie, the fact of the matter is, and the statement I am about to make, I make with no doubt, 100% confidence.....THIS IS THE BEST BATMAN MOVIE EVER MADE!! EVEN THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER MADE!!So what about the rest of the cast? Christian Bale once again reprises the role of BRUCE/THE BAT and I have read some critics groaning on about his his voice for THE BATMAN. As far as I'm concerned I think Mr Bale puts in a fantastic performance, even better than BATMAN BEGINS, and I don't think there is a better actor out there at the moment, apart from the late HEATH, but I'll come to that later. With support from Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman, and of course Aaron Eckhart. All fantastic performances! I must also compliment Christopher Nolan, and the rest of the crew for such a wonderful movie!I do, unfortunately have a couple of not so good things to say about the movie, I felt that Maggie Gyllenhaal wasn't a strong enough actress to play Rachel Dawes, and I thought the section of the film with the ""sonar"" was just a little far fetched. But, and this is a big BUT. Because I had become so fanatical about seeing this movie I knew I was going to scrutinise every last detail, I guess I even became a critic.....""THIS MOVIE MOVED ME"".....I realised that as THE JOKER hung upside down, this was some guy from Perth, Australia called HEATH LEDGER. It really hit home with me that this guy is no longer with us and his life has been cut short so tragically young. And ""NO"" I'm not saying this because he has left us, but this guy REALLY DOES DESERVE AN ""Oscar"" for this role, because you're not seeing HEATH LEDGER. You are seeing......THE JOKER!!!"
7657,True,"I'm a big fan of Batman, he's my favorite superhero. I like his animated shows, the old school show with Adam West and first two movies, made by Tim Burton. When Schumacher took the job for directing Batman Forever and Batman & Robin, I was disgusted to see what happened to my hero. Both movies sucked, but Batman still remained my favorite superhero, so I was very pleased to see Batman Begins, which was the return of the real Batman; dark, mysterious, scary and lonely knight of Gotham City. Now... The Dark Knight is something different. It's really a masterpiece, the best superhero movie I've ever seen... and the best action movie I've seen in years. TDK is mix of psychotic drama and spectacular action movie, full of intelligent dialogs, very original and stylish action, great acting and of course, the mood of the movie is excellent. TDK is much darker, disturbing and scary look of Batman and his fight against the Joker. Christian Bale is excellent as Batman / Bruce Wayne, not to mention Heath Ledger - what I liked about his performance as the Joker was the fact he didn't want to make a direct copy of Jack Nicholson's Joker, but he transformed Joker into something different and better. Aaron Eckhart is also great as Harvey Dent, Maggie Gyllenhaal was very cute and convincing. The action was really spectacular, the dialogs very smart, there was a lot of drama and action, scary moments. Overall... this movie deserves to be at number 1. I don't care for other people, who are complaining about TDK being the no.1 on IMDb TOP 250. This is the movie of this year. This is the real Batman. If you're a fan of Batman, you MUST watch this."
7658,True,"This film will be a classic before it leaves the theatre. The spectacular elements, death defying sequences, visual beauty and an actual story are just wonderful. There are enough comments out there that I do not need to go on and on, but, this film deserves all accolades, end of story. The best villain in history is now the Joker, for he is portrayed as he is not as the world would perceive him. Bravo! The batman is dark at the beginning of the film but reaches a new level of Gothic thriller without becoming bogged down by morose stereotypes. This film has one flaw and that is the rating, it is too low. This film should be rated R. The graphic violence is enough that my own mother had issues finishing the film, and the appearance of Dent after his accident as well as the magic pencil were enough to vilify this film in her eyes. I grew up with Batman as my role model, and this film supersedes my expectations."
7659,True,"Well I just saw the movie for the second time, some weeks after seeing it the first time during the opening weekend. I have to say that knowing what was coming made me pay attention to the actual content even more than the first time, and you know what? It held up, in my opinion. Surprisingly so. So all of my comments below apply, except for the one about the bit I didn't like. Still didn't like it, but appreciated it more in the overall context of the plot and character development. So what I said the first time was:This is a movie that is so complete, it actually is better than the hype (and that was a hell of a lot of hype, wasn't it?). It works on SO many levels; it actually IS a darkly philosophical, character-driven action movie. That sounds like a contradiction, but as my companion put it so nicely afterwards, the action sequences actually pushed along the plot and the character development.Philosophical? An action movie? Well, yes. Just type in the words ""good evil philosophical"" and ""Dark Knight"" into Google and you get the likes of this link, amongst 57,300 weblinks: ""The Dark Knight - A Philosophical Review"" www.gregboyd.org/blog/the-dark-knight-a-philosophical-review/ As I said, the movie works on so many levels.So why don't I give it a 10 then? Because I didn't want what happened to Rachel Dawe to have happened. Yes, it was true to the spirit of the story. Yes, it was consistent with the story, and in fact was necessary for the further development of the Harvey Dent and Bruce Wayne characters, BUT I DON'T HAVE TO LIKE IT. So there.Amendment: The second time around I was able to be prepared for the moment and appreciate its place in the film. And there was SO much more to see and to catch the second time that made the movie that much better for me (and for my friend who normally doesn't like ""action"" movies - she liked it better the second time, too).That said, this is now THE Batman movie, in fact THE action movie. It has set a new standard for the quality and the depth. I for one cannot see a third in this current sequence coming out anytime soon, because this one has done such a good job.And as I said before, it was _better_ the second time. There aren't many movies about which you can say that, except those on the ""Best of"" lists. And this certainly belongs on that list.Oh, and Heath definitely deserves at the very least a posthumous nomination for Best Supporting Actor."
7660,True,"Long ago, two otherwise good directors set on their own respective campaigns to make two Batman movies. However, the result was, in the first case, inappropriate, and in the second, disastrous.After watching Batman Begins, I was left satisfied. Nolan really took the helm of the film and gave us a better, far more developed Bruce Wayne/Batman.Looking back, Begins wasn't really that good. The emotional arc was flawless, but the plot went too slow and the action was not properly presented, with not so good or memorable villains. But I understand now that Chris Nolan and David Goyer felt rather obligated to tell the origin story, just so they could make the sequel.The Dark Knight is just excellent. Let's start with the story. Great. It's deep, mature and very realistic, and most certainly, not too fantastic or unbelievable. And, unlike any of the previous, this time there are real characters. Three characters are the gems in this movie: First, of course Batman. He's no longer the inexperienced vigilante, but more of the professional crime fighter. And his suit just gets better and better. And, at the end, he's a publicly misunderstood hero, but still chooses to protect the people. Funny, though. Batman appears less than before. The story is more focused on Harvey Dent. The district attorney who gives everything, even his safety, to eradicate crime from the streets. Now, there are several nods and hints to his character's fate that only three year olds couldn't figure out. The coin, ""his face is in it"", the oil. And still, Eckhart provides a sympathetic genuine performance. His downfall transformation into the famed Two-Face is gradual but effective, and acts as a real tragedy. And the make-up done on his second face was brilliant. Just as I remember in the animated series.But, none of these characters are so satisfying and spine tingling as, (drum role please)... The Joker. Finally! After the disgusting misinterpretation of the character Jack Nicholson made, Heath Ledger finally gives us the Joker we all remember and (ironically) love. Not only the coolest villain in years and the most intense character in ages, but also Ledger's greatest performance. He's sarcastic and a wise cracker, but also dark, sinister and a real bastard. And I love it! The Director deliberately put an inside joke in the story. When The Joker is about to fall while laughing and is ultimately saved by Batman, the Chris tells us: ""It's not Tim Burton's Joker again. We haven't seen the last of him"". Too bad for Heath's departure. I don't think it would be wise to hire someone else for the next movie. Even still, his posthumous work is the best in his career. Best Joker ever!As for the other actors, what can I say? GREAT JOB. Even Rachel Dawes, with inconspicuously switched actresses playing her and a rather expendable character, was good. Commissioner (at last) Gordon also deserves acclaim. He's not just a person in the background, he's Batman's true ally and the human monument to integrity.Alfred seems a little out of place here. He has some importance, but, just like Batman, we don't see him a lot this time. But I can't say anything bad about Michael Caine's performance.The only thing I did not enjoy was the music. Sorry, Mr Zimmer and Mr. Howard, but your score sucks! Nobody will ever beat the Danny Elfman theme.As a drama piece, it's excellent, and as an action ride, it's even better. Two words: FLYING CARS. The trailer crash was not just awesome, it was actually beautiful!Chris Nolan managed to make right everything Burton and Schumacher threw down the drain. The villains, of course. It's almost an ""F U"" to Burton, Nicholson, Schumacher and Lee Jones. ""THIS is the way you should have done it"" And the lighting, we finally left the dark cheesy sets passing for Gotham streets and saw some daylight in a real city.Christopher Nolan deserves to be thanked for the honor returned to it's rightful owner. Batman is here. In the best movie of the year. 100 out of 10 stars! Let's just hope the trilogy curse doesn't strike again."
7661,True,"As a fan of Batman since my early days i must say that this movie is, by far, the best ""comics-based"" picture ever made (and one of the best movies ever). Sure, X-Men and Spiderman have placed this kinda films on a new level - but this Batman generates something beautiful and unique! Everything is perfect - the actors, the suits, the enemies, the good guys, the ""mafia"". Nolan demonstrates the Gotham's Police corruption and the ""grey world"", not that kinda ""black/white"" maniqueism always present in this kinda stories. This is the real world, with real heroes and real villains. There are Ethics involved, moral issues - actions that determine life and death. I don't remember reading a Batman comics so good as this movie - well, maybe ""The Killing Joke"". What i want to say is: this movie is the perfect (yeah, perfect) adaptation of a Batman (or any other comics) story. Plus, it is not only a superhero story, but a marvelous and well-crafted story. I left the cinema with an uneasy feeling, a certain something that i can not describe - this movie brought to me a new light. I believe this movie should run for the Oscars - it's time for the Academy to stop being so narrow minded..."
7662,True,"Absolutely unreal. I seen the first screening in Derry yesterday and was thrust to the deepest, darkest parts of humankind. Some really scary bits in it, suspense wise, especially when the joker has the knife in that guys mouth and is explaining his scars to him. I was so intrigued and guiltily sadistic at the same time. Heath Ledger as the joker is immense. What a shame he died. I could have done with another sequel with the Joker but kudos to the man anyways. I wonder if the joker really did get to him? The special effects are class too, Harvey Dents post fire face is flawless. You could never tell it wasn't real, his exposed eye just moves exactly in time with his real one. Go see it and believe the hype! Its the best film I've ever seen and I'd go see it again and again and again. Anyone who disagrees is blaspheming."
7663,True,"I have seen many films on the first night of their release each gaining a few cheers and lots of exclamations of how great they were at the end. I saw the Dark Knight and i was completely blown away and so was the audience. Never before have i seen a cinema audience happily give a standing deafening ovation to a film but last night i go to see that! And boy did this film deserve it. For those of you who have read the batman comic books the joker that is portrayed is that of a clever and ruthless psychopath with no motives just a joy in killing. This is the joker that Heath Ledger portrayed. He was funny, he believed in what he was doing and he enjoyed it. The killings and plans were those of a mastermind, they wreaked havoc across Gotham and they brought Batman to a sense of utter desperation which can be felt by the movie audience; you want it to stop and yet you will the joker on towards his next depraved act. The writers really included some of the original sayings of the joker and his crimes such as blowing up the hospital and his saying about how he does not want batman to die, hes too much fun. This is the joker at its absolute purest and best and I'm glad that heath ledger got to go out with a bang leaving behind a role that will never be surpassed. Christian Bale was again fantastic as batman showing the desperation and anger that is batman. He is taken at every corner, he has to fight in all directions he is not given room to breathe once his counter part starts the ball rolling and he has to make the hardest decisions of his life, decisions that the majority of people wouldn't be able to. Its a shame that CB has been over shadowed by the joker as he is a truly fantastic actor and every time he is on screen you are hypnotised by him. But hopefully he is given a chance to truly shine in the next instalment which i am really looking forward to. The main characters were aided by an absolutely stellar cast, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent aka 2face was fantastic and showed the pain of loosing a loved one to the extreme, and when he is bringing Gotham into a new age of goodness you are willing him with your every breathe to succeed. Gary Oldman is even better than last time as the lovely Gordon and Michael Caine is as wise as ever as the tough talking and funny Alfred. Others included were Maggie Gylenhaal, Eric Mabius, Nestor Carbonell and Morgan Freeman amongst others. The music by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard is superb as well, i believe it is the 'Tadarida' theme from begins which i must admit i absolutely loved and unlike begins it did not overshadow the action that took place in the film. And boy is there action; car chases, one on one combat, shootouts, animal attacks and explosions, this is a film for the action junkie. If you don't like action the storyline is enough to hold it up but if you love action this will be your wet dream. It looks fantastic, not all fake and CGI like a lot of films these days and you really feel like you are there when Batman turns up kicking ass. Overall this is the film of the year, it works for those who love the comics, those who love action, those who love a good and intricate plot and it covers all the main genres of film, sad, romantic, horror are a few to name. I dare anyone to watch it and hate, you will be hard pushed to find flaws in this film!"
7664,True,"A few days ago, I believed that WALL-E was the best film of 2008. Its position has just been taken with astounding force. Batman: The Dark Knight is not only the best comic book movie ever made, with thrilling action and seamless visual effects, but it also breaks through the limitations of its genre to become so much more. It is a thought-provoking piece of crime fiction, with superb moral complexity, crackerjack dialogue and flawless performances from every cast member.Batman, the alter ego of billionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), has successfully created fear amongst Gotham's criminals. With the aid of police lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and new District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), it looks like the future for Gotham City is going to be so much brighter. Bruce might even be able to hang up the Bat-suit and get back together with his love interest Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who is currently involved with Harvey.Enter the Joker (Heath Ledger). Malicious, mad and clever, the Joker isn't like any villain Batman has faced before. He's not after money or fame. He is, as he states in the film, ""an agent of chaos"". He is out to show that even the most civilised people will break their moral codes when they are threatened enough, even Batman. When the Joker declares that people will die every day until Batman reveals his true identity, Bruce must question his own morality and whether he will be able to fight a person who has nothing to lose...The bulk of hype surrounding the movie concerns the late Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. Let me say that this isn't so much a performance as a full embodiment of sadistic, intelligent evil. Every sparkling word of praise that you have heard for Ledger's portrayal is true. Ledger delivers an unforgettable portrayal which is full of confidence and passion. He is darkly funny, captivating and downright terrifying. This Joker is right up there with Hannibal Lecter as one of the all-time great movie villains. When you hear critics saying that Ledger's portrayal is potentially iconic, they're being dead serious. It's just a shame that such a talent was taken before he could craft more amazing portraits for us to admire.Though Ledger swipes the film without any doubt, the supporting cast are still given the opportunity to shine, which they all do. After Ledger, the best performance comes from Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, Gotham's White Knight. Eckhart's acting is emotionally riveting, peeling away the layers of his character to reveal a determined, yet flawed man who fights against injustice with the same good heart as Batman, but who is trapped within the confines of the law. It is Eckhart's brilliant turn which transforms a well-written character into a true flesh-and-blood hero, and which makes Dent's eventual downfall all the more tragic. As Bruce Wayne/Batman, Christian Bale delivers another haunting portrait of the iconic hero, and makes sure that the audience knows who is under the mask. In Tim Burton's original Batman, Batman is overshadowed by the Joker. Here, Bale and Ledger play off each other wonderfully, creating a sense of tension and making us question who's going to come out on top. Gary Oldman is once again on top form as Jim Gordon, whilst Maggie Gyllenhaal is a much needed improvement over the comparatively bland Katie Holmes from Batman Begins in the role of Rachel Dawes. In returning roles, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine once again bring wit, grace and warmth to their performances, as well as some good laughs. Finally, look out for a solid supporting turn from Eric Roberts as crime boss Salvatore Maroni.With Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan proved that he could direct a smart, brilliant and imaginative comic book movie. Here, he has not only repeated the task, but proved that he is one of the most visionary directors around. Nolan pushes the boundaries of the genre with this film, daring to take chances and add some ambition to the mix. He asks serious questions which involve the audience on a more thoughtful level than most comic book movies, whilst not skipping on the spectacle that many people expect from a Batman movie. Concerning the action scenes, Nolan has improved immensely. The gripping bank heist which opens the film is a perfect start to a film which is jam-packed with intelligent thrills. A high-speed pursuit between Batman on his Batpod (an extremely cool bike) and the Joker in a semi-truck is simply explosive, and the climax of the film is spectacularly intense. Christopher Nolan also co-writes the faultless screenplay with his brother Jonathan, weaving the complex story with commendable grace and intelligence. All of the characters are written with care, and the dialogue (except when considering the Joker, as is expected) is realistic and full of humanity.Technically, the film is top-notch. Whenever visual effects are used (such as the powerhouse job done on the film's second major villain, Two-Face, which is also accomplished with terrific make-up), they blend in so well with their environment that you won't even notice them. The locations, such as Chicago and Hong Kong, provide powerful essence and are also used as more than just backgrounds, as they all have their own distinct character. The stunts are exceptional, as is the musical score. This is so much more that what I had expected. The Dark Knight is not only the jewel in the crown for the Batman series, but it is one of the best sequels ever made, ranking alongside The Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the King. With The Dark Knight, the Nolan brothers, Ledger and co. have not only delivered based upon the mountain of hype surrounding the film. They have also made a boundary-pushing, exemplary and soaring movie which will hopefully be remembered both as a classic and a magnificent swansong for an incredibly talented actor."
7665,True,"Not a bad movie, genuinely enjoyable.Batman was well acted by Bale. Ledger was fine as the Joker, but the raving some are giving about his performance borders on masturbation. It looks like he enjoyed the part. Maggie Gyllenhaal was slightly disappointing. She didn't show any particular chemistry with either of her love interests.I'm surprised that the Nolan brothers didn't subscribe a better musical score for this movie. The Dark Knight wasn't nearly as gripping as their previous movie, The Prestige (also starring Bale).TDK isn't without its plot holes. What was the fate of the businessman Lau? What did The Joker do to the hostages after Batman jumped from the window to save Dawes? The cell-phone sonar seemed daft. It was unnecessary and could easily have been cut from the movie without damaging the script in any way. It only seemed to provide Freeman with an opportunity to behave in a corny, self-righteous manner. Weak.The fight scenes were *much* better in Batman Begins. All the mêlée in TDK seemed dark and confusing. Perhaps that was the point, but the fighting in BB was really fun to watch. I could make similar comments about the Batmobile scenes which were also much better in the first movie.Still a good movie though, got me genuinely excited at some points, but not worthy of a 10/10 rating by any stretch of the imagination."
7666,True,"This is the best comic book adaption ever since it has the best comic book villain in it, it's not really about bale here, bale said himself heath is the star of this movie, funny thing how close life comes to death, in a way movies are just propaganda for the hidden truth. That there is more and you gotta find your destiny like Batman and Heath who gave us a joker to be remembered. A new era is coming, change is coming. chaos = the Joker will bring us this new era ! ;-) like volcano's bring chaos and then new life! This movie breaks all records like a sledge hammer, #1 spot here, you can call me a joker but life isn't coincidence, it's perfectly balanced out and we are the main part of it! It's perfect in way; cause it's not, it has it's own life outside of Batman Begins... this movie, The Joker, the music it just owns.and the night is darkest before dawn.10 out of 10"
7667,True,"This movie is plain and simple...amazing and terrific. It is hands down the best movie I have seen all year. I enjoyed every minute of it and hoped it would never end. Heath Ledger did an amazing job and I am upset over his death. He could have done more great movies and great things in his lifetime. How they killed Rachel was harsh but real. Aaron Eckhart's role as Harvey Dent was awesome acting. I also think that the #1 on the Top 250, isn't an exaggeration. It was without a doubt worth my time and money. I thought that Heath Ledger's acting was also amazing. He brought a creepy, silliness to the screen. Him disguised as a nurse got a chuckle out of me. Everyone in this movie did a great job in both acting and film making. I enjoyed every minute of this film and hope to see more Batman."
7668,True,"I have waited something like 2 years for this movie. I loved the first one and had high, very very high, expectations for this movie. The expectations were surpassed in every single aspect.Let me start by saying that this is a true visual masterpiece. Michelangelo painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Mozart wrote his 25th. So I have to think in those kind of terms to try and describe how great this movie looks. Starting with the Joker. He looks great. Not quite what we were used to, but perhaps that is what makes it intriguing, scary and always fascinating to watch. The city of Gotham looks great. It makes it so very believable that it is actually a real city. It looks bright at day, dark at night; sad when it should look sad, dark when it should look dark. Everything fits perfectly about the town. The new gadgets (new suit, new motorcycle, the underground cave) have an awesome look to it without it looking geeky or weird. Once again everything fits perfectly, as it should with this perfect movie.The acting is incredible. Michael Caine plays Alfred as the always humble but wise butler of batman. Except in this movie he is not a butler. Or an assistant of anything like that. He is more like an wise man who batman can always count on when he is feeling insecure or misplaced. Christian Bale did a great job being batman. In the last movie he had the leading role and did this brilliant. In this movie he is at least equal to that, and from my opinion (during the difficult scenes he mastered perfect) even better. Maggie Gyllenhaal is always cute, smart and sexy. So it was wise choosing her to play Rachel Dawes. She actually did this a lot better than (the a bit boring and shallow) Katie Holmes. And now I come to the thing that makes this movie a masterpiece in a trillion ways: Heath Ledger. He was always known for putting his heart and his soul in every role he played. This movie proves that. He ended his acting career with (here it comes, the big one) the greatest acting performance anyone has ever made in the film history, and every role in the future that will be equal, or better, is inspired by Heath Ledger, and by this role in particular. I cried because this role touched me like no role anyone ever played ever had. I was shaking because his performance was so horrifying, so creepy, and so incredibly believable. He mastered and ruled every scene he was in. The voice was perfect, the choreography and the way he moved and talked, was magnificent. He makes Jack Nicholsons role of the Joker look shallow. Ledger was superb. He was great. May he rest in peace. Aaron Eckhart was great. He played very convincing and the way he played the good Harvey Dent and the Bad Two face without playing an entirely diffirent character, was impressive. Great job. Ervery actor was superb: Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Nestor Carbonell and Anthony Michael Hall. They all were magnificent. But the thing I noticed is Eric Roberts. And the way he actually played a decent movie. Sorry for his fans, but normally I can't stand this guy. He is annoying, looks (misplaced) arrogant in every character he plays and has never been more than an average actor. A bit below average actually. However, in this movie he was pretty cool. The one movie where every actor outstands him or herself, he does too. Thank god because it would be a shame if he screwed up this movie.Finally, the plot was nice too. Oh nice, what am I saying, it was beautiful. It carried the movie from the first minute to the last. The feel in this movie was perfect and Christopher Nolan can be known as one of the best directors of all time. Beyond Hitchcock, Tim Burton, Francis Ford Coppola and many others. He could have probably make this movie last about 5 hours. Hell, I still would have loved it. The way the movie begins, the way everything fits like a puzzle, and (this I think is the best twist in movie history) the way you think it is over (The Joker is behind bars, right?) and suddenly it lasts another hour.Practically everyone talks about this as the best comic movie ever. Or: the best movie of 2008. So now let me redefine that: This is the best movie of all time. It is perfect. There is nothing that has touched this and nothing else will, for ages. This is the best movie in the world. Period."
7669,True,"Wow. Just Wow. This films amazing, not just as a superhero movie but as a movie period. Christian Bale does an excellent job as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Morgan Freeman does an excellent job as Wayne's technology guy, almost everybody does a great job in the film except for Lt. Gordons family, gosh his bratty kid was annoying.Now Heath Ledger's performance deserves a section to itself, I would be more than happy to sign any petition for him to get a posthumous Oscar, it's a shame he had to die so prematurely and as soon as his career was beginning to start. Because trying to top a role originally done by Jack Nicholson is not easy at all, but Ledger does it. He brings to the Joker a disturbing and confused character, but nonetheless human at the same time.Kudos should also go to director Christopher Nolan for making a radical departure from different superhero films, Batman is not trying to save the ""good people of Gotham"" the people of Gotham are selfish and greedy and ready to kill one another for survival. Batman himself is not portrayed as a hero.All in all The Dark Knight was a great film."
7670,True,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about The Dark Night? Nevertheless, I'll throw in my two cent anyway. The story was plotted tightlyno loose ends. The suspense the acting was top notch. By the way, you had so many familiar faces in the movies. I w so thrilled to see quite about of Black actors in there as well. Tank you Mr. Nolan for making it a multicultural movie. It reflected the people of this day and age. The humor was unexpected but didn't overshadow the dark tone of the movie. Christian Bale as Batman you can't go wrong. A new Rachel Dawes, acted by Maggie Gyllenhall was a perfect choice. She gave the role honesty. All of the actors melted into their characters especially heath Ledger. This isn't a posthumous I love heath diatribe. I'm going to be as honest about my feeling of his portrayal as the Joker as I possibly can. His passing was untimely-a tragic stupid accident, but that in no way taints my opinion of his acting. He surprised me in monster's ball. He didn't surprise me in DK. Why? Because he was a good actor. Period! I forgot Heath Ledger was on the screen. I saw a raving, psychopath sporting green hair and wearing a purple morning coat. Hey, he matched at least. Does he deserve an Oscar? Maybe, maybe not. All I know is he didn't channel Jack Nicholson, and that was appreciated. Watch for the nurse. You'll see what I mean. The old guard such as Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and my Gary Oldman were top notch. Goldman as the harried Commish Gordon left me on the edge of my seat. That scene when trying to catch the Joker before he inadvertently perpetrated mass murder left me breathless. Aaron Eckhardt as the tragic Two Face left me sad. I wanted to see more of him as Two-Face. Oh well. This was a character study on psychosis, morality and how far you the ordinary citizen will go for justice. You won't be disappointed, and yes this movie raised the bar on comic book hero movies. Hopefully, Wolverine, Watchmen and Superman 2 will be up to par."
7671,True,"When I left the cinema, I wasn't happy with the movie, nor sad with it. I felt a strange sensation, which I've never felt after watching a movie before (maybe a tiny bit after Batman Begins). Nolan didn't make this film for the fighting scenes, the humorous remarks or anything mainstream like that. This is an exploration of human morality and sense of justice.*Tiny Spoiler Incoming*Heath Ledger as The Joker is the perfect villain for this, the pointless amount of chaos and anarchy he creates completely shakes the foundation of Batmans crime fighting crusade and Nolan manages to turn this into a cinematic masterpiece.*Tiny Spoiler End*This movie is worthy of #1 on IMDb."
7672,True,"A truly amazing film. I myself make up my own top ten list, and to get on that one requires a lot of film-making skill, and this one ranks #1 not by far, since number 2 is No Country For Old Men. Both were very intense. For instance: When the Joker is hanging upside down and talking to Batman how Gotham will come to hate him. And some of the confrontation scenes could relate to No Country for Old Men because when The Joker ends up nearly killing Rachel Dawes, he first confronts her and nearly kills her. Another thing would probably be when Two-Face flips coins on deaths of people, before when he was Harvey Dent he used a coin with two heads saying he created his own luck. The end would not make sense to younger children, though they should even be seeing the movie anyways - too dark - it is a very god one. Another relation to No Country, the ending is not the happiest. But this one almost promises a sequel. Heath Ledger's performance in this movie is truly his greatest, and sadly his last. He delves completely into the character, and shows how truly psychopathic and dangerous the character can be. Part of this movie is about facing one's self. Coming to terms with your darker side. What makes you do the wrong think. In this movie not only Batman, but his alter ego Bruce Wayne is beginning to lose the ability to do whats right. One of the reasons for a need of a sequel is because what happened to Bruce Wayne is not explained and How Batman will truly face himself and actions. One of the other points of this movie has to do with a person's drive to live. How people will choose themselves over others. How low and ugly a person can. The Joker lowers Harvey Dent - The White Knight of Gotham City - into the horrific villain Two-Face. The transformation from Harvey to Two-Face is very disturbing and overall an unforgettable experience. When Rachel Dawes was killed by The Joker, Harvey Dent was changing into Two-Face. And when he captures Lieutenant turned Commissioner Jim Gordan's family for revenge against Gordan's inability to rescue Rachel in time, he becomes truly lost, wanting him to feel exactly what he did, and he does. After this confrontation,when Batman comes into play, Batman is not ready to face himself for himself letting Harvey taking the fall for himself not turning into the Joker and be arrested and letting five and nearly six people die, he runs away, with Gordan's final haunting words ""He is The Dark Knight"""
7673,True,"I have always been a fan of Batman. Though I never really read many of the comics I liked the fact that Batman was not supernatural; he was just a man; the danger is real to him. With other superheros like Superman or Spiderman; they can endure a lot of punishment because they have superpowers but Batman is just like us, he's just decided to do something about the injustice of the world.With that in mind, I was blown away by ""Batman Begins"" because it wasn't just another Batman sequel; it completely reinvented the hero. Whats more, the movie was good and aside from the obvious aspects, it could have passed for a regular action movie instead of a superhero movie. So I greatly anticipated the next film.""The Dark Knight"" did not disappoint. The storyline was complex and captivating. The special effects were great and better yet, they weren't all CGI. The acting was superb.Christian Bale, in my opinion is the best Batman and he continues to portray a Bruce Wayne/Batman who is still conflicted about his role in society.Heath Ledger gave perhaps his best performance as The Joker and I say that as a skeptic when I first heard he was going to be playing The Joker. Yes, there may be a lot of hype about him due to his passing but don't let that fool you, his performance is amazing. The Joker is scary...scary in that you don't know what he's capable of doing. He's a true psychopath. His jokes have you laughing one minute and his actions will have you cringing the next. He's a bit like Hannibal Lecter in that aspect and that's what makes Ledger's portrayal so great.Aaron Eckhart gives a great performance as Harvey Dent/Two Face. He inspires you as the brave DA and then inspires sympathy for his fall. All the rest of the cast is just as good as these three main actors. Spoilers below:The Nolan brothers do a great job in this film, they really do. One example is that I truly believed that they had killed LT Gordon off and I couldn't believe it. The audience clapped when he revealed himself in the trap to catch The Joker and when we see Gordon show up at his home and see his wife and son react to his still being alive; that's the type of drama that just wasn't there for the earlier Batman films.I will say that I wanted a better ending. I wanted The Joker to die; instead he was left hanging there, presumably for the SWAT team to take into custody and presumably to bring him back in another film. Of course Ledger passed on and I have no clue how they could possibly replace him in the role. I also thought the last fight between Batman and The Joker should have been longer with more combat though I understand the real fight was more of a spiritual fight; for the soul of Gotham and whether or not the citizens had given in to the fear that The Joker inspired. When The Joker said ""you and me could do this forever"" to Batman, I agreed and I would still be watching them!All that said, I do intend to see it again and yes that means I'll drop another $10-15 at the theater but I think this movie is worth it and it's hard to say that these days."
7674,True,"When I bought an advance ticket for The Dark Knight about a month before its release date, I knew I was making a very wise decision. This film was much more highly anticipated than Cloverfield, and I don't blame the fans. If you're reading this after you just read the comments from the people who hated the movie, DON'T LISTEN TO THEM. Believe me, this is not a boring movie in any way. Yes, I'll agree that it surfaces more on the plot, but that's a good thing. Heath Ledger gave the best performance I've ever seen in a motion picture. He really deserves that Best Supporting Actor Academy Award. Also, the action in the film is amazing. What's also amazing is the way the makers succeeded in creating the absolute dark tone of the film. This is a very dark movie. (It's all in the title.) If you're worried about younger kids seeing the movie, give it a shot. I can see some kids becoming fearful of the menacing Joker. Yet, I can see others staring up at the big screen in awe. Now, about the Joker. To me, he seems more like a terrorist than a villain. He enjoys people suffering more than things like money. However, it's still a great performance. Let's move on to Harvey Dent a.k.a. Two-Face. Before the gruesome transformation, Harvey Dent (played by Aaron Eckhart) was highly appreciated by the people of Gotham city. He was known as ""Gotham's White Knight."" He was also dating Bruce Wayne's (Christian Bale) former lover Rachael Dawes. (Played by Maggie Gyllenhaal.) Now, some people say that Maggie Gyllenhaal is an upgrade from Katie Holmes, who played the same character in 2005's Batman Begins. She was good, but I liked Katie Holmes better. (See the movie, then see how you feel.) Ahh, Two-Face. What a great villain. What else is great about Two-Face is the extremely disgusting and realistic CGI half of his face. Right now, you might be thinking, ""I'll bet we don't see a lot of Two-Face. Right after it shows his face, it'll cut away and we'll never see him again."" WRONG. You get to see Two-Face's ugly half so many times, it's not even funny. (Don't look for it on YouTube.) Don't look for the movie on the internet either. It's so much better on the big screen. Not the small pix-elated screen. SEE IT."
7675,True,"I could use words like ""epic"", ""a masterpiece"", ""brilliant"", or several other clichés to describe this movie (I guess I just did), however one indication that a movie transcends to a level that cannot merely be defined in words is when it simply sticks with you.The Dark Knight sticks with you.A day after seeing Christopher Nolan's second installment in the ""Batman"" franchise, I find my mind wandering to various scenes and events in the picture that literally affected my subconscious. It is truly rare when a film can generate that kind of immersion... but this is one of those examples.As many other commenter's have mentioned, the cast all deliver excellent performances. I will also concede that Heath Ledger is indeed phenomenal as The Joker. However, the one performance that will likely get a fraction of the recognition it deserves is Aaron Eckhart at Harvey Dent/Two-Face. By comparison, Ledger's character intentionally has very little depth; we get no back story on the Joker's origins, nor any explanation of his motivations... but that was the point. The Joker represents chaos and anarchy, a soulless psychopath who just wants to ""watch the world burn."" From that perspective, it works very well. Eckhart, on the other hand, had the remarkable task of playing a character that starts out as ""Gotham's White Knight"", but slowly descends into a character full of hatred and vengeance because of the terrible tragedy that he endured. All the while sharing the screen with a Gotham villain that, by nature, ""steals the show"". Unlike the Joker, you can truly empathize with Harvey Dent's motivations... he is horrifying, yet draws a great deal of sympathy. Dent is the quintessential tragic hero, and Eckhart completely pulls it off. The real clincher, though, was the absolutely fantastic makeup/CG for Two-Face. I can say without exaggeration, that it is both shockingly haunting and believable at the same time... which is likely why that image still lingers in the back of my mind.As a whole though, The Dark Knight pulls you in and never lets go. Perhaps it is fitting that Nolan chose not to include ""Batman"" in the title, because this movie could have functioned even without such a well-known protagonist. It is more a crime drama with DC characters injected into it, than a story built entirely around them. That's not to say that the characters take a back seat, however their personality traits and origins serve as inspiration for something even larger.The Dark Knight puts Christopher Nolan among Hollywood's most elite directors. Dare I say it; he may have even undone the seemingly reputable damage to the ""Batman"" name that ""Batman and Robin"" caused. Forget those other movies, Nolan's Batman will be the one to remember."
7676,True,"I have honestly never seen a movie that amazed me like this one did. I thought I had seen some pretty intense movies, such as Fight Club, The Shawshank Redemption, American History X...this movie tops all of them, without a doubt. The acting is electrifying, the action is mind blowing and the characters are incredibly believable.Heath Ledger is amazing as The Joker. Christian Bale is yet again amazing as Batman. I saw this in the theater a couple nights back, I walked out just pumped. I will see this again, if not in theater then I'm gonna buy it when it comes out on DVD.Watch this movie...Love this movie...10/10"
7677,True,"It is dark and disturbing and worth every penny. A great movie should be about the characters and the story, not the special effects, stunts and other tricks.Christian Bale: a good performance given the script. After the evolution into Batman in the first movie, he seems a little too willing to just give up the alter ego because he doesn't understand the Joker. In the first movie, Alfred warned him that he was getting lost in this ""monster"" he had created - that angle would be far more interesting than throwing his hands in the air over him. Still, there is some interesting philosophy here regarding Wayne's unwillingness to cross the line into being the executioner - and the extraordinary attempts to rescue hostages while also not permanently damaging police officers towards the end is the apparent result. But I would like to see Batman revert to the behaviors more like an animal of ""Batman Begins"" like crouching in the dark as if waiting to pounce, and more fist-fighting and jumping off rooftops.Bruce, Alfred and Lucius Fox: I enjoyed watching the development of their relationship. Alfred continues his reluctant role as the dutiful butler who really is companion to Bruce because of the prior relationship with his father. And Morgan Freeman was awesome in a scene where he calls the bluff of a Wayne Enterprises employee who thinks he's going to bribe Bruce Wayne. But why they allow someone outside the inner circle access to the books of the front for Batman's technical needs is never explained, never really corrected and is a major error in the story. As carefully contrived as this grand plan was in ""Batman Begins,"" one would think the secret would have been more secure than this.OK, next: Rachel Dawes. I DESPISED her character in ""Begins."" She was such a b****, bossy, presumptuous, sanctimonious, condescending. I was so disappointed at the end of ""Begins"" when she rejected Bruce instead of him telling her to take a flying leap. After all he had been through, he should have dumped her like a bad habit. At least her character was nicer in ""The Dark Knight."" A flatter performance, but she did not annoy me. They did a good job finding a decent actress who looked a lot like a little older Katie Holmes to maintain some continuity between movies.And finally, just like everybody else I have to say Heath Ledger as the Joker made the movie. Far and away better than Nicholson. Not just the silly sort of crazy from ""Batman"" of '89, but truly demented psychosis. My 16-year-old niece wanted to see this because of him for 16-year-old girl reasons; I was never a fan of Heath Ledger. His performance here was incredible. I don't think it crossed my mind once who the actor was; I believed every bit of his chaos-loving creepiness. I don't think anybody will ever be able to top this performance. The ""Dark Knight"" ends with an opening for a return of the Joker in a future film, but since Mr. Ledger is no longer able to fill that role, they should let it rest in peace with him. There were plenty of other villains from the comics that could make appearances without having to try to force someone else to fill Ledger's shoes.I am pleasantly surprised by the depth of philosophy presented. Most action movies these days are just eye-candy. Wow everybody with special effects and fight scenes, and morons flock to the movies without any further thought given to story. Reasons for the violence are seldom fully explained and typically are not expected, just shut off the brain and watch the carnage. So I'm impressed that although a character like the Joker almost would not need a reason, he explains his demented self nonetheless. One could argue, of course, that his explanation was a lie. But it still goes further than most in contemplating something deeper than you're seeing an explosion because explosions sell tickets.I'm all for riveting action, but some of these fight scenes were actually too quick. But the motorcycle was awesome, and how it came into being was better still. Not just a contraption Fox is requested to create, it demonstrated a weakness in the Batman toolbox that emphasized the human side of the hero: Batman's gadgets can fail. The will to act supersedes training or technology. Definitely should show that more often. The scene in Asia involved a ""Mission Impossible""-style stunt, and I hope to see more of that in future installments. After all, part of the Batman mystique involves his ability to ""fly."" This one was more cerebral than muscular, and a delicate balance is to be achieved.My wife tells me someone on a news or talk show commented that she didn't ""get it."" LOL There's a surprise! Morons and bimbos can expect to enjoy this for the action, intense hostage situation, and even some brief comedy without noticing too much logic and reasoning - just tune out some of the dialog and they'll be OK.All you parents who are upset this thing wasn't made for kids, get over it. Just because it started as a comic doesn't mean the director should have to make it kid-friendly. Leave them with grandma for a night and go see it on a date with your spouse. This is not for the kids, and that's WHY IT'S SO GOOD."
7678,True,"There's not much left to say, everyone here's already said it. I'd just suggest seeing this film a few times. In the first viewing the movie overwhelmed. In subsequent viewings I had a chance to catch the details that really make it special. The facial expressions of Ledger's Joker; the little mocking moue he pulls after his interrogation-room guard answers that 6 of his friends had been killed and his brief pause as he plumbs his dark mind for his next words calculated to break the officer. The hysterical glee, that seemed to have little to do with acting, as the Joker tells the interrogating Batman that he does not want him dead. Just about every word this creature says is a lie, the only literary creation to even approach this Joker's essence of pure evil is Lucifer. And for all his heroism and his having survived the film's moral minefield Bale's Batman leaves off alone and seeming essentially doomed.Nolan has created a visceral, three-dimensional, fully realized Gotham, I could so easily see myself living there, then turns it into a battlefield for warring gods.There is something mythic in this production that for me only increases on subsequent viewing. Pretty magnificent stuff!"
7679,True,"After seeing Batman Begins, I was blown away by the cast, by the new batman who by the way is hear to stay in Christian Bale. The villain was a little weak, but the movie had a heavy amount of action. It was a thrilling experience. I was expecting the sequel to be much better. And It was, but it was perfect. Something I didn't expect because nothing is perfect, but this movie was. I was a little worried about Heath Ledger and Maggie Gyllenhaal joining The Dark Knight cast, buy boy did they come out firing. Heath Ledger's performance was outstanding. It's a shame he died before the release of this movie. He will never know how much he made this movie successful. He gave suspense, action, giggles, everything the list is endless. The Joker made your mouth drop in shock, specially with the deaths of Commissioner Gordon and Rachel. I like others didn't see that coming. Harvey Dent the district attorney becomes Two Face, that was a shock too. The ending though surprised me. The joker didn't die, maybe they'll make a sequel or maybe it was just appropriate that he didn't die because of the death of Ledger. Either way. It was spectacular. I don't think anyone in this world will not welcome a sequel.There is everything that a movie needs. An exceptional cast, a great director, a story line, and a ton of twists that make you happy, cry, scream, and making your jaw drop in shock.It is guaranteed that this movie will make a ton of money, but it will go down as not one of the best, but the best."
7680,True,"I went into this movie (which was completely full btw) with high expectations and that's exactly what I got!!! It was amazing!!! Plus it was so much better than Batman Begins, which was in my opinion one of the worst superhero movies of all time. The special effects were incredible, especially in the scene where the Joker is chasing down Harvey Dent and Batman makes the Joker's huge truck tip over and crash! Also, the makeup for Harvey Dent when he becomes Two Face was great and it looked so real. The makeup for the Joker was also great and added a lot to the character. You really thought he was a psychopath and you could not tell that that was Heath Ledger. But that was one of many awesome things about this movie.The cast of this movie couldn't have been more perfect. Christian Bale made you really feel what Bruce Wayne was going through and made a very good and tough Batman. The chemistry between him and Heath Ledger (the Joker) was incredible..especially in the interrogation scene between them. Heath Ledger almost scared me to death as the Joker..so I guess that means he did a good job lol. About all this Oscar buzz he's getting..I don't know if Ledger's performance was Oscar worthy. He could however get like a memory Oscar or a lifetime achievement Oscar. Looking back, I think that Ledger's Joker was the best thing about the movie. He could do both comedy and villainy so easily and he gave some of the funniest lines in the movie..like the whole ""I can make this pencil disappear"" scene and when he said to Batman ""You complete me"" (He was from Brokeback Mountain, so that's why it's funny!) Aaron Eckhart was mush better than I expected. I thought he would be like his character in Thank You For Smoking, which was kinda plain. But he brought a lot of emotion and passion to Harvey Dent and Two Face. Two Face was not as scary as The Joker....but that's OK! Maggie Gyllenhaal (who is one of my favorite actresses) was SOOO good as Rachel Dawes...and I'm so happy she replaced that no talent lowlife Katie Holmes. With Gyllenhaal, I could really feel like I was seeing a real Rachel and a strong woman, unlike Holmes. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine gave a lot of very funny lines too and they were great.OK...there were some bad things. I did not get how Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) was brought back to life and how they did that. I also didn't like that Rachel died (part of which cuz i loved Gyllenhaal so much)..but I guess they needed it in order to bring in Two Face. Overall, there were not a lot of bad things. Everything was amazing! It was a very long movie..but I guess super cool action-packed superhero movies like this should be! Whoever hasn't seen this movie yet...Definitely SEE IT!! It is soo worth all the hype that it's gotten and it's a must must see!"
7681,True,"People here who say they hated this movie sound a little jealous? Not sure why but it is in no way a bad film although not the masterpiece the hype has built. It is filmed very well, great editing, rich colors and shadows and is light years above the two Tim Burton movies although I like them a lot (the later ones really sucked).But there are issues.HERE'S THE BAD - why is the Scarecrow in this in the beginning for like two minutes? Here he's not even the Scarecrow any more just a guy with a mask and is with a team of supposed do-gooders? Didn't he go nuts in the first movie? Kind of a pointless scene. Which leads me to another point, too many sub-plots, sub-characters, etc, which is why it runs about 20 min too long.I'm sorry but Maggie Gyllenhaal is real tough to look at. She is not a pretty lady and compared to Katie Holmes an actual dog. I hate to sound piggish but she is a distraction, I don't feel for her as a character and her acting is so sluggish and dull you almost hope she gets it to get her off the screen. One line the Joker has to her is ""hello beautiful"" and ""and you are beautiful"" which was laughable. Why a billionaire like Wayne who trots around with models would be into her is stupid, it's hard to believe Holmes is only a year younger.Why are they obviously in Chicago? Gotham City is NYC.Batman changes his voice so dramatically from that of Bruce Wayne's it is frankly annoying and you can barely understand him half the time. Also his character is not very interesting this time around, the action is great but he is dull as Wayne.The plot is a bit silly because of the outrageously bad police work going on, Gotham's finest seemed to be fooled at every turn, they can't keep one guy in a cell and who's ranks are so corrupted no one can be trusted, it got a bit dumb after a while.NOW THE GOOD. Heath Ledger is really great as The Joker, he puts a twist on it that is really creepy and he should get an Oscar nod, dead or not. The Joker himself is not a very threatening guy in theory but his ways and means to go to the ultimate levels of nuts made the whole film possible. Only I was disappointed with no end shot of him in the asylum in a straight jacket. Also Two Face's build up was very good, Aaron Eckhart did a fine job, but it is a little strange that he died so quick as he has been in the comics books for many a turn.All in all a fun time at the movies, well worth the price of admission. Good and dark the way batman should be.BTW This is not for kids at all, I saw several people leave during it with little kids, this is why they have ratings morons. No, your kid is not different or smarter. I mean 5 guys get killed in the first 5 minutes alone, some very brutal violence, this is not Batman circa 1967. I would say ten is old enough."
7682,True,"When people think comic book movie, they think cheesy stunts and lines with the ""get the girl"" ending; but not The Dark Knight. The late Heath Ledger truly brings something riveting to the screen that's enough to put even Hopkins's performance in Silence of the Lambs to shame.The film eases into the plot slowly, but reaches a constant state of climax that keeps the viewer glued to the screen. Ledger's take on the Joker is much different than the one portrayed by Jack Nicholson in the 1989 Batman film. Ledger's Joker strikes a fear in the hearts of viewers because he is based more in reality than fiction, having depths and traits to his personality that are associated more with real-life psychopaths and schizophrenics than fantasy villains. It is for this reason that the Joker in The Dark Knight is considered terrifying, and Ledger delivers the character so beautifully that he steals the screen from Oldman and Bale.All and all, this movie easily deserves a 10/10. It is also the first movie that I've seen where the hype didn't even compare to the quality of the movie itself. A definite classic for generations to come."
7683,True,"If any movie has deserved a perfect 10, this would be it.The Dark Knight got everything right, perfect acting, perfect script, pefect action, dialouge, just all perfect.The Movie was long, But it was a ""good"" long, when you've been sitting there for a long time watching it, but you don't want it to end.i don't want to say anything that can spoil it, i just want you to GO SEE THIS MOVIE, everyone in the world should see it, its the best sequel ever, best batman movie, comic book movie, and best all out MOVIE EVER.SPOILER ALERT* you do see two-face, and he is in the movie for a good half hour, and he looks damn awesome."
7684,True,"Mad CRAZY Blazing Brilliant!! Heath Ledger rips off the Cinema Screen with the sheer inherent insanity of his bizarre character which he has so well adopted. They dare say it's true, but I believe people who claim that he use to isolate himself in his apartment, literally fitting into the very clothes and rehearsing what very few people could possibly do, i.e. portraying the JOKER.Three scenes literally had my heart beating so fast in the movie, that I couldn't help but smirk at the beauty of those cut scenes.**SPOILERS** 1. The Bat Pod ejecting out of the Batmobile. GOD!! Spectacular!!!2. The JOKER getting beaten till he bleeds in the Interrogation room by the BATMAN and still laughing off.. He knows he'll win anyways.3. The JOKER trying to blow the GPD vehicle carrying Harvey Dent with the Bazooka.4. And finally, the best scene of the entire movie.. The Joker (again) blowing off the Gotham General Hospital to bits, playing with the remote in his bizarre nurse outfit!! **Goosebumps all over my body** INSANE!!!I salute you heath Ledger. If you win an Oscar, you truly, truly, deserve it.God Bless you for giving us such a memorable performance. We Love You. RIP"
7685,True,"Not only did this movie bring excitement throughout its entirety, but it also had stellar acting, a great plot, and beautiful character development. First off Heath's joker is something to be marveled at. He perfected the role and turned the joker into the psychotic, blood crazy villain that we all so desired. In addition, his role really darkened the tone of the movie, giving it an edge that most Batman movies (excluding Begins) have never really had. The jokers constant shifts in mood, ideals, and actions in the movie left me questioning his sanity throughout, which was definitely the intentions of Nolan. In fact, i rarely could even guess his next move and this made his character so perfectly frightening. Bale and Eckhart are also stunning in their roles as well. A battle torn and somewhat confused Bale was really portrayed after the Joker entered Batmans life and begins wrecking him physically and mentally. Eckhart was a beautiful Harvey Dent. The entire first half of the movie his light side was so apparent i really enjoyed his presence, and his transformation into two face was fantastic. The visual effects and action scenes were nothing short of perfect, never too animated and never by any means dull. From the start to the finish i was entertained in what i think was one of the best movies of the past 2 years. I plan on seeing it again in theaters and definitely buying it once it hits DVD sales. If there is ever a movie to go and spend 9 dollars on, id recommend this, and id recommend it to all ages."
7686,True,"The hype on this movie reached the level of any superhero movie, and i went to watch it with the same expectations, a b rated action packed movie that would be just as understandable for me as any 8 year old who's parents allowed to watch it.Yet after the first few scenes of the movie, i realized that this was more then the average superhero movie, it's beyond constant action, perfect timing, and snappy catchphrases. This movie had depth to it that i haven't seen in any superhero movie to this day, with many deep jabs at human psyche and our two faced nature. When most superhero criminals want money, and are afraid to be captured, Heath Ledgers portrayal of the Joker shows that he is beyond the shallow mind of the basic villain, he does not want the money, or the jewels, nor does he fear death, laughing as he fell to his demise before batman saves him. The deep impact of this movie really surprised me, even some of the more political jabs, which were harder to notice, really impressed me in this movie. The b rate superhero wants little more then fame and fear from criminals, but the Dark Knight shows that being a hero, doesn't mean you must be seen as the good guy."
7687,True,"I've had an evening to 'attempt' to put my thoughts in a semblance of 'order'. Don't pardon that pun, it is fully intended.The Dark Knight transcends the concept of a 'Super hero movie'. It stands alongside carbon deposits as an iron mountain. Without being bombastic, delivers an experience of such incredible magnitude that other titles claiming to be such are entirely translucent in comparison.Gotham City is no longer obvious sets and sound stages and blatant special effects and models in the midst of real time suburbia. Gotham City is living and breathing, from its skyscrapers to the liquor bottles in bars to the cops on patrol, of which there are many. It's not Tim Burton dark, but that's just fine. It's far more realistic, and as such far more believable, and therefore far more powerful when the stakes in the film become all too obvious.Batman is no longer a upcoming crusader, he is ready and confident in his ways, and feared by the criminal underworld. Indeed, such is his effect on the crime networks of the city that the big scary dog has withered to the scared and desperate puppy that thinks twice before barking.Then all of a sudden 'Enter the Clown Prince'. Heath Ledgers performance as the deranged criminal mastermind cannot easily be put into words. To call it 'acting' would somehow be selling it short. Ledger becomes an embodiment of a new age Joker. It would be wrong to make any comparison to Jack Nicholsons Joker, a sublime Batman Comic book realisation. Ledger takes it to a new level. His maniacal laugh and his calculating anarchic, psychotic disposition are not only a match for are Dark Crusader, they raise the bar of morals and integrity and strike deep chords within his being.When everything you have ever known and loved, and worked for is in jeopardy .. what do you have left to bargain with? What use is brute force and intimidation against a laughing antagonist who has field, and plays it with no limitations.Performances all around are strong, and I was surprised by Eckhard, of whom I was the most uncertain. Bale and Caine and Freeman and Oldman as always carry the weight of the film. With effective supporting performances by Maggie(Dawes) Gylenhall and Eric (Maroni) Roberts. The real star of the show, well, I don't really need to continue with that one, now do I? :)The Dark Knight is an IMAX experience. The smaller screens will still entertain, but for the real scope of this feature, IMAX is the real McCoy.Forget what you thought you knew, forget anything that has tried and fallen flat and hard. Go an experience The Dark Knight. Popcorn is nice, but taking your eyes off the screen is not recommended."
7688,True,"It was with great reluctance that I watch batman begins seeing as Nolan directs his movie in a clear attempt to out stage Tim Burton's version by portraits similar scenes to the ones that catch in the Burton movie like the ¨I'm batman¨scene; and like the introduction of the batmovil. The previous statements and comments on this recreation of batman to make it less like the previous version and more like the action comics; elevated much of fan expectations. Seeing as Nolan fails to focus the production on this goal the results showed on the box office as the movie produced shy of $50million less than the 16 year old remark.It is true to say that the attempt succeeds to restore batman's image after the horrifying spectacle Schumacher put us fans through with his sequels. It is with a refreshing attitude that i came out to see the latest of Nolan's batman seeing how he goes to the original idea of bringing the Dark Knight back to his essential basics. Not killing the villains, focusing on the antihero status that batman stands for, the whole creation an make up of the villains not diminishing there characters to improve the plot was great and commendable. Though the competition with the Burton version remain but fortunately it didn't break the movie's directed effect to the audience. I loved it and any other batman fan should think the same and hope for a third part. Shame the joker's interpreter died cause he did manage to convey the sicotic dark humor that was so much need to contrast batman.I really love the movie's structure and I will follow it for the time that the Francaise continues to serve me such a wonderful show."
7689,True,"Batman the Dark Knight was easily the best film of the year. Ledger did a phenomenal job with the role of the Joker and the movie was played out nicely. The fact that there were no bats in the movie really isn't relevant. I mean seriously, you don't go see the movie to see bats flying around.I think that Two Face was very well played and put together and I loved the ending. The fact that Batman took the fall for Harvey Dent so Gotham didn't know their ""White Knight"" had fallen, was brilliant. I really loved it and if Ledger doesn't get an award for the movie, I'l be completely surprised. I can't wait to go see it again and I definitely can't wait for the sequel."
7690,True,"Wow.Only having been out for 3 days, I have already seen it twice. It is that good.Now, to start off, I was not a big fan of ""Batman Begins"". I thought it was too drawn out, featured a sub-standard plot, and was more or less just another comic adaptation, albeit a tad bit more realistic. (On that note, I am not a big fan of comic book adaptations at all).Enter, ""The Dark Knight"", which is, I think it is safe to say, the best movie of 2008 and most likely the last 3 or 4 years. These are bold statements, true, but Christopher Nolan's masterpiece lives up to them (and indeed, the intense media hype that has surrounded the movie).Acting: Amazing. Christian Bale takes his acting a step up from his previous performance in ""Begins"". Gary Oldman's version of Lt. Gordon is an excellent supporting character, worthy of at least a nod from the Oscars. Aaron Eckhart, already one of my favorite actors, simply reaffirms himself as one of the most talented stars of our time. His take on Harvey Dent is much better than Tommy Lee Jones's. And thank God that Maggie Gyllenhaal replaced Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Now I know what you're thinking if you, for some odd reason, are the only person who hasn't seen the film yet; is Heath Ledger's ""Joker"" as good as it's supposed to be? The answer is noit's better. It's easily the best performance of his too-short career and will be remembered for generations. I would not be surprised if (and would, indeed, be disappointed if he doesn't) become the first person since Peter Finch to posthumously win a best actor Oscar.Script: Although not quite as impressive as the acting, it is still a fine piece of work. The Joker's lines are both horrifying as well as morbidly funny (take for instance, when he is dangling Rachel Dawes off the top of a building and Batman say's, very typically, ""Let her go!"". The Joker's response? ""Very poor choice of words, hahah!""). Bale is given some excellent material to work with and his interactions with Michael Cain provide some much needed comic relief to this otherwise gloomy tale. There are some truly gasp-worthy twists, and, although there is the occasional one-note character, they don't get a lot of screen time, so it's understandable that they lack depth. What makes ""The Dark Knight"" so much better than the average comic-book-adaption, or even the average action movie, is that it is, at it's core, neither of these. It is, first and foremost, a morality tale, told in a very realistic, very human way, and therein lies it's secret to avoiding most of these two genera's clichés; we haven't really seen a truly good morality tale at the theater in such a long time that we as the audience probably don't know any of the genera's clichés.Cinematography: Deserving of an Oscar nomination, at the very least. Another thing that separates this batman movie from it's earlier predecessors (especially the one's from the 90's) is that it's very realistic. It doesn't try to say ""HEY NONE OF THIS IS REAL!!!"". Quite to the contrary, this film is much more real than most dramas. The lighting here is very dark and gloomy and, thankfully, those awful color's from ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman & Robin"" are nowhere to be found. Directing: Solid and, arguably, Nolan's best. The only problem I have is that of pacing. Now, don't get me wrong; I like long movies. As a matter of fact, I prefer them to these short, 90-minute cookie-cutter one's that Hollywood so loves to produce. But your film shouldn't be 150 minutes simply for the sake of being 150 minutes. I am more than willing to forgive this trespass, though, because I simply did not want this film to end.Score: Excellent. There is not just one cheesy, heroic theme that you will hear repeating the whole movie (whose sounding you can be rest assured means that our hero is on the job) and, as such, you will not have to endure everyone in your office humming that theme for weeks. And it should be that way in a film like this. It would merely be a bad distraction. Most of the music is, in short, amazing, especially the contrasting two-note theme of the Joker and Harvey Dent's themes, which are typically made up of more brass. Although you probably won't be able to remember any once piece enough to hum it once you walk out of the theater, it is all still very distinctive and, chances are if you hear it again, you will instantly be able to place it.Miscellaneous: One of the things that blew me away about ""The Dark Knight"" was how realistic it came off as. Never before has Gotham ever seemed like it could be a real, breathing city. It comes off as a place like Chicago, but not necessarily as a Chicago stand-in. It is never over the top (as it frequently was in past Batman films) and always seems like a place that, if you so desired, could easily visit.Conclusion: And what do you get when you put all these great parts together? Nothing but a great film. Not just a movie, but a true work of cinema, possibly the first piece worthy of being called cinema to be produced in Hollywood in a couple of years. It's just amazing and awe-inspiring. I cannot stress enough how good it is. And it holds up just as well on a repeat viewing. I'm looking forward to seeing how well it holds up to a third-viewing.10/10"
7691,True,"I just came back from The Dark Knight and I walked out stunned, along with a theater PACKED with people. Everyone seemed happy. Two-face and the Joker's appearance were amazing. Two-face was in it long enough for me to be satisfied. The Joker had the best acting in the whole movie, making me chill every time he talked. Christian Bale's Batman voice made me think ""Awesome!"". Some scenes surprised me, especially when the Joker cut open the man's mouth and when Two-Face threatened to shoot Gordon's son. The best part in the entire movie though was every scene. So to make this a little shorter than it is... Best movie I've seen in a loooooooong time. I HIGHLY recommend it. 10 stars."
7692,True,"OK, I finally got my chance to see The Dark Knight and I'm very happy to say that it's the best of the series. But before I do my review of the best I'm going to do my review of the worst, Batman & Robin. No matter how good Uma Thurman looked has Poison Ivy there's no disputing the fact that not only did Joel Shumacher really butcher the directing but Akiva Goldsman made the worst script in his career; a complete 180 from his brilliant ""A Beautiful Mind"". George Cloony was the worst Bruce Wayne (yes he was worse than Adam West) Chris O'Donnell as Robin wasn't much better and Arnold Schwarzenegger became the worst villain of all time as Mr Freeze. I give it a 3/10 for the pure fact that it can be enjoyed if you really have no taste. Next worse is Batman Forever. Even if it had the most Oscar Nods of the series so far Tommy Lee Jones and Chris O'Donnell doomed the movie from get go. Although Val Kilmer wasn't bad as the caped crusader he just didn't fit the role like Michael Keaton did before him. Another problem was that Joel Shumacher replaced Tim Burton which pushed the comic book appeal way over the top. I've got to say that Nicole Kidman was really good in her role and that she did bring the film up a few notches, but the true star of the film was Jim Carrey. He was so funny and yet so insane in his role has Edward Nigma/the Riddler. I give this a 6.5/10 for not being a total flop.Now the series begins to get better with Batman Returns. Although Danny Devito wasn't great as the Penguin, Michelle Pfeiffer brought the real villain to the film. In this installment Michael Keaton and Tim Burton return to their respective roles has Batman and Director but they definitely lost the magic after they switched the villains. I give this a 7.5/10for not butchering the series.In 3rd Place the original Batman movie which was fantastic. Jack Nicholson was great has the comical Joker and if I were judging this on awesome cartoony flavor than this would be #1 but since I'm not I put it at 3rd. Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson play off each other so well and there's very little more to it. I give this a 8.5/10 for being the best original and the best Joker until TDK.In 2nd place Batman Begins reboots the series with a fresh new cast. Christian Bale completely renews the character of Bruce Wayne with a new sense of confusion and bringing a real anti-hero play into the role which is a great spin on the character. Michael Caine does a fantastic job as Alfred and completely blows Michael Gough out of the water. Bringing Morgan Freeman into the movie was a great idea all together. Liam Neeson was a refreshing change from the cartoony villains from the earlier movies and has a great heir of arrogance. The only bad part was Katie Holmes playing Rachel Dawes, she was just a bad choice for the part but luckily she was replaced for the latest installment. I give this a 9/10 for reviving the series. Finally in 1st place is The Dark Knight. The film is not only the greatest Batman/ Superhero film of all time it's also one of the best films of all time. Director Christopher Nolan brought back the realism he used in Batman Begins as well as the actor's. Christian Bale completes his turn to the anti-hero and is so real in the role, but the real star of the movie is the late Heath Ledger. The darkness he brings to the role rivals Hannibal Lecter as a villain. He is so evil and you just can't deny liking him no matter how much you hate him. His plans, or rather lack of plans makes everything very suspenseful. Another star of the film was Aaron Eckhart has Harvey Dent/ Two Face. He brings the knight in shining armour feel to the movie to contrast the anti-hero Batman which is nice until he snaps. I'm not going to give away how or why he snaps but when he does he plays a villain that reminds me Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars 3. He's good but just snaps. Next Maggie Gylenhall plays Rachel Dawes with a much more commanding and sincere character than Katie Holmes did. Gary Oldman is spectacular has Capt. and later Police Commissioner James Gordan. He never loses his trust in our caped crusader even when the world has turned against him. The final stars of the film are the mob boss Maroni who is a new kind of boss instead of the same Old Italian wacko. There is one thing you can't forget which the design for the latest two movies is. To be short and frank are amazing. The Batmobile is so much cooler now than it was and then the Batcycle is even cooler than the Batmobile. I give this a 10/10 for bringing the superhero movie into the category of Oscar worthy Drama.To end off I just want to say that I love all the movies (except Batman & Robin) and can say It's one of the greatest series in movie history."
7693,True,"One thing I realized after watching ""The Dark Knight"" was that, for the first time in my life, I do not want to be Batman. It is a horrible, horrible life. There is no peace, no rest, no happiness for Bruce Wayne. ""The Dark Knight"" crystallizes what it is like to be the Batman in a way never seen before on the printed page or on the silver screen. And I do not want to be Batman. I'd rather be any other superhero -- Superman, Green Lantern, or even the Flash.And another thing. Batman, especially Christopher Nolan's Batman, does not whine. He doesn't complain about how bad he has it. He is the antithesis of Spider-Man, particularly Sam Raimi's Spider-Man. Peter Parker seems to almost wallow in his misery, whereas Bruce Wayne gets up, dusts himself off, and launches himself at evil and injustice again and again.And I'll take the Dark Knight over Iron Man any day. Bruce Wayne plays the role of the vapid, moral-less playboy. Tony Stark is one. Bruce Wayne never compromised himself to do what's right. Tony Stark does this all the time, and even kills people. And lastly, Batman's identity is a secret...Stark basically unmasks himself for everyone to see. I'd rather have the Batman on my side at any time.Now, this is no normal review of ""The Dark Knight."" You can get that anywhere. I apologize for using this review as a sounding board, but after seeing the masterpiece that was ""The Dark Knight,"" I just had to share my feelings. And don't get me wrong, I loved ""Iron Man."" Loved it. But, Iron Man is no Dark Knight. There's only one and thank God he still lives on the silver screen."
7694,True,"There is no doubt that this is possibly the most anticipated movie of the 21st century, and one cannot help but ask if it actually lives up to the massive hype following it. This simple answer is yes, this movie not only lives up to the hype, but it blows the hype out of the water! This movie is not just a superhero movie, but it's a movie that can work as a lot of things. A character and dialogue driven movie for the most part, Christopher Nolan crafted a movie that an stand it's own as a crime classic, not only a Batman movie.The next question that everyone has is about Heath Ledger, and is he really as good as everyone is saying he is. Now to be honest, and this may offend some people, Heath Ledger has never really impressed me with his acting. In all his movies he just seemed like a pretty boy, and nothing really stood out. To me he looked like he was there to put chicks in the seats, and nothing more. When i first heard he was going to play The Joker i was worried. They were trusting what is possibly the greatest villain of all time to HIM! Needless to say i was not happy. But after seeing this movie i can see the talent that others have seen in Heath, and that he wasn't just a pretty boy. He played the Joker so well that if someone didn't know that Ledger was the Joker (which is impossible and this point anyways) they would never be able to tell it was him. When you play a character so well that you cant tell who the actor is, that's good acting. I would not be surprised if he gets the Oscar, and it's a shame that he died just after showing what talent he truly had. R.I.P. Heath Ledger.The only problem with this movie is that because Ledger was so good and died, his performance will overshadow some other truly amazing performances, Aaron Eckhart especially. He made Harvey Dent an amazing character, and made you feel for him during and after the transformation into Two-Face. Much better then that sad performance from Tommy Lee Jones. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes was much better then Katie Holmes was. Yes Katie Holmes was hotter, but Maggie Gyllenhaal gave an amazing performance. She added something to the character, and when she died, you really felt something. Michael Caine was great as usual, as he provides both comical and emotional scenes. Morgen Freeman, although his role was small, was still great as always, and Christian Bale continues to show why he should continue to be Batman/Wayne. Last but not least, Gary Oldman's Lt. James Gordon is, to me anyways, the most interesting character. Oldman is an amazingly versatile actor, and I'm always interested to see what he'll do next.The music, done by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard is amazing, and sets the tone for every scene. An epic and thrilling score that really ups the adrenaline during the action scenes, which are amazing in there own. No over the top CGI or anything like that, what your seeing during those action sequences is all real. The only visible CGI that i could notice was parts of Two-Face's second face. I know most of it was make up, but you could tell that parts we're added in post production.None of this would have been possible without Christopher Nolan. Him and his brother really really captured the essence of Batman in the script, and provided the depth and darkness that a Batman movie really needs.Overall this movie is a masterpiece. I'm not going to rate it, just leave it at that. It's a masterpiece. Kevin Smith wasn't lying when he said that ""The Dark Knight is the Godfather II of superhero movies."""
7695,True,"I had expected much from this movie, and I didn't disappointed at all. The cinematography is as good as in Batman Begins. The action scenes, well, there are not many of them in the show, but, as quality over quantity, every scene was spectacular enough to please the audience and make their hearts skip some beats. I was most impressed with the main cast's performance. Firstly, let's talk about Heath Ledger (may he rest in peace). This is the best performance from him I've ever seen. The Joker is portrayed perfectly by Ledger. His menacing laugh, his cunning personality, his destructive tendencies were very disturbing in the movie, and the audience can realize that he commit crime just for fun, and how dangerous he is. Heath Ledger have made me felt very uneasy until the end. This Joker is like an ultimate test for everyone's resolve about good and evil. However, we should not forget about Christian Bale and Aaron Eckhart. Bale have made the audience see that this Batman is the same as the one in Batman Begins, a hero who resides in the dark, who always have conflicts inside him about doing the right thing. Batman may be the most ""human-like"" superhero I have ever known, and Bale has done his best to bring out this image of the Dark Knight. Eckhart also did a good job in playing ""a good guy gone wrong"", who have plummeted into rage and insanity. This is a movie that will make you think a lot about true justice, and the line between good and evil. You have to take note of nearly the entire lines of the main cast, because those lines not just keep the story going, but also convey the messages of the movie."
7696,True,"Frankly speaking I was not interested in Batman movies but after seeing Batman Begins I thougth i should give this movie a look.I went to The Dark Knigth with Humoungous expectations and can easily say I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The Joker Played by Heath Ledger will go as the best comic book or probably the best villain in the history of Movies.May Ledger's soul rest in peace.In a place where i belong where English movies are alien I've never seen crowds getting entertained like this before here are few scenes where the crowds roared and cheered.....(Spoilers ahead) *The Jokers entry and pencil vanishing act. *The introduction of new bat suit and other gadgets. *The HongKong episode. *The Pre interval Chase scene was cheered like never before. *Scene where joker claps in the Jail and his act as the nurse and the blasts that follow. *The climax figth and the JOker Physcotic plan of blowing up the ships. (Thanks to the background score it was a tensed sequence). So summing it up with Memorable performances,Superb sequences,Brilliant Background score,Amazing cinematography The Dark Knigth will go down as one of the best movies in the history of films..."
7697,True,"OK so I know this movie just came out like 2 days ago but come on all you nerds are thinking about what comes next. Joker is obviously out of the question. No point disgracing Heath because no one can step into the clown size shoes he's created. What a performance, what interpretation of the greatest villain ever. I don't see Riddler or Freeze working well in a third movie. Catwoman also would be cheesy, one thing this NEW franchise has not been. Nolan knows this, he's very smart, so I only see one way to do a third movie. I actually wanted this story for a third movie after I saw ""Begins."" In a name, Raz al Ghoul. Any one who knows the comics knows that Raz is immortal via the pits in the Middle East. In fact there is a story where Batman dies and is brought back by the pits. So I would say bring back Batman's mentor/father figure for the final villain. Red Claw could be introduced and the setting wouldn't even be Gotham. This would avoid having to deal with Joker in Arkham Asylum. What makes this so sad is that I am seeing this as a movie instead of just being grateful that Ledger put so much hard work into Dark Knight. Without him though I don't see any way of making a third movie without introducing the middle east and pits. Two Face could even come back (although the two things I didn't like in Dark Knight were Aaron Eckhart and Maggie G) but without Raz we are left with a live Joker and passed away Ledger and a Dead Two Face with a live Eckhart. Nolan is so legitimate I know he'll make a strong choice. I hope he makes another one but I don't see it being any good without Liam Neeson being brought back."
7698,True,"And I have seen The Silence of the Lambs. You probably will hear this a lot, but Heath Ledger's performance really does match the hype. His performance will go down with the likes of Anthony Hopkins as one of the greatest villains. One could not ask for a better match than Michael Caine as Alfred. Though not fantastic, Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance was very good. Aaron Eckhart is a very believable Harvey Dent, as you really believe that he wants what's good for the city. None of the supporting actors had any bad performances, and Heath Ledger really matches the anguish and confusion that we expect to see from Batman. The music was thrilling, and the visuals were even more so. Action, Drama, some Romance, and even really funny Humor combine with Christopher Nolan's direction to make not only the best film of 2008, but one of the best films in years, which is destined to become the standard to which all future superhero films are compared in the future."
7699,True,"All that I can say is wow. This just might be the best film I've ever seen. I saw it on the day it came out and when I checked on this web site the next day it was already a 9.6 which is needless to say very rare. Who do we have to thank for that? Health Ledger of course. The whole time he was in the film he all ways had that swagger that smooth beautiful motion acting as a lunatic comic book character brought into the flesh. He disappears into the character so good that honestly this is the first time that I've ever been in a movie theater where audience members to the right and to the left of me were like ""he's crazy"". They said it more than once too. Usually when I go to the theaters I can't even relate to the characters and situations much less write reviews about them.If your going to do a remake of something that has already been done many times over such as something of the comic book genre it's important to remember a very crucial formula. The comic book is the Bible, the cartoon is the mythology, but the movie is how it actually would have happened. Christopher Nolan understood this concept perfectly. Throughout the film you get the feeling that this is a series of spectacular events dropped in an ordinary world. There's no weird filming technique that distorts color, there's not any obsession on trying to make everything look shiny like there was in Daredevil, and there's no Matrix rip offs (bullet time, dudes doing suspiciously impossible jumps in slow motion). Nolan keeps it real. Are there alterations to the original story? There probably are, the last I heard joker got his scars after Batman knocked him into a tank of acid and that he was the one who really shot Bruce Waynes parents (they created each other). This is not the only story alterations. In the comics Ras Al Gould (if I misspelled that don't trip) was an immortal who found a way to keep young. In Batman Begins it's hinted that a Ras Al Gould immortal is just a titled given to boss ranking members of the League of Shadows the same way that emperor's of Rome accepted the titled ""Caesar"". Little twists like that might upset comic and cartoon fans, but what they must understand is that when your making a movie adaptation it helps if you include a bit of *realism*.Most of the time though the biggest reason people don't like works such as this isn't because people know too much of the mythology and the original story but because they know too little. Allow me to explain, (by the way I'm about to get into some spoilers so if you haven't seen this movie yet then please don't get upset if you lose a sense of drama after reading this) there is a part in this movie when it appears that Gordon has been shot and killed, now me being a fan of the cartoon knows that Gordon has always been a prolific instrumental character, in other words a *main* character, and adaptation film makers usually aren't that stupid to kill off key characters so quickly, and as it turns out they weren't Gordon comes back after playing possum just in time to rescue Batman now when they showed his face the audience was confused... no really they were. One said ""What?! I thought he died."" and some were snickering cause they perceived this as the film makers just doing what ever they could to bring back a character, but me knowing what was going on all I did was smile and nod in approval. Also after it was over I over heard some douche bag saying it was boring. The joker was blowing up everything in sight, shooting people here and there, backstabbing his allies with ease and this man was going to call it boring? What kind of movies does this guy watch? (People in my home town of Salinas aren't exactly known for there brains... never move here... seriously.) What I think confused those people was Batman's overly righteous persona ex. refusal to kill, willingness to take blame, the dialog revolving around concepts of hope, and heroes, and doing good in face of danger. These people are just not familiar with what Batman represents. He's a symbol, he's a symbol of being righteous fighting powerful evil obstacles with his bare hands and coming away the winner. Sometimes it seems that no matter how good a movie is there's always going to be haters out there."
7700,True,"Remember how all that political talk about the Senate and the Republic in Star Wars: Episodes I, II & III really dragged down that series, and added nothing? Well, in The Dark Knight there is a similar amount of esoteric, difficult-to-follow dialogue - only in this case, it is about social responsibility, tenuous morality and the dangers of vigilantism. But this time, it is a central theme of the movie and - by design - it practically overshadows the characters themselves. Oh yeah, one other difference - this time it works. In fact, in The Dark Knight you really have to keep your thinking cap on - it will warrant a second viewing just so you can absorb all the deep ideas and difficult decisions it throws at you.The film opens with a very original bank robbery. Think how many times you've seen a bank robbery in movies. You've never seen one like this. Then we find the situation complicated by wanna-be Batmen. The action grows from there as Batman goes international. That's about all the detail I'm gonna give. There are some really amazing action sequences in this movie and more than a few surprises. I've checked the Spoiler box but don't really want to put any in the review - this is a movie that is best viewed ""fresh"". To the marketers' credit, this is one film that doesn't seem to have been ruined or spoiled by its trailers. It's true that The Dark Knight feels more like a crime epic than a superhero movie - but it's the better film for it.Heath Ledger's performance is very memorable, and certainly worthy of at least an Oscar nomination. While there may be the most minor traces of Jack Nicholson's portrayal, Heath goes in a different direction and really makes the Joker his own, and it's easy to see how the character affected his sleep patterns. Heath's Joker may be laughing, but he's definitely not joking. The movie is not perfect - it drags a bit in the second half. But at least you won't have to check your watch to know when the second half starts: the turning point of this movie elicits visceral emotion and that's a sign of great movie-making.And there are some parts that are highly implausible, even for a superhero epic, but they have more to do with the behavior of everyday citizens than with larger-than-life heroes and villains.Probably the hardest conceit to accept is the idea that Batman would prefer an ordinary citizen to do his job. It's almost as if his motto is ""With great power, comes great responsibility - for somebody else"". But again, nothing in this film is black and white - all of the heavy themes are presented from multiple perspectives and nobody, not even the filmmakers, claim to have easy answers.Oh yeah, there are certain scenes where Batman's voice is very strange, almost as if he's shouting with laryngitis. It seems apparent that he is trying to disguise his voice in front of those most likely to recognize Bruce Wayne's. Realistic? Maybe. Annoying? Definitely. Fortunately, ""rasp voice"" comes and goes.When all is said and done, there are just too many original scenes, memorable characterizations, deep ideas, and big action sequences in this movie to dismiss it. Let the haters hate, let the fanboys rate it an 11, no matter. I and others in my theater found ourselves cheering spontaneously more than once without embarrassment. It is the ultimate irony that the Joker's catchphrase is ""Why So Serious?"" This movie takes some big ideas very seriously, something very few mass-marketed films of any genre have done in a long time. By doing so, the filmmakers have achieved a milestone in storytelling: they made the superhero movie not just entertaining, but important.Rest in Peace, Heath Ledger. Your final work will not be soon forgotten."
7701,True,"This movie has a lot in common with Batman Returns. Yet ironically enough its better than that one. Michael Keaton played Batman twice before ditching the role. Batman returns being his second and ultimately final go at it.Like Batman Returns this of course is Christian Bale's second go as Bruce Wayne/Batman. This also is the second Batman sequel to feature the bat-glider variant of Batman's costume with the same actor from the prior Batman namely Christian Bale in the same role.The main villain in Batman Returns was the penguin and he had a messed up childhood he attributed to his overall criminal development. Likewise the Joker in The Dark Knight attributes his messed up childhood to his criminal development going so far as to share how he got his first ""smile"".Yet for all these similarities betwixt Batman Returns and The Dark Knight? Everything it uses it does better and expands upon it in someways. The glider costume for instance isn't a one trick pony Bruce Wayne uses once. He uses it multiple times throughout the movie once as an attack tactic at a crucial moment near the end. It still remains to be seen as to whether Christian Bale will be willing to done the cape for a third go around. Also I can't help but wonder who if anyone will take Lucius Fox's place perhaps that guy Reese?"
7702,True,"It was a weird movie-going experience. I came in not knowing really what to expect and yet I left feeling like I got much more than I bargained for. I've been a avid reader of Batman comics, and yet I don't recall the Joker ever creating chaos on this level. It's a HUGE package of darkness, ambiguity, and complexity. You won't believe the ethical choices Batman makes this time around, and the rift created among the 'comrades' Batman, Gordon, and Dent. You won't feel hunger for action, drama, or suspense. This movie has it all!! And yes, Ledger unquestionably deserves an Oscar nod, and not just to help him rest in peace."
7703,True,"In the 2000's we have seen so many amazing films including Gladiator. The Lord Of The Rimgs Trilogy, Million Dollar Baby, Crash, Batman Begins & even Iron-Man. All those films were fantastic but The Dark Knight was even better. I Loved The Dark Knight because it was the perfect movie & the perfect sequel everybody hoped for. The Plot was excellent, the cast was fabulous, the special effects were good, & the action was awesome. Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was legendary. He deserves the Oscar for best supporting actor. Jack Nicholson is one of the greatest actors of all time and he was great as the Joker in Batman (1989) but this Joker was better than Jack's Joker. One Scene that would probably give Heath Ledger the Oscar is when he meets up with the mob & shows them a magic trick. He was scary and funny as the true DC Comic Joker. Christopher Nolan can finally be named a great director because look at the movies he's made Memento, Insomina, Batman Begins, The Prestige, and this classic The Dark Knight. The way he crafted this movie with the perfect shots was incredible. Christian Bale is the perfect Batman, he was really good as Bruce Wayne but even better as his alter ego Batman. Aaron Eckhart was awesome as Harvey Dent/Two-Fac , this was his breakthrough performance for him & did an excellent job. Gary Oldman was great Lt. James Gordon.Morgan Freeman & Michael Caine two great actors did great as Fox & Alfred. I was very disappointed when Katie Holmes wasn't going to reprise her role as Rachel Dawes, so Maggie Gylenhaal had a lot to live up to & she was perfect. The action scenes were great, one scene with Batman & Chinese mobster Lau was awesome & the best scene of the movie was The Batman & Joker chase scene. It was perfect that one scene. This movie is intense, dark, exciting, & will keep on the edge of your seat. I recommend that this classic for a best picture nomination, Go see this movie! R.I.P Heath Ledger 1979-2008"
7704,True,"This was a movie that transcended your typical action movie. The subtle themes and moral debates presented in this film were totally unexpected. The moral (or spiritual, if you will) conflict between the Joker and Batman reminded me of Dennis Lehane's ""Darkness, Take my Hand."" This story could have been told without superheroes and villains to spice it up. (not that I would want that). The line that struck me that people should consider when watching the Joker's character develop occurred briefly at the beginning of the scene where he meets the criminal bosses. This was the only line that the Joker was completely serious about, (all of his other scenes he is enjoying himself). He says, ""I am NOT crazy."" This is meant to tell the audience that we are witnessing something much more than a deranged killer but a genius terrorist that wants simply to expose society for all of its weaknesses. He ranks up there with the best bad guys of all time. He believes in his mission, and he exposes Batman for all of his character flaws, which in turn gives credibility to the fact that Batman is not a ""good guy."" What an amazing movie not for it action packed scenes or it's character development, which were phenomenal, but for the themes and issues the writers tested and debated before our eyes. Did anybody else question the use of the Patriot Act being implemented to seek out the terrorist in this situation? It leads to interesting debates. I'm going to continue nursing this hangover, I may not have been clear in my review but my head hurts."
7705,True,"I was so thoroughly impressed by this movie in every way humanly possible. I never liked the Batman movies growing up, especially after the first movie with Michael Keaton. Batman Begins grabbed my attention much because of my love for Christian Bale's acting. Together, Bale and Nolan have resurrected a dead franchise.I am surprised this movie earned a PG-13 rating. This movie was so dark and tragic, I would've guessed R-rating. I have no quarrels with the movie's darkness and am even more impressed this movie WASN'T designed with children in mind.This movie will take you for a ride on an emotional roller coaster. After Rachel's death, I nearly cried for Harvey and his sadness. It was overwhelming. As for the next movie, I would've liked to see Nolan save two-face for the finale. He entered two-face in this movie to give the sorrow and sadness factor. I can't think of any villain who could be better than two-face and especially Joker were in this movie. Heath...you deserve an Oscar hands down."
7706,True,"Warning!! ( Many spoilers)First Tim Burton directed two films opening the legacy. Next, Joel Schumacher continued two more films, but for lesser quality. Now Chris Nolan has made ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight,"" something to treasure forever.There are three things that won me over with this movie. First, this film pushes the envelope to a near R-Rating. There so much gunfire, explosions, and gruesome images that I felt tensed of what would happen next. I love movies that take risks because if more movies exercised play-safe techniques, we would be watching ""Batman and Robin"" all over again. Second is Heath Ledger's brilliant performance. Although less comical, ledger's character is realistic, menacing, and truly horrifying. A true psychopath, which Ledger brings so much realism. Even if there is no posthumous Oscar nomination, Ledger will most definitely live on as a movie legend. Not a single online hater complaining about the film's length, darkness, or complex story can take away Ledger's status. Finally the third thing is the film has first-rate storytelling. There is a surprise twist and a nail-biting action sequence at every corner. The action is also evenly balanced with the plot and characterization. Its more than just a good v.s. evil film. There is real conflict and real turmoil that plays on both sides of law enforcers and law violators. The film concerns Batman/Bruce Wayne trying to make the city a better place. while crooks and copycat vigilantes run amok, the Joker associates himself with powerful crime bosses. Through countless terrorist attacks, the Joker commands the citizens of Gotham to do whatever he wants as long as he controls their fears and emotions. Sometimes there is no clear motive or explanation about the Joker's past, but he wants to unmask Batman and try to make him appear villainous in the face of Gotham. The Joker is anything but a two-dimensional villain. He had a conflicted childhood just like Bruce, but he uses his angst, his rage, and his emotions to hurt others rather than protect them. Bruce Wayne on the other hand soon wants to hang up his Batman suit and settle with his love Rachel Dawes, since DA Harvey Dent is leading a revolution against all citywide crime. That is until later, when Harvey Dent makes a transformation into the monstrous Two-Face. Who is just as scary and sinister as the Joker. From that moment onward its a crazy roller coaster ride of thrills, unpredictability, and tragedy.Although the movie is long, there is sharp editing, outstanding performances, great stunt work, a superb script, and enough memorable moments to make the 2.5 hours zip by. A MOVIE MASTERPIECE."
7707,True,"If you are a great fan of this comic book saga, you might be thinking ""Ey, is this movie the way to eternal Happiness?"".Well, yes, it is.Not only because the magnificent acting. Not only because the incredible, violent scenes... the sick, dark humor or the great direction of Nolan. This is a movie you cannot miss because it's a masterpiece, and all actors/actresses put their very essence, their very soul in this work.And that's the reason why this movie IS the movie.Period."
7708,True,"In my opinion, ""The Dark Knight"" is probably the greatest movie that I've ever seen based on a comic book. Starting from a creative direction by Christopher Nolan, this film never loses its strength due to the strong performances from a group of exceptionally gifted actors of their time. Action sequences are well-shot (especially the beginning with the bank robbery scene), storyline is beautifully constructed, and dialogs are memorable.Let's step aside and take a look at the late Heath Ledger's performance. I was stunned by the time when the film was over; I felt that this role was destined for him to play. Prior to the viewing of this performance, I had this notion of seeing Ledger as a 'mediocre' actor with no training trying to seek stardom for himself. However, this performance as the Joker changed my whole perspective of him; it filled me with tremendous respect for him as a dedicated and talented actor of his generation. He lives and breathes like the Joker; his performance makes Jack Nicholson's performance seem so lame. He is totally unpredictable. His anarchic style of interpretation keeps the audience in suspense - whenever he is on screen, no one knows what he's going to do next. Ledger possesses this Brando-esquire unpredictability within him that makes his performance so interesting to watch. My favorite scene was the interrogation scene between the Joker and Batman. As Batman pounds on the Joker more and more, Joker's smile grows bigger; Ledger displays the danger and the violence that lies underneath the sinister character. Just watching Ledger's performance makes everything worthwhile. It will be inspiring to many of the aspiring actors out there (like me) and I wish he wins a posthumous Oscar for this role.Other performances were outstanding - Christian Bale, Maggie Gyllenhall, Morgan Freeman, Eric Roberts, Michael Caine, etc. Aaron Eckhart gives a tour-de-force performance as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, capturing the dynamic layers of emotions that the character is going through. However, Gary Oldman's performance in this film was one of the reason why I loved this film so much. Continuing from his touching performance in Batman Begins, Oldman uses his chance to convey the emotions and the development of the character through his subtle performance. Especially the scene with Harvey Dent near the end of the film, Oldman just lets everything out and just touches the hearts of every moviegoers out there. If Oldman receives an Oscar nomination for this, I wouldn't be surprised; because he truly deserves it. Period.Action scenes are very gripping to watch. Nolan takes you on this exciting and dangerous journey of following the intense cat-and-mouse game between Batman and the Joker. Bank robbery scene and the Dent abduction scene are fascinating to watch and it never lets your energy level down. Combining all the elements of the film (explained above), this film doesn't even feel like 2 1/2 hour film; just flow with the movie and you won't even know the time is passing by like a wind.I give this movie 9 out of 10 stars because I wasn't fully satisfied or extremely impressed with the film. Maybe it was because I went in with such a HIGH expectation due to the hype of the film. But, no matter what it is, this film will stand to be one of the finest movies to be made and I hope it will garner some Oscar nominations. Better yet, few Oscars.R.I.P. Heath Ledger (1979~2008)"
7709,True,"Christopher Nolan is the master storyteller of the new millennium. I haven't seen any film of his that I could not give a perfect rating to and The Dark Knight is no exception. Any bias toward comic book characters aside this is a masterpiece of epic proportions. I recommend that those who hate comic books give it a see because The Dark Knight feels as authentic in human emotion as any drama could ever be.The anticipation for this film begins and ends with Heath Ledger as the Joker and I must say it is an electrifying performance. If Ledger gets a nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards it won't be out of pity, his Joker will easily be remembered as one of the most scary villain in motion picture history. There is no limit to what this monster of a character is capable of and the audience on the edge of their seat every time he is on screen because we know he will push the bar a little farther. I consider myself to be well read in the Batman universe and I knew that they were basing a lot of the character here off of the iconic Killing Joke and even I was left unprepared and aghast by what Ledger does. The Dark Knight is not for kids, hell even some smart adults will have to drop their jaws at what this Joker does. He is frightening, genuinely frightening. Praise most be given to Nolan as well because he is careful not to use too much of this Joker by over exploiting him with excessive screen time, he gets the same amount of screen time as a lot of the ensemble cast but it is worth it. All too often are good villain killed by too much screen time and every time the Joker is on screen he is as fresh and scary as he was before. This Joker really is a great collaboration between the outstanding script and an actor who does everything exactly right with it.Ledger isn't the only great performance though. Every actor takes this material extremely seriously and there isn't a bad performance in this movie. In fact there are some career performances in here besides for Ledger's, Aaron Eckhardt is outstanding as the tragic Harvey Dent. I was somewhat hesitant to the casting of Eckhardt, he hasn't really impressed me in anything before but I couldn't imagine anyone doing more with this character. The CGI used to create the Two Face character is somewhat fake looking but Eckhardt doesn't skip a beat when a lesser performance would be overshadowed by Two-Face's visuals. Gary Oldman is given more to do as Jim Gordon and this performance isn't just a notch in the belt for Oldman. He makes Gordon one of his most well rounded characters and one who is as tested by the Joker's anarchy as Batman and Dent.The script brings Batman to brave new places. Bale is terrific in the lead role but the lead role is different than it was before. We have never seen Batman as dark in his characterization than he is in this film. Batman is pushed past his limits and he becomes darker in his methods and along the way he loses the people he cares about. By the end of the film he is paranoid and uses his friend Lucius Fox's technology to spy on the people of Gotham to find the Joker's location. If The Dark Knight has a central theme it is that of justice and Bruce Wayne comes to realize that he will be alone in his quest for justice. The Joker tries to make his opponents more like him and he succeeds in turning Dent into the monster Two-Face but he also tests Batman. He questions Batman about his one rule in his exploits and we know that if Batman kills the Joker he will become him. The Joker delivers the classic lines stating that the two complete each other and that they will end up carrying out their war both not breaking who they are.CGI and the visuals often plague films like this and Nolan tries his hardest to make you believe that this could happen in our world and for that I most praise him. The Dark Knight is a story drenched in humanity and because of this Batman is the greatest superhero we have ever seen. Sure you could get bitten by a spider or build an Iron suit but that doesn't make you human. Batman is human and goes through hell in his crusade and for that he is the greatest superhero."
7710,True,"This movie brings open so much more storyline than Batman Begins, and Begins being such a good movie just sets this movie up for an amazing experience. The acting was perfectly paralleled with the constant storyline rolling along with complexity in simultaneous scenes occurring. I just love it! The acting takes a more emotional level and seriousness in this movie and Heath Ledger, I applaud for such a perfect job on the role of ""the joker."" He is beyond, and by far, the best joker I have ever witnessed. The action was also perfectly performed along with the effects that were intertwined. All in all, I say ""Welcome to the dark, for here is the Knight!"""
7711,True,"""He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee."" Friedrich Nietzche.Perhaps it was the midnight opening's fault. I was very tired. I knew something spectacular, awe-inspiring, and vast was passing in front of my eyes, but it was all so very fast. It was like passing a beautiful landscape in a minute. A two-and-a-half-hour-long minute. I felt aggravated that Christopher Nolan had not given his public more time for the (no doubt) wonderful movie to sink in. I felt genuinely angry.Dare I say disappointed? But this morning, getting up for work, the wretched movie would not get off my mind. Everything came back in pieces, Gordon's teary-eyed pleas, Lucius' righteous resignation, Alfred's military past, Rachel's goodbye, Dent's near-unshatterable idealism and the Joker's manic genius, twitchy words, his unbelievable coherence and the fact I found I could quote almost everything he had said, notwithstanding the fact that it was impossible to understand the first time through. And Batman was everything. He was the glue attempting to hold a crumbling world together.And suddenly another annoyingly memorable Nolan film came to mind: Memento. I thought the movie to be completely unbearable at first. Now, after over 20 views, I daresay it is my absolute favourite.The Dark Knight is of the same substance: a torturing, hard-to-digest plot, which serves to distracts you from Nolan's point. The plot is amazing, but focus on it too hard, and you will miss the golden thread beneath the surface, the soul of his story: the strife within his characters, the strife within society, within existence. The anguish of believing in the ultimate goodness of man in a city as rotten as Gotham, goodness taught through an example killed in an alley so long ago, anchors the very motivation of Batman, the source of all his strength and his greatest weakness. The faith in a condemned humankind as opposed to himself alone, is the Batman's ultimate paradox. A paradox that is clenched, twisted, and crushed by the prodigious Joker, gradually destroying all that Bruce Wayne cares for in the world, leaving him with nothing but his pain, his solitude, and his excruciating hope.The Joker, devastatingly, makes more sense and coherence than all of Gotham's desperate society and leaders put together. With every brush of genius he paints the gruesome portrait that shows the world: ""Your system is broken. Your rules are farce. Nothing can come from your mediocre selfishness, your inescapably flawed human nature."" It seems strange, but someone said that before. It was Bruce, the day he set out to achieve the vengeance that would have quelled the storm inside him. The day the Batman might have never been."
7712,True,"The Dark Knight lives up to it's hype, and then surpasses it. The depth of the acting, the levels of psychosis and differing views of morality you have to try and wrap your mind around, and the action sequences leave you sitting in the theater wondering if the state of shock your brain is in will stop soon. ***Spoiler*** I believe my personal state of shock moment started at the scene between Rachel Dawes and Harvey Dent when they are both tied up in different warehouses. The emotion in Gyllenhaal is incredible, the moment she realizes that she is going to die is on her face, and it just makes you ache. This is also the scene where the movie steps over the line, Dawes' death is horrifying, not because of the way it happens, but because the movie makes you think that she is going to be just fine, then it smashes your head into a wall and brings you into stark reality. ***Spoiler*** The shock doesn't wear off though, it keeps on going right along with you. After the death of Dawes you question everything, the people on the boats, the Dark Knight himself, Two-Face's destructive insanity, Commissioner Gordon just letting Batman take the fall for Dent. ""Is it all really going to end that way?"", I asked myself. Only to realize that the credits were on the screen and it was time to leave. I don't think my brain has caught up to answer ""yes"" yet. See the movie, feel your own awe at the story line and Ledger's last and greatest performance, and hope that your brain wakes up before the cinema workers have to kick you out."
7713,True,"I had the luxury of seeing Dark Knight when it first hit theaters this week and let me tell you, I was quite disappointed.I do not understand what the rave reviews are about but I found the plot line very complicated and confusing most times. Jumping from here to there, pushing far too much for a nearly 3 hour movie. Heath Ledger is an excellent actor of course but I found Nolan's version of Joker very demented and nothing like the comic book Joker or cartoons. He seemed like a mental patient then the Joker I grew up reading. Where were the jokes and the twisted sense of humor? The only thing they left was the menacing laugh which Ledger did fantastically.While I love watching Superheros, there just wasn't enough Batman. The whole movie focused a lot on the Harvey Dent character, who in my opinion should have been left for the third installment. It was already enough to have Joker as the villain, but Two-Face too? The development of Two-Face was quick as it ended. And his agenda was too poor to be believable as to why he was the classic Two-Face Batman fans know of.Batman himself was ho-hum. Christian Bale is good as Bruce Wayne, but as batman? No. That voice he puts on which supposedly was to be menacing came up more constipated and very forced. You could barely hear his dialog along with his spit fly out of his mouth occasionally. However, I did enjoy his fighting, which was downright how I see Batman fight the big baddies. But the main thing that bothered me most on whole that was missing was the Batmobile. I have no idea what Nolan was thinking to not include it in the movie. It was the main reasons I wanted to see it in the first place. Not to mention his classic domain, the Batcave, which was replaced with an underground high-tech warehouse. Not impressive.Overall, the movie was just too long, too complicated and forgettable. I favor Tim Burton's Batman over Nolan's version by a long shot. But then, everyone has their own opinion.4/10."
7714,True,"First of all I want to this movie has its good points. The Opening scene starts off very strong. But then this ends up being one of the most impact-full scenes featuring the joker. Throughout this movie I was waiting for that scene. A great dialogue scene between The Joker and Gordon. Or even one between Batman and Two-Face. But Most of the bad-guys didn't have enough dialogue to make them more than a 2-d thug.I was also waiting for the film to build into a climax. Kind of like the first but it never happened. Both of the face off-s that batman had with both bad guys went no where. I kept drawing back to the Tim Burton movie, or as far as two face the cartoon, and remembering the great jobs they did with them. At the end of the original batman of course Jack Nicholson isn't going to put up a fight with batman. But his henchmen gave him problems, and when they didn't he would threaten batman's girl with acid. The end of this movie fizzles. They took a great premise with the ferry's, and at the expense of trying to make the movie realistic they made it very un-suspenseful.Two other things that bugged me throughout were that editing and shooting around the action scenes. I never would get a sense of the whole scene or what was going on. The editing was really fast and from close shot to close shot. No long shots what so ever so we couldn't get a true sense of where the character where in relation to one another - AKA the underground car chase scene. Also Christian Bale's voice in the bat suit bugged me. But these are minor things compared to anti-climactic ending of the movie.In conclusion this movie started big but didn't live up to the hype. And when I say the word HYPE I'm not referring to Heath Ledger. I'm referring to HYPE about the JOKER! One of the best bad guys ever created. It just seemed like they were caught between being scary and funny with the Joker which is a good place to be. But in that struggle I never felt scared for a second. Where as in past Batman stories I was truly scared that his schemes would work."
7715,True,"Advance said it was darker than ""Begins"". I'd say bleak was more the tone. Certainly the Joker was much more psychotic than Nicholsons', which was the clearly the intent of the producers, so I guess if you see that as reality, it works; this is a comic book, so how real can it be? But the psychological monologues by Ledger got to be rather tedious. Not that he didn't deliver them well, sort of a modern day Hamlet musings, but without the clever word play. But after one or two, we got the point, he was a murderous psycho, I don't think we needed it drummed into us. Compared to Hopkins Lecter, or Perkins Psycho it was pale. If Ledger had not unfortunately died, I don't think you'd have had the adulation that's been bestowed on his performance.And Dent this ""white knight"", this hero that Gotham so desperately needs, suddenly becomes a psychopathic murderer because the Joker spends 5 minutes with him and one of his psycho monologues; a bit hard to swallow. And rather than take the memory of this beacon of hope from Gotham, Batman takes the rap for Dents killings. Please, why? Easily explained by his own terrible lose, why would that shatter Gothams hopes? And Dents Two-Face was like a T1 in flesh. Amazing how muscles can still work with no blood supply.But the real killer for me was the explosives on the ferries. After the Joker threatens to bomb the bridges/tunnels out of Gotham, no one on the police force thinks to check the ferries for bombs? A blind man would have noticed the dozens of 55 gallon drums of fuel oil and fertilizer aboard each ferry. To get all these on board, the Joker would have had to have an army of helpers and no one noticed? This was as dumb a storyline as you'd find in an Ed Wood film.On the plus side the action was good. Fight scenes were hard to follow as it seem like they mounted the camera on an actors arm, but the special effects were good."
7716,True,"The Dark Knight: A different 'plot' of view (Warning: Spoilers!) Movies are men made, there will always be errors and imperfections The Dark Knight is no exception. Its production quality was great, well directed and well acted but its plot was far from flaw less. I will not go as far as claiming it as a great movie without connecting that super hero context it was based up on.The biggest problem for Dark Knight's story originated from its realistic theme. Since unlike other Heroes, the caped knight has no super power. Equally, his enemies should have no super power either. Yet this Joker character in the Dark Knight has power beyond any super hero or villain: Power to defy logic! The new Batman series was praised for creating a world that is not like the one in the comics, it tries to be as real as possible. In short, it takes itself seriously as a normal movie! Therefore, I expect the plot to be logical and can pass the test of common sense.While the first half of the movie was excellent, though there was already a dent that foreshadows the problem that was to come: When the Joker crash the Wayne's party.This is the first time we saw Joker's super power at work. He walked in to the party from the gate. How would a few thugs with a leader that has face paint not be stopped at ground level of the building armed security guards that normally assign to guard a party attended by so many important people of the city? How would Master Bruce not be warned by his men beforehand when they are at the lobby? An army of private security would be storming in from every exit long before the Bat shows up! The joker and his men would never get away as cops would seal the building before a dramatic scene involving Rachel. One has to remember that just a few scenes ago, our hero Batman have to pull all sorts of high tech strings to get in a building in Hong Kong then get out. The Joker must have used his super power to stopped logic for him to walk out of the Bat's property.The Joker's super power gets overly charged in the second half of the movie. It all began after the poor judge got blow up in her car and the police chief gets poisoned, where the Joker puts a challenge to the Bat by abducting Rachel and Dent. It may seem smooth on the surface but if we think deeper, we would notice that, unless it was Joker's super power at work and resources rival Mr Wayne, both victims would never get abducted as they were snatch off the streets.We can pretend whatever happened in 2001 never happened in Gotham universe. But with two such important person killed a few scenes earlier, it spells open war between the gangs and law enforcement. Mr 'two faces to be' and Rachel who was working so closely with him and has connection with the Bat would be well protected by the good police and the Bat's high tech devices if I was writing the plot. As smart as Rachel's character was, she should know better not to leave the watchful eye of the Bat until the crisis was over! The abduction attempt would be immediately informed to the police and the Bat's sources. Dent would not be snatched without sparking a fire fight or an all out alert! You can't just have him walked in to a car be driven off and not be notice of his disappearance until it was too late. It is simply illogical for both simply vanished like that. The two aren't homeless on the streets! We can forgive the use of Joker power at the sequence where Lt Gordon was shot, but what happen next was unforgiving. Unless there are super natural forces at work, no one in the real world would set an entire hospital with the amount of demolition charges seen in the sequence while the place was fully operational all the time before that. We watch and enjoy the gang in Oceans 13 went to great length and effort to simulate an earth quake under the target hotel, and set in place all their tricks before the hotel was fully operational. If that wasn't enough proof of superior Joker power, he loaded two boat prepared and guarded by the army with stationed big barrel bombs, not in a pick-up truck loaded with bombs like the one seen in the science fiction movie dejavu. There is no argument that sequence was great in execution but it would never have happen the way it was shown in a realistic world that follows real logic! Then, I wonder how many men Joker has under his disposal to help him round up so many hostages in the building. Logic tells us the bigger the operation the more attention it would draw, it would be impossible for the law enforcement not to aware all those are hostages instead of Joker's gang.Where is the realism? Well, Joker already explained to us: he does not play by rules! So this movie has no rules on the plot! For me, the second half of the movies is nothing but a few great set pieces sew together by illogical lines. These illogical plot elements totally destroy the movie's credibility and realism.I am not picking bones out of an egg. I simply apply common sense on the plot; therefore I will stop short of praising this film as a great logical 'normal' movie. It is a great Batman / comic movie never less, a great piece of entertainment if the audiences are willing to over look all those flaws."
7717,True,"Christopher Nolan. 9,1 ?? 4th best movie of all time???? Comeon already!! That is just stupid... Fine movie, but not without flaws. For example, Batman has just survived, well, everything and beaten up most of the world + a swat team. He knows where Heath is and can see the dogs. Yet he is totally overwhelmed and gets a kicking. Why? Because the Joker is the main bad guy. That is lame and predictable. The joker's force is that he is brilliant and ruthless. He does not possess super strength. And what's up with Batman needing 1/15th of a second to take out 10 baddies, when he misses a 7 second opportunity at other times.. Just because it's fantasy doesn't mean that it shouldn't comply to it's own laws and logic. A red thread of consequences is never more important than telling a ""supernatural"" story. One last thing. What is up with that stuffy nose?? Every time he talks he never closes his mouth because he can't breath through his nose. Looks ridiculous. Oh well.. I didn't like Batman begins. I hated Katie whats her name. Cruise. Maggie is a hundred times better. And Gotham City does get it's own dark character in this one. So the choice is 6 or 7. But even with Katie replaced and Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and a good Gary Oldman in it, I can't give it more than 6. He is called batman! He has a costume with a cape and bat ears.. Get a grip people!!!! I give it a 6. I miss you Tim Burton. Oh well. Been a few hours now since I saw it. Didn't have the best rip, otherwise I might have been more impressed by the cinematography and vfx. And Heath does do a good job as Joker. However Bale is a dull batman and I just can't stand that they have to take a man in a cape so goddamn seriously. Jeez Louise, it's a comic.... So - vote is 6.5"
7718,True,"For some reason I was very distracted by everyone throughout referring to Batman as ""the"" Batman. Why not ""the"" superman and ""the"" spiderman? I find the depiction of mental illness generally or psychiatric conditions more specifically saddening. For instance, there were two individuals depicted prominently in the film as recruits of Joker (or the Joker) one classified as a ""paranoid schizophrenic"" (which ultimately led the Batman to have mercy on him as Dent (as if Aaron Eckhart could hurt anyone even with half of that trusting face) was apparently about to torture him further by presumably impaling him with a quarter. Enough with that quarter! The other was screaming like a typical of course mental patient behind bars about his voices. The Joker was himself presented as a potential mental case as well. Was not Dent concerned about ""psychotic"" ex boyfriends at the party. Clearly he did not mean medically in a psychotic state.So what's in a (yet another) stigmatizing depiction of people with mental health conditions negative portrayal as mental illness=violence towards others? In fact these recruits clearly had no morality to do the Joker's dirty devil's work. In fact the Green Mile look a like Black (of course) convict got to be the moral one to throw away the detonator. How very interesting.Arguably though not for sure - Heath Ledger was suffering from something - something that could be for sure be considered mental illness and stigmatized as well. Well anxiety seemed to be a given, was not depression, or something else? Maybe he even had a bout of psychosis as well, who really knows. Never mind the labels. Maybe he could have received better help from a friend, a doctor, society, or anyone. No one seems to know what to do with these types of problems, there are barriers to getting help especially even when people can reach out and others feels powerless to help. Movies would be a phenomenal step for reaching out to help conquer the stigma of mental health issues. Did ""Philadelphia"" help educate people on HIV and Aids. Tom Hanks is so loved anything he does works.What does not help the stigma is characterizing people with schizophrenia as immoral, desperate, violent people.That's why I didn't love the dark knight, THE batman."
7719,True,"A brilliant superhero film. Heath Ledger did a great job. A flawless film. Even better then Iron Man. I saw this movie twice. First time I saw it was the day after it came out. Second time was on August 29, 2008, This film is great. 5 out of 5 stars. If you haven't seen it, the stop reading this review, then go see it. I promise that you will love it. The Best Batman movie ever. Should win Best picture. Don't take anybody under the age of 8 or 9 because it could scare them. I will be buying it when it comes out on DVD. 8 out of 10. A+. This film is better the Batman Begins. If you liked Batman Begins, then you will love this. The ending was great. I think the Joker should be in the next one but I do not think that that person can beat Mr.Ledger. RIP Heath Ledger. Go see it now."
7720,True,"I'm not going to dwell on the most obvious issue, which seems to cloud most peoples' assessment of this movie. Heath Ledger.It is an awe-inspiring part that he turns in and he rightly deserves at least a nod come academy award time.Anyway, simply put, TDK re-writes the rule book for a so-called 'Super-hero' movies.The texture, score and characterisation lend the film more of a crime-saga tone, than anything else. It is one of the best comic-book adaptation movies ever made, but it should certainly not be the #3 on the IMDb all-time list.When the Amazon crowd (TEN OUT OF TEN!!!! LOL!) stop reviewing the film then a more balanced score should be achieved.I cannot wait for the next one, but please Nolan, don't go back on your word and write-in a part for the Penguin. Stick to your guns and use edgier villains and more indie actors to pull off the parts.8.8 out of 10."
7721,True,"I can't start talking about this movie in terms of its hype. No other movie, as far as I remember, had so many expectations from it than this one....and believe me, I have watched quite a lot of them. But somehow, only this one was able to give me goose bumps. What makes this latest installment of Batman so special for me, is the mere fact how complicated it is. And I know that for most of us, this doesn't really work for a summer block-buster. Nolan has taken a very bold and ambitious step in trying to make a beacon of hope for those of us, who want more than just another popcorn flick, just another movie based on a comic and just another action thriller with lots of explosions. Well, I, for one, really admire him for his courage. And from the reviews I have read, and the response it has received from general public (in terms of box office), I have to say......So do the many others. There isn't a lot to say, after all that has been said by everyone who was compelled to give his/her two cents. But, somehow, there is void there, which many of us have/might have failed to see. And that may be only discovered (IMHO) after multiple viewings. The very reason that makes it mammoth of a movie i.e. complicated and a long over drawn plot, is the very reason that makes it a little pedestrian. This was my opinion after I had watched it 3 times. But somehow, another viewing, all the pieces fell into their place. All I can say, is that this movie is way too layered, for a summer blockbuster. It's really a piece of art, which you can only enjoy once you have seen it miles away from the conventional bounds of a particular popcorn no-brainer movie. There are many examples, but I will state only one here. The way the movie ended, seemed like a stretch a quite unnecessary. I also thought that there was no need for batman to take the blame. But then after another viewing, I thought, I know why. This is because; he has to become more than a hero. A line that seemed like a cliché the first time. But, No..It was not. He had to change the minds of the people about him, so that he could be able to do more than what a hero does. Which other action movie has a climax based on an answer after soul searching? This may be way too much for a lot of us to understand and this should be one of the reasons for this movie to be such a big success and not just the performance by Late Heath Ledger. For me the most important thing was the dialogues. They were subtle yet eloquent. Action was better than the previous installment as well. Besides, having learnt that there were less CGI used than your average action flick, was also very good refreshing. That said, it is not without its flaws. Some technology used, is not very plausible. The way, Two-face transforms into a villain, may seem like understandable at first..but doesn't really hold up, once you consider, why he didn't kill the joker, when he had the chance. The way, the movie stretches and keeps on going to include at least two features in one, also makes it a little over the top. But, even after all that, one has to take into account the complexity of the plot, loyalty to its source material, and the will of the Chris Nolan to make it critical study of the world we live in. No one said that art is perfect (unless, it's abstract). Things change with the seeing eyes and one cannot dismiss what they see (Unless it's criticism just for the sake of criticism). But in the end, after all is said and done, one has to seewhat I can see and that is, changing the way summer blockbusters are these days. If you have not watched this movie, and it really doesn't matter the type of movies that you like, WATCH IT (with an open mind). It transcends the genre, it represents. Lastly, what gets to me, is this talk about how good a movie it is? Does it really deserve an Oscar? Its current position on IMDb top 250? ..What is all that? Why can't we just watch a movie and not try to make another argument based on our personal likes and dislikes. I have read all the comments of the people who think, it deserves 1 out of 10. I don't agree with them, but I don't have a bone to pick with them either. What matters is that for many sensible people, it's just a movie. It's not perfect. It may have offended many batman fans, by being not the way they envisioned a batman movie. Still, it has its appeal and mostly, it is different from all the other movies based on comics. For those, who wouldn't listen; why not try to save your energy for more important issues? My opinion is, it's a great movie. It will stand the test of time, and has raised the bar for all the action, thriller and comic movies."
7722,True,"""The dark knight"" length is on the long side, but still a good movie. I see a lot of post 9-11 in ""The dark Knight"". The Joker is like a terrorist who destroys without motive. Harvey Dent is the out of control administration which has to appear strong and good to keep society's hopes and aspirations balanced. ""The dark night"" is the CIA, secret and clandestine, who's role is one of protector. The cell phone tap is similar to the Patriot act argument. When is too far too far? Batman never kills, unlike the Joker, in order to hunt a monster one does not become one. Self-sacrificing Batman chooses the good of the people over his girlfriend. The Joker loves to test people resolve. Batman is a unsung hero who's successes have to be unknown. Like Iran/Contra Batman takes the rap unfairly. Secrets are burnt for the good of everyone. ""The Dark knight"" rides again lurking into the shadow combating the chaos evil brings. 7 out of 10 covert operations for ""The dark Knight""."
7723,True,"Being a huge fan of Batman Begins (10/10!) I was as excited as any movie lover for The Dark Knight. And when the hype built up to a historic point, I was PSYCHED, man! I couldn't wait! So now, afterwards, I wonder what went wrong. I wonder if I've just seen too many superhero and action movies and I've been desensitized by them, or if I'm just insane (or stupid) for being a 20-year-old who didn't adore The Dark Knight.From the beginning, something struck me as being a little off. The character of Batman/Bruce Wayne was not the same. He lacked the inner turmoil and the depth that we saw in the first movie. Not only this, but the film itself seemed to lack depth. None of the major themes of the movie came up until about an hour into it. I also could not ignore the sickening camera movements and use of music... Two characters would be having a relatively calm and simple conversation, and the camera would circle around them and fly every which way. Meanwhile, the music score sounds like it was misplaced, and it should be accompanying a fight scene. I think this complaint is just an example of what I found generally sickening about the Dark Knight. It takes all the techniques deemed effective in a modern action/suspense movie, and it piles them on to the point of exhaustion. I'm not just talking about the technical aspects of the film. It just fails to overstep the bounds of its genre. It's chock full of suspenseful (but old) little tricks and plot devices- dead characters suddenly appearing alive, events that have the sole purpose of giving the viewer a jolt (like the body smashing into the window), ridiculously high-tech equipment, villains who are complete geniuses with explosives and who force the main character to choose between two people he loves. I could go on if I thought a little bit harder.The gaudy style is a lesser tragedy than how dumbed down this movie is, though. In Batman Begins (Some might say it's unfair to compare the two movies... Well, I say it's not. This is a sequel to Batman Begins) there is plenty more to digest than what meets the eye. The viewer is treated to an amazing transformation of a man, thanks to the conquering of his greatest fears. The message was crystal clear, and it was amazingly thoughtful for a comic book movie. The Dark Knight, unfortunately, doesn't get very far past its identity as a comic book movie, giving us the usual ""moral dilemma"", ""right and wrong"", ""Am I going too far?"" stuff that I honestly don't find that interesting, because, how many of us have to decide on a daily basis whether or not it's right to kill some one who has killed? It sure hasn't happened to me lately. We all face fear, and that's why Batman Begins is so engaging. It has appeal as something other- something MORE- than a comic book movie. The Dark Knight does not.And now for the little things that I couldn't figure out how to put smoothly in a paragraph. There were definitely problems with the plot. Certain elements of the story seemed to disappear, or weren't resolved properly. Take, for instance, the phony Batmans. What happened to them? No one knows. I don't remember any resolution for that. Also, the whole subplot with the mob annoyed me, in general. It seemed as if it shouldn't have existed; or at least, its role in this film was much too big. The only point it seemed to have was as something for Harvey Dent to attack to show how powerful he was. Why does the Joker come up to them and make a proposition with them? They turn it down, and ultimately, nothing comes out of the whole thing. Also, the scene where Batman crashes his motorcycle in order to avoid killing the Joker, and then when he saves him from falling- that was PATHETIC. The standard superhero schlock of letting the bad guy go- in this case, one of the most convincingly evil and sadistic bad guys EVER. This movie could've had so much more kick if he had just manned up and killed him. How awesome would that have been? But no, of course it has to abide by the freaking superhero code. Sad.Oh, but wait, there were good things about this movie! I did give it a 6 out of 10, you know. After all the negative things I've typed, it seems like I would have to type just as much positive stuff to justify my rating. But no, I can do so in just two sentences (one is a fragment, actually). 1: I was entertained. 2: The Joker. As far as 1 is concerned: despite all the things about this film that bugged me and made me think ill of it, it still got to whatever part of my brain it is that makes me enjoy stuff. Like I said, I AM 20 years old, and I'm also male, and certain things are just highly enjoyable to me and most people of my age and I can't really say why. Well, the Dark Knight is overflowing with those things. There's people falling off buildings, people getting thrown off fire escapes, senseless betrayal, trickery (The hostages! awesome), truck chases, Morgan Freeman, and obviously, explosions. The list goes on. Yes, these things were entertaining and enjoyable, but they don't redeem the bad qualities of the film at all. They just make it watchable- perhaps even rewatchable. As far as 2 is concerned: Heath Ledger deserves an Oscar nomination. It helps that his character was written to PERFECTION, of course, but Heath was really something else. The voice, the tongue thing, the walk- everything about the Joker just oozed chaos and anarchy. If I see this movie again, I'll probably space off whenever he's not on screen."
7724,True,"This was actually much better than I'd expected. It's much better than the previous effort, 'Batman Begins', which was actually pretty droll and uninteresting.Gotham City, (thankfully, minus the overly grandiose CGI of the previous film), is caught between Batman and his new admirer, and self-designated philosophical opponent, The Joker. The story isn't anything new, but it's played out well, for the most part. At some points, it tries to parody the current political scene in America, and it really comes off as corny and naive in its message of what the citizens of Gotham ""need"", as declared by the self-proclaimed overseers of the city. Here is where one begins to lose sympathy for this ""darker"" version of Batman, and D.A. Harvey Dent. They're both such megalomaniacal martyrs, that the Joker seems a refreshing change of pace. I found myself wanting him to take out as many of his co-stars as possible...The Joker does pretty much carry the film, and having Heath Ledger play the infamous villain was probably my biggest reservation prior to seeing it, as all the films I'd seen him in previously were awful. He steps up to the part and really pulls it off, though. He's fun to watch, and the decision to give him no backstory is actually pretty clever, as it leaves the viewer open to speculate about exactly who, or by The Joker's estimation, what he is and why he's there. For the most part, he's acted out pretty much as we've seen him in the other Batman films/series, only this time he's in it purely for the masochistic fun of it. Even when he ""loses"" to Batman, he never actually loses.The whole Two-Face subplot plays out well until Harvey Dent actually becomes Two-Face, at which time the subplot moves too fast for the rest of the movie to handle. Hopefully he's not really dead (one of ALL the previous films' biggest mistakes was killing off the great villains). Good effects for Two-Face, though. There are other story elements that either drag, or aren't focused on enough, so I guess the film's biggest flaw is really pacing. Also, Nolan's purported ""realistic"" approach (an obvious misnomer in describing a film featuring Batman) is apparent and a definite improvement in his depiction of the city, but is often subverted by unlikely and even laughable dialogue, motivation, etc. Then again, this IS a fantasy excursion, but even for a film whose main character fights crime in a bat costume, the dialogue could have used some work.Not a bad film. I still think a comic book film should avoid taking itself THIS seriously because you always wind up with some unintended cheese when you try to play it too straight, and to that end, 'Batman Forever' is still my favorite Batman film, but I'd say this and the '89 film both run a close second. Both have similar flaws, but also, both are successful in much the same way, specifically in their somewhat unique depictions of the Joker."
7725,True,"As a fan of Batman, this is undoubtedly the most unpopular opinion of my entire life. But I cannot stand this movie. For me this is the most pretentious and overrated movie in the history of cinema. Heath Ledger's Joker was charismatic, but taking it away ... What do we have? We have a movie that makes Batman a mere supporting character in his own film. A Batman with no balls and no detective soul. Confused, messy, uninspired fights. Boring, lifeless, uninspired scenarios. A Gotham turned into some another generic and commom American city. An overly dramatic, heavy, humorless and violent tone. Batman is usually dark, yes, but one thing is to be dark, another is to want to sound like a play by Shakespeare. TDK takes itself very seriously and this sucks. Oh for God's sake, at the end we are talking just about a guy who dresses in bat and walks around town for fighting crime. It doesn't have to be complicated, it doesn't have to be too complex, it doesn't have to be very philosophical. I just want to look at the movie and think, ""This is a Super-Hero movie!"" Exactly the same feeling that Spiderman 1, 2 and Burton movies always makes me feel every time I watch. The Dark Knight is not a genuine Super-Hero movie. It's simply a police story that happens in a generic city by chance called Gotham where by chance Batman and the Joker are inserted, with Batman being only a supporting character."
7726,True,"Immediately the title is off-putting, ""The Dark Knight"". Who in their right mind names a Batman Movie ""The Dark Knight"". You could write me an essay on how it is a brilliant title which is deep on so many levels but I won't have it. The inclusion of the word knight only makes me think of medieval times and the only thing medieval about this film is that it is a perfect form of medieval torture. Every time I am forced to watch this whether in class or at home because ""some"" deem it the best movie ever made a part of me wants to die.Here is a plot summary of the Dark Knight if you have been lucky enough not to have watched it. (Joker confronts mob saying he can kill Batman; mob think he is crazy. Joker broadcasts plan and says people will die until Batboy turns himself in, people think he's crazy. Harvey Dent wants to take down whole mob with one swoop, Mob thinks Dent is crazy.) That is only half of the plot and adds up for an hour and a half of boring predictable screen filler. So many subplots and characters overcrowd this movie. With the characters they have in this movie they could have made 4 great films but instead they made one cluster disaster. The other half of the movie isn't even worth mentioning it is so bad.The only good thing in the second half of the movie is where Rachael and Harvey are rigged to explosives at different locations and Batman has to pick one so he chooses Rachael. It turns out to be Harvey so Rachael dies! Yes! Thank you! I have never wanted a main character to die so much in my life. She is a useless character who just seems to dig her way into the story but adds nothing to it. Bruce considers her his love interest but she doesn't even like him so it is perfect that they killed her off. I applaud them for this. I applaud them because they completely disregarded logic in order to kill her. Surely there was enough time to save both if some police officers in the area did their job for once and went to the addresses. But no they did the right thing and it helps me sleep at night knowing Rachael is dead.The Joker is considered the start of the show but he is a really lazily developed character. He has no backstory and even the pathetic writers didn't give him a back story to work with. Heath Ledgers voice wasn't even used for filming because the Imax projectors were so loud so all sounds had to be added post production. Maybe this is why the joker doesn't feel scary or realistic. They ruined everything they had by dubbing Heath ledger. It makes me feel entirely detached from the whole movie not having original sounds.The Joker is a waste of space. He is not at all like what the Joker should have been in terms of his plans. Jokers usually generate chaos and disregard anything fair. But in this awful adaptation he acts more like Harvey Dent in the comics with his 50/50 scenarios, like the boat scene. The two villains are too much alike. They could have created this movie to have focused on just Harvey or the Joker but instead we end up with two undeveloped characters. How do you mess up this badly when they literally own the rights to some of the best comic book characters in history? It's like being given the instructions to a Lego kit and eating the Lego instead. How do you mess up this badly?The Jokers purpose in the movie is to push Batman to his limits in terms of morals. Batman has one rule; he will not kill. But what does he do at the end to Harvey Dent?!?! We are just meant to overlook this? He was willing to kill for one boy but won't kill the joker who threatens a whole city. If Batman got a Glock and killed anyone who threatened innocent people, this would have been a very short movie. If Batman was willing to kill for greater good which defies his whole moral code, then the whole character is useless.In conclusion this movie is an awful comic book adaptation which is about as funny as Schindler's list. This movie will make you send a complaint to piratebay.com for allowing you to illegally download this movie. Everyone involved with the making of this film should be publicly shamed for the rest of their natural lives. The people who made this film are the sort of scum that lie about having cancer so they can claim the benefits. I hope every night they wake up asking themselves why did I ever get involved with that garbage. This movie is still better than Batman Vs Superman Dawn of Justice. Will Batman ever get justice and have a good movie?"
7727,True,"Watching The Dark Night was torture for me, maybe after Batman and Robin, these Nolan movies are the WORST of all. I mean: 1. could you understand any word of the ridiculously deep and unnatural voice of Bale as Batman, I thought he was ill from throat cancer or something, and 2. what was that Gotham City (New York) in broad daylight all the time - it's Batman movie not Sun hero movie, and 3. was there any plot about the Joker and his motives - I don't think so, and 4. who would like this ugly NOT aerodynamical batmobile with tires placed in front of the car, OK I actually liked the bike but the batmobile was ugly and ... ugly, and 5. Harvey Dent - the villain (good guy or whatever he is) who was completely out of character, remember Batman Forever - there Harvey The Two Face was a well made villain played by great actor, and 6. the ridiculous batsmartphone device which makes Batman to see everyone in the city what he or she was doing, and 7. what kind of Batman (city ""Guardian"") is that, who doesn't care about wrecking millions of dollars in people's personal damages (damaging and blowing random city cars and a lot of other stuff), and 8. at the end of the Dark Night why they did not they blame the Joker for all the crimes, he was killing people and blowing buildings up the whole movie, and 9. this was supposed to be Batman movie (Fantasy Adventure Action), not ridiculous realistic Crime looking hero movie, the bright modern looking atmosphere of this flick more suits to The Departed, The Godfather, LA Confidential and so on, it's Batman movie it's not supposed to be realistic, ...... Bottom line: awful movie !!!"
7728,True,"The only reason I give this movie a three is because the portrayal of the joker was interesting. Even then, it wasn't a faithful portrayal. A fresh take, yes. The other installments to the series, I gave a 1. As a fan of the 80's cartoon, I am dismayed by the success of these movies. Batman's voice is stupid and laughable. It isn't cool. He isn't cool. This franchise tries way too hard and fails. The cell phone eyes? that was retarded. The fact that he has some other guy make most of his gadgets is insulting to the source material. He in no way comes across a great detective or even that smart. In fact, he's pretty stupid in these movies. All the characters other than the joker are bland. This is terrible, as Batman is one of the most interesting super heroes. I did not like their version of Alfred at all. It isn't Alfred. It's just Michael Caine playing himself. And in the later installment, they even managed to make Robin boring. He's suppose to be the lighthearted element! There is little to no humor, which I think is one of the main factors contributing to the why these movies and it's characters seem so bland and contrived. The action...? Bland and forgettable as well. If I wasn't familiar with the cartoon series, I would have already forgotten about this movie and who everyone is. I think the only reason this rates higher than Thor the Dark World is because Batman is a better known, more popular character originally. They came so deceivingly close to making a suitable Batman, that they clearly fooled millions. Well I am here to speak to those less desperate ones with clearer heads. These movies are an over-hyped disappointment. By trying to make Batman ""more realistic"" they took away the fantastic film noir theme that the world's greatest detective deserves. They turned an intelligent and intimidating character into a unintelligible dimwit with some lackluster fighting skills and a cowl. Any other super hero could outwit and overpower this interpretation of the caped crusader. Dc should just stick to TV and stop messing up their own characters on the big screen. The end."
7729,True,"You know why everyone loves this movie its because of the serious close to early Batman(minus the pink gloves)and its refusal to make a funny character funny. Yes the actual Batman comics are dark and Heath Ledger and Morgan Freeman are the only two good actors in the movie but they screwed up the BIGGEST aspect of the Joker.While yes he is crazy and terrifying, he also needs to be funny!!! When Bat mans stale and has a stupid voice Two face is shoved in and is generic and the Joker is boring generic crazy guy who makes jokes that don't have a good punch line. But hey Im the kind of guy the would must rather listen to Mark Hammel instead."
7730,True,"As a huge superhero fan I have to say The Dark Knight was one of the best movies I've seen. Christian Bale IS Batman, and Heath Ledger has brought The Joker on a whole different level of crazy. The planning that went into this movie was done at a perfect level, there wasn't too much fillers and it kept me interested the entire time. If you want to see a great hero movie, this is for you. Every character was well casted and brought to life perfectly. I've been inspired by Heath to play a role that well and bring an iconic character to a whole new level. Stunts, explosions, and special effects were properly used. I found myself asking, ""What would I do in this situation?"" and nothing I could have expected came from this film. It makes you excited and nervous what crazy thing Joker will do next and how Batman will stop him. I believe it's one of the best movies out there."
7731,True,"Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight changed things forever. There's no going' back. It is one of the few films that was thought to be one thing, and ended up becoming one of the greatest films of all time. This was the first movies I saw where I talked about things that were discussed in the film itself, and what it must mean to be a hero like Batman. But more importantly, the acting, writing, directing, and the cinematography make this a rich and tragic film that will forever stand the test of time.The story begins a couple months after the events of ""Batman Begins"" (in a noticeably more realistic Gotham City) and batman has petty criminals and the mob running scared. The determined new D.A., Harvey Dent, emerges as another symbol of hope for Gotham City, albeit a more lawful position as Batman. Then, enter The Joker, a demented terrorist who sets up unbelievably dark and twisted situations to test the moral compasses of Batman, Dent, and even Commissioner Gordon. As a man, Bruce Wayne has a crisis, is Batman doing more harm than he is good? he learns that he may become something more awful than the Joker just to stop him.Director Christopher Nolan leaves behind all the jokiness and sometimes unfulfilled soul searching of the previous Batman films and with his trilogy, this more than others redefines what a superhero movie can be. He shows the characters for what they are, flawed but idealistic, as well as struggling to deal with the Joker as they themselves descend into a very dark place. Nolan, and his brother Jonathon, have given us a very polished and well thought out story by itself. This is the second film where I actually paid attention and love the story, characters, and became emotionally invested (the first was Toy Story long ago) And then there is the acting. The acting is top notch by all actors. The real star of this movie is the scene-stealing Joker, played by Heath Ledger. He transforms the Joker from all previous incarnations and puts a very demented and modern twist on it. He truly believes he is humanity fully realized and an agent of chaos (the theme of the film) He wants to turn the Gothamites into wild animals who will, according to him, ""eat each other, when the chips are down."" Ledger very deservedly, although posthumously, won the Oscar for this portrayal, and is still being hailed as one of the best villains in any medium.Christian Bale is in top form as Bruce Wayne/Batman and gives you a tender and heartbreaking side to the character. He does begin to build his mythos but struggles when people doubt him and push their fears onto what he stands for. I will say the actor who really got me invested was Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. Two-Face is one of the more tragic villains of the Batman rogue's gallery. He is a truly moral and good man fallen from grace by tragedy in his life, losing Rachael to one of Joker's vicious traps (It hurts Bruce too, in a love triangle that for once in my life I thought was very well constructed and perfect) He becomes an evil and twisted brute who relies on a coin to make a decision to kill for him. ""Chance. Unbiased, Unprejudiced, FAIR."" He too was a villain I thought equal to the Joker, but in a different way. it is rather emotional when things happen to him, and that is the sign of a great storytelling and acing approach. Commissioner Gordon, played by Gary Oldman, presents a man who knows the system is corrupt, but remains idealistic and knows that Batman is doing good for the city. And at the end knows he will have to atone and be accountable for any sins he may have committed over the course of the film.The action scene are a wonder to behold. They look real and was pulled off with little to no computers, all real stunts. Nothing was over the top at all, even Two-face's design looked scary, and oddly enough, like he got burned by something on one half of his body. Every incarnation before this looks awful by comparison. Every scene in this film showcases cinematographer Wally Pfister's rich color palette/lighting scheme and his keen eye for detail even in the simplest scenes. He and Nolan will go down as one of the great cinematographer/director duos ever.This film is a a perfect work of art. The Dark Knght really was a game changer when released in 2008, showing the industry and fans what a ""comic-book movie"" can be just as Richard Donner's Superman had done in 1978. This is a movie that I loved dearly on my first screening, and one that will not disappear off my list."
7732,True,"I know this is considered the end all and be all of comic book movies. Let's face it this movie fails on so many levels. I am all in for changing characters for the better but this is terrible. We'll start off with Christian Bale and his voice he sounds like he overworked his throat. This movie would of been perfect to add Robin and bring the dynamic duo to the big screen. I mean what is Batman without Robin? Let's move on to the villains shall we? Ledger Joker was well a.... Joke he took all the fun out of the role. Two Face was okay I guess I myself prefer Tommy Lee Jones(I might be a little bias being a Texan myself) He was truly the only thing that made this movie watchable and made me begrudgingly give it two stars instead on the one star it deserves. I think we can all agree that this far from the masterpiece of comic book movies that was Adam West's Batman movie,"
7733,True,"There were just too many ""what the ???""'s in this movie for me. Like the hospital blowing up. Wouldn't anyone notice someone placing all the explosives...etc...there's lots of things like that in the movie where the Joker somehow comes out of nowwhere to be the most powerful villain in the city.His demise at the end is another worthless scene...I have no idea what happened.Batman's voice is very hard to understand at times.He has like 1 or 2 cool toys..that's it. James Bond out-does him there.Another love story...ugh. I had enough of that with Spiderman...not to mention that she looks EXACTLY like spiderman's girlfriend.The action scenes are good, but nothing extreme and there aren't a lot of them.Of course, you knew the commish was gonna get it when you heard the Lt.'s name was Gordon.I personally think Aliens or T2 should be #1, but hey, that's just me. There is NO WAY you will come out of the theater like I did when I saw Aliens or T2.Almost every scene is basically dark/and or wet. Typical batman movie. Kind of annoying.7/10 because it was a pretty good summer flick. It might be a while before I watch it again. I think the more you watch it, the more it ""might"" get better...at least, that's what I hope."
7734,True,One if the best movie I've ever seen... Christian bale and Heath Ledger did well job. Hats iff to these guys... I've never seen batman series ever but coz of them i watch the while dark knighr trilogy... Hope we could see bale again reprising his role....
7735,True,"Recently i did a review saying that Batman & Robin is the only decent one from the Batman movie series, well iv'e changed my mind, The Dark Knight is more entertaining than all the 90s ones combined. Batman Begins set the scene and paved the way for The Dark Knight to happen. It's understandable why the movie series got dark. Batman has always had a dark element, the 90s ones were slightly dark, but they were too comedic at the same time and they now all look like a joke, something had to change and they decided to take the dark route with these movies. They're dark, but not too dark. The title is appropriate for the overall plot- theme-story line. The name 'The Dark Knight' was used casually in a line of dialogue in the 90s movies, but was never taken seriously.The Dark Knight has great performances and good directing. Heath Ledger did a good job playing The Joker, but i personally think that Two-face is a much more interesting character, but he does not get that much screen- time, the VFX done for his face is also very clever, the special effects look so much more sophisticated compared to the Tommy Lee Jones version with his painted-on-face-makeup."
7736,True,"Batman - The Dark Knight (EUA, 2008)Batman Begins, as the name suggests, was a promise of a new beginning (not a remake or a comeback) to Batman's story. We needed to forget Tim Burton's and Joel Schumacher's movies and all those ""colorful and exaggerated things"". The main idea is to show the Batman in a real world, like ours, with people willing to change Gotham City. Batman  The Dark Knight starts two years after the events of Batman Begins. The director Christopher Nolan builds his new plot around a more experienced and altruistic Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) than ever. If Nolan, in Batman Begins, introduced to the general public a complex main character, full of hatred and bitterness (as a strong sense of justice), in this case, Nolan opens a new world of possibilities, raising the dramatic elements to a new level. After two years since Batman's (Christian Bale) emergence, the criminals in Gotham City have much to fear. Working with Alfred (Michael Caine) and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), receiving help from the lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the public promoter Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Batman fights against the organized crime, headed by Salvatore Maroni (Eric Roberts), which is established in every Gotham City corner. This time, Katie Holmes (Rachel Dawes in Batman Begins) does not return to the role of the love interest. Magie Gyllenhall (Rachel Dawes in Batman - The Dark Knight) takes Katie Holmes place. However, a new threat appears in Gotham, as the Joker (Heath Ledger) wants to prove that anyone who has a bad day can face madness. Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker deserves some comments. The early tragic death of Heath Ledger, in January of 2008, when he accidentally overdosed on a lethal combination of pills, being found unconscious in his apartment, moved a legion of fans of the actor and the character, proving to be a factor that boosted the film's box office. Ledger's performance will remain in the history of the cinema. The Joker created by Ledger and Nolan is a psychopath, a brash murderer and an anarchist. He has just one rule: he lives without rules, he lives in an anarchically world and he wants to spread chaos. The way he talks, moves and operate contribute to the fact that his Joker cannot be compared to any other version of the character, even Jack Nicholson's, who became worldwide known for his acting as the Joker. Nicholson's Joker is much more like the Joker created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger, in 1940 - a thief who repeatedly bothers Batman. Nolan's version of the Joker, created together with his brother and co-producer Jonathan Nolan, and with Heath Ledger, really scares everyone, even a grown man. The character's construction is simple, deep and creepy. The director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan tell us a gripping story in 152 minutes, proposing just one thing: How would the Batman be in the real world? Well, Christopher and his brother seek in dozens of comic books this answer. However, the movie uses three main comics as inspiration: Batman: The long Halloween (written by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale), Batman: Year One (written by the great Frank Miller) and finally Batman: The Killing Joke (written by Alan Moore). We have here strong influences, mostly in the Joker found in Batman: The Killing Joke, in which the villain wants to prove to Batman that the trigger of madness and insanity is just a bad day (a really bad day). By the way, two moments deserve a special comment: the truck's chase and the hospital explosion. The realism, created by Christopher Nolan, goes beyond anything he'd done so far. The scenes are captured in real time, in just one roll, without CGI, deserving our applause. Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy is a representative of the fact that superhero movies can be serious and profitable. The Dark Knight Rises, launched in 2012, cannot overcome his predecessor though it manages to successfully finish the story started in Batman Begins, which opened a range of possibilities to Warner Bros. Entertainment."
7737,True,"this movie is one of the best movies ever made and heath ledger's interpretation is magnificent. the film shows the corrupt nature of man, which can be constrained with minimal effort to change his convictions. Looking with a little clutter in his inner world can turn everything into chaos."
7738,True,"One of the best movie till date. Loved the acting of Christian Bale , Gary Oldman especially.All must watch this movie , if you haven't still watched it you should now.Ledger's performance is monumental, but The Dark Knight lives up to it. Nolan cements his position as Hollywood's premier purveyor of blockbuster smarts  and the Batbike is kinda cool, too.Big, bold, and bruising, this is a prime example of how a high- budget, high-profile comic-book sequel can still be an actual movie -- well-made, exciting, invested, and engaging. This sequel to 'Batman Begins' is mesmerizing and thought-provoking. But it shouldn't have been named after the good guy. This is the Joker's court, and he's not looking for a laugh"
7739,True,"But to say that The Godfather is simply ""influential"" is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as ""a movie about gangsters"". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forced insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believably."
7740,True,I cant think of anyone else as batman anymore. This is how a superhero movie should be. Not following the same pattern as every other superhero movie Christian Bale is the best role as batman and Heath Ledger is a perfect definition of the joker. he was born for this role and it is so sad that i died. The dark night rises has not a so god but has one of the greatest endings i have ever seen
7741,True,"I was very impressed with this film. Great visuals, plenty of action, and a great plot! The characters fit their roles very well. I also enjoyed the bit of history about Batman that was included surrounding his training. They did a good job with the villains, not to easy to defeat. There was quite a bit of suspense. Highly recommend."
7742,True,"Batman has always been my favorite superhero ever since the first time I heard about him because he his human with no powers, also he is much more questionable than any other superhero. The story of the film is about Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon, and new district attorney Harvey Dent beginning to succeed in rounding up the criminals that plague Gotham City. They are unexpectedly challenged when a mysterious criminal mastermind known as the Joker appears in Gotham. Batman's struggle against the Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to ""confront everything he believes"" and to improve his technology (which introduces the recreation of the Batcycle, known as the Batpod and the Batsuit was redesigned) to stop the madman's campaign of destruction. During the course of the film, a love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent and Rachel Dawes.There are now six Batman films and I must say that The Dark Knight is the best out of all of them. The title is good because that is what Batman actually is. It has been 3 years for the adventure to continue from Batman Begins but that entire wait was worth it. Gotham city is very Gothic looking and is very haunting and visionary. The whole movie is charged with pulse-pounding suspense, ingenious special effects and riveting performances from a first- rate cast especially from Heath Ledger who gave an Oscar nomination performance for best-supporting-actor. It is a shame that he can't see his terrific work on-screen. The cinematography is excellent which is made so dark & sinister that really did suit the mood of the film. Usually, sequels don't turn out to be better than the original but The Dark Knight is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original like The Godfather 2. I also really liked the poster where the building is on fire in a Bat symbol & Batman is standing in front of it. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director and his film Memento is one of my most favorite films. He hasn't made 10 movies yet and 3 of them are already on the IMDb top 250. Overall The Dark Knight is the kind of movie that will make the audience cheer in the end instead of throwing fruit & vegetables on the screen."
7743,True,"I remember watching all of the trailers for this film and all of the clips before the movie came out (a cardinal sin for moviegoers, I know), and the film still found a way to surprise me and blow me away. I watched it again on a whim recently, probably my 15th viewing or so, and I still noticed new things that left me impressed. Nolan has constructed a story that resembles a classic tragedy or epic than a superhero caper. He turns the traditional superhero arc on its head by centering the struggle not around a villain chasing after an object, money, or even outright power, but around the concept of justice and what it means for Gotham. And he does so through his three main roles in Batman, Harvey Dent and the Joker. The three characters arcs are interwoven. Harvey Dent needs Batman in order to finish off the mob, and Batman looks to pass the torch so he can be free of the burden of crime fighting as well as (and maybe more importantly) be with Rachel, who happens to be dating Dent. This in itself is a set-up for an interesting story, but then Nolan has to throw the Joker in there for good measure, and turns the story from being good, to being one of the greats. The Joker isn't possible without the environment Batman has created, and his ultimate goal isn't possible without Dent. I haven't even begun to talk about the acting performances and the directing, which are also things to behold. There's so much to this film, it is worth watching multiple times and focusing your attention on different aspects each viewing. That is the mark of a truly great film that will live on for decades to come."
7744,True,"This film is my number one film of all times , for me the acting the directing the cinematography , and the writing ESPECIALLY the writing oh my god , totally blew any other movie in my opinion , batman at his finest , Bruce Wayne at his fines , and also the Joker , i think this is the most enjoyable super hero movie that carries a true story within ."
7745,True,"In the movie, when Batman caught the Joker I felt like the movie is over. But then it goes beyond the expectations and movie takes a great turn. It has lots of amazing moments specially about ""The Joker"". I have never seen this level of negative acting. One is when the Joker come out of hospital and trigger the remote but it doesn't work and suddenly the bomb gets exploded that's the height of madness."
7746,True,"Every time I watch this it impresses me more. Nolan and company took ""Batman Begins"", which was already a great movie, and made a sequel that put the whole world on notice. This is now the gold standard, in fact this goes beyond that, this is the diamond standard. Every super hero movie to come out after this, has the task of trying to better it. I don't think that's ever gonna happen. There might be good super hero movies, even great ones, but this goes way beyond that, we're talking light years here people! This isn't just a super hero movie, you could remove DC from this entirely and it would still be flawless. The movie does benefit from the characters portrayed here, but the story is ultimately about a changing world. Bruce has been able to slowly bleed the mob to death since becoming Batman in the first movie, but in doing so, he's made them desperate. The mob puts their faith in the Joker, thinking they can control him, they're wrong. Joker can't be controlled, he's different than every other person the mob, the cops, and Bruce have dealt with. He's not after money, or power, he does these things just because he can.Just like with crime, the movie focuses on people adapting to change. Instead of criminals with ""rules"" or a moral code, Gotham has to deal with a changing dynamic. Similar to some criminals in real life who aren't after money or other monetary things. Just when Bruce and company think they're playing their game, they're really playing Joker's. He's one step ahead of them the whole movie, as Bruce and the police force become more and more desperate in their attempts to stop this madman. ""The Dark Knight"" shows that people can fall from grace, like Dent, or Joker's speech about society eating each other when the chips are down. But it can also show how people can rise up and make sacrifices to better society, like the people on the ferries who can't take the lives of others they think are less than them, or Bruce taking the fall for Harvey's crimes because he realizes Dent is the hero Gotham needs. It shows the sacrifices people have to make sometimes to better the world, even if it means lying to the public to maintain order. Does the Joker win? Technically yes, but not entirely. He wins in the sense that he corrupts Dent and shows the audience that even the best of people can become evil, but he loses in the sense that Bruce takes the blame for what Harvey did. Bruce is just a symbol, a name without a face, and if he has to sacrifice his image, in order to preserve the image of someone the people loved and stood behind, then so be it.The movie is stacked layer upon layer by genius, from the themes, to the characters, to the direction, it is 110% flawless. It's one of only two movies that I can 100% unironically give a rating of 6 out of 5 to, 11 out of 10 to. If I could rate this higher than a 10 on this site, I would in an instant. How good is this movie? It's been almost 10 years since it came out, and I can probably count on one hand the amount of movies that have come close to it's greatness. The plot's perfect, the direction is perfect, the acting is perfect, Heath Ledger gives a performance so good, I don't think it'll ever be topped. ""The Dark Knight"" set a new standard for not only super hero movies, but the world of film as well. I have nothing but respect for it, and it earns a well deserved place in my Top 10.R.I.P Heath Ledger"
7747,True,"its make me to love DC comics""The Dark Knight"" is not a simplistic tale of good and evil. Batman is good, yes, The Joker is evil, yes. But Batman poses a more complex puzzle than usual: The citizens of Gotham City are in an uproar, calling him a vigilante and blaming him for the deaths of policemen and others. And the Joker is more than a villain. He's a Mephistopheles whose actions are fiendishly designed to pose moral dilemmas for his enemies."
7748,True,"We have been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling. As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a very interesting character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there."
7749,True,"The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, co-produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Featuring the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second part of Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring an ensemble cast including Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Morgan Freeman. In the film, Bruce Wayne/Batman (Bale), Police Lieutenant James Gordon (Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart) form an alliance to dismantle organized crime in Gotham City, but are menaced by a criminal mastermind known as the Joker (Ledger) who seeks to undermine Batman's influence and create chaos."
7750,True,"There are moments in cinema history where everything comes together, cast, crew, writers, directors. This is one of those films. Aside from the terrible loss of Heath Ledger this melting pot of talent brought forth one of the best Batman films to date. From the lighting to the colors used it is just a spectacular amalgamation of creativity, intelligence and that perfect splash of crazy."
7751,True,"Although I don't think it is the fourth best movie ever made, as it is rated according to IMDb, I do think it stands head and shoulders above its super-hero peers, mainly because it is NOT a superhero movie. Batman is a mere mortal with lots of time to train himself physically and money to design the nifty gadgets he uses.Everybody on earth has seen this film, so no use regurgitating the plot. I think Heath Ledger's rendition of The Joker is a masterpiece. Every time he leaves the screen I keep waiting for him to come back. Ledger should have won the best actor Oscar rather than supporting actor, because this is really a two leading man film - Bale as Batman and Ledger as The Joker. I always liked Jack Nicholson's rendition of the Joker in the 1989 film directed by Tim Burton, but Ledger just blows Nicholson's performance away. Maybe it is because Nicholson's Joker had a past and an explanation for his behavior, maybe it is because, after all, Nicholson's Joker just seems to be the wild side of the real Jack Nicholson where Heath Ledger never steps out of character for the entire film. Ledger's Joker is like the devil decides to become incarnate, but unlike Ray Milland's devil in ""Alias Nick Beal"" shows his true self - somebody who wants to break the spirits of people, to turn them on one another, to wantonly destroy property, people, whatever. That's reinforced when the police can find no name, no past, no prints, no DNA, not even a label in his clothes when they arrest him. His past is a great big question mark. I like Michael Caine's Alfred - it's good to have someone with relevant past combat and guerrilla experience be a wise father figure to Wayne in this role rather than just a kindly museum piece. Likewise, Morgan Freeman is pitch perfect as Lucius and Wayne's version of Q - somebody who invents his gadgets and runs his business since this really is not where Wayne's mind is, Freeman gives the performance the perfect balance of humor, business acumen, and conscience. And finally I like the fact that Rachel, Bruce Wayne's love interest, is not played by someone who is some unrealistic 10.5/10. She's a cute girl, but her attributes lie in her mind and her heart as well.The negatives - I think Harvey's transformation into Two Face is a little too pat. I don't know why Batman has a totally different voice from Bruce Wayne. Is he doing that on purpose? And I think I found one editing error. Gordon in the end talks about how hard it will be to cover up Harvey/ Two Face's murders including ""two cops"". Harvey let crooked cop Ramirez live and just knocked her out. But if she had lived then Gordon and Batman's plan to cover up Harvey's crimes would never have worked because she would have known what happened. So which scene was wrongly included/scripted? I'd recommend it as one of the better films made since the turn of the century that was also a blockbuster."
7752,True,"Let me get the obvious out of the way... Heath Ledger is the best part of this movie. But usually when you have a performance that good, it makes the rest of the actors look like Kim Kardashian. Not this flick. Bale, Oldman, Eckhart, Caine, Gyllenhaal, Freeman, everyone had stellar acting. The use of practical effects and the general lack of CGI make the film a little cleaner. Heath Ledger will be missed, especially by me. Logan was fantastic, but Christopher Nolan will always have the best superhero film."
7753,True,"I think the best thing about this movie is Heath Ledger's excellent performance as the Joker; achieved that his character stood out more than any other. Then I would highlight the music, the excellent scenes of action, I would not know if the film is true to the comics or the character Batman. Leaving that last aside, it's worth seeing, a film with suspense and action in capital letters, with very good performances, as I said, good music and good effects and a script with moments that are worth it."
7754,True,"What I liked1. Heath Ledger as the Joker really did a great job on the role, no denying that2. Bruce and Alfred's connection was as good as ever3. Gordon actually felt like he had a purpose in this movie, unlike the sequel4. The action was quite amazing to watch and is to this day nine years laterWhat I didn't like1. The final act was frankly un needed2. It is impossible to watch this movie without thinking about Ledger's death3. Rachel Dawes was just as bad and un needed in this one as the first one. OverallA seven out of ten. It is a good movie and one of the better Batman movies, probably the third best. But in comparison to the first one in this series, it lacks. But in comparison to the sequel, this truly is a masterpiece next to that."
7755,True,"Personally this was one of the best movies I've seen of the last trilogy of Batman, mainly by the clean performance of Bale, I love it from beginning to end and when I have the opportunity I see it again. I am fascinated by the scene in which the suit is armed and appears with the car, it is amazing and fascinating. I think there must be another opportunity for Bale in a sequel"
7756,True,"Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace. Heath Ledger"
7757,True,"This is the BEST comic book movie I've ever seen, hands down! Chris Nolan assembled a stellar cast for his second Batman installment and it shows in the convincing portrayals of the characters. Everyone from Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal... all embrace their roles and the late Heath Ledger delivers a performance for the ages! The pacing is excellent, with Nolan turning up the intensity as the movie progresses. The tension between Bale's Batman and Ledger's Joker is exploited beautifully, as the former copes with his personal ethics and the latter constantly tests him. Aaron Eckhart's Two Face is a tragic figure who emerges as a consequence of this battle of wits and wills between the two main antagonists. This movie tends to be dark and asks the viewer to accept moral dilemmas; is it right to do what is considered wrong for the better good? A mesmerizing film of this genre and a must see for any fans or even non-fans. A masterpiece! Christopher Nolan genius."
7758,True,"This movie is one of the best I've ever seen, I love the way Christian Bale plays Batman and the scenes where the joker appears are the most entertaining of the movie.I recommend this movie a lot, because Christopher Nolan did a great job."
7759,True,The Dark Knight was an amazing film but not as good as Batman Begins. I will be honest though I found this movie very memorable compared to the other two. The best scene was when Batman was interrogating The Joker and when the Joker kept on making stories about how he got his scars. RIP Heath Ledger you were the best Joker in this film. I also liked Two Face in the movie and Batman's voice was very booming in this movie.
7760,True,I'm a huge fan of The Joker and if there is more than a 10! I will give it to this movie. Heath Ledger made an outstanding performance. May the god rest his soul in peace. Also the story line is amazing most of the movies I watched I got bored in some scenes but this one! every second is an excitement.
7761,True,"Christopher Nolan offers an incredible and unique view into Gotham City, with the utter chaos of the Joker and incredible will of his Batman. Nolan shows that the Joker can control Batman and display his weaknesses or 'true colors'. Nolan's direction of the film is outstanding with an incredible opening sequence. The Dark Knight is hands down the best Batman film of all time. Simply outstanding."
7762,True,"I'm a Big Fan of Batman. So I really thankful to the Christopher Nolan Director of this Movie (The Dark night). In this Movie Batman has One of the Best Actor & Role Played by Christian Bale Playing the Role of batman character. It was really difficult than the other characters. Batman lives in dark, was Born in Dark, always seen in Dark, Fought in Dark, Help in Dark & invisible in Dark. Dark & Darkness is real & So the Name of Dark Night is a best Choice for this Movie but a little disappointment with CGI & Action is seen in this Movie otherwise The Dark Night is an Awesome Movie to Watch. I Really Loved the Background Music of (The Dark Night). Hope I'll make a Batman Movie One Day."
7763,True,"A billionaire socialite who dedicates himself to protecting Gotham City from its criminal underworld as a bat-masked vigilante hailed as its ""Dark Knight"" at night. Bale said he was confident in his choice to return in the role because of the positive response to his portrayal in Batman Begins.12 He continued training in the Keysi Fighting Method and performed many of his own stunts,12,13 but did not gain as much muscle as in the previous film because the new Batsuit allowed him to move with greater agility.14 Bale described Batman's dilemma as whether "" something that has an end. Can he quit and have an ordinary life? The kind of manic intensity someone has to have to maintain the passion and the anger that they felt as a child, takes an effort after a while, to keep doing that. At some point, you have to exorcise your demons.""15 He added, ""Now you have not just a young man in pain attempting to find some kind of an answer, you have somebody who actually has power, who is burdened by that power, and is having to recognize the difference between attaining that power and holding on to it.""16 Bale felt Batman's personality had been strongly established in the first film, so it was unlikely his character would be overshadowed by the villains, stating: ""I have no problem with competing with someone else. And that's going to make a better movie."
7764,True,"nice movie this movie Right in the first half, one wonders why there are so many story situations cropping up that don't hint any value addition to the overall Visually arresting worlds, colorful characters and stunning action come at the expense of dead brain nice movie this movie Right in the first half, one wonders why there are so many story situations cropping up that don't hint any value addition to the overall Visually arresting worlds, colorful characters and stunning action come at the expense of dead brain"
7765,True,"*** This review may contain spoilers *** Heath, as The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great."
7766,True,"The Dark Knight was a fantastic movie and had some very good casting for some very specific roles in the movie. The role of The Joker played by Heath Ledger was the perfect example of how well the casting was for this movie. I went back and researched the ways he went about preparing himself for this role and it was unbelievable, but also very unfortunate to see what happened after the fact. The movie was great and as all batman movies go you see Batman going through the struggle of good versus evil. The Joker proves time and time again also that he doesn't care who he hurts and whether he dies or not. One example of this would be when they are fighting on the top of the unfinished skyscraper and he is pushed off the side by Batman and you see him falling to his death and just laughing as hard as he can. The obvious choice for another place that you may have seen a scenario like this would be the Dark Knight Rises, with Bane and how fearless he is and he isn't going to stop until he gets rid of Batman. But as you all know Batman would eventually go on to save The Joker but this just shows how fearless he really is and also the lighting they use from the hovering helicopter makes for a pretty memorable shot.When it comes to action movies now I feel that they are always trying to use too many explosions. I feel that was an area that the crew did a very good job of keeping these very limited throughout the movie. Also, I remember seeing this movie in theaters when it first came out and I remember it not being too loud. Which is another downfall to the newer batch of action movies. Overall, I do believe this movie is truly a 10 out of 10, going down the line there is only one thing that bugged me out of the whole movie and it was the fact that you never got to see the Joker again or even really hear about his whereabouts. I know this is more about possibly setting up the story for further down the line but I was ready to see him be finished off by someone or at least see that he made it to the Asylum. But the acting in the Dark Knight was phenomenal and they did a very good job of being able to improve on a movie from such a long time ago which now is very hard to do."
7767,True,It was an amazing film. Joker (Heath Ledger) was amazing. And Two-Face was very cool.It is by far my favourite super hero movie of all time. There is loads of action and violence. I think it would be suitable for kids aged 9 and over if you don't mind violence or mild swearing!!!! I highly recommend you watch it 10/10!!!!!! :)
7768,True,"One of the finest films I have seen and watched this movie repeatedly and without any boredom This is one of the greatest films of the present century and I have never seen another film of the same level A tribute to the director, writer, Nolan and the wonderful actors and wish them more"
7769,True,"The oldest story in existence is that of good vs evil. Audiences to the story identify with the force of good which is only natural; the narrative practically always follows the ""good guy"" and people prefer to think of themselves as being inherently good. ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) explores the dichotomy of good and evil by keeping the traditional narrative, but challenging the way in which audiences identify with certain themes.For as long as Batman and the Joker have been at odds, Batman has always represented truth, justice, and the force of good while the Joker has been an advocate for chaos and self-indulgent depravity. The two characters' motivations for their respective behaviors had always been overlooked by audiences until the release of ""Batman: The Killing Joke"" in 1988. In The Killing Joke, the Joker's origin story is revealed and he divulges that he commits atrocities to prove that deep down, everyone (even Batman) is just as immoral as he is, proclaiming that ""all it takes is one bad day.""In The Dark Knight, the Joker sets out to prove that very same argument, which culminates with his plan involving the two ferries. Before the Joker's plan fails to come to fruition, audiences assume that Batman intends to prove that people are inherently good, but as the film nears its end, it becomes apparent that the true moral of the story is that people choose whether to be good or evil, something the Joker had anticipated and abused. The Joker takes advantage of Harvey Dent's grievous situation as his ""ace in the hole,"" with hopes that the people of Gotham will become disheartened after seeing the most noble of people turned evil. In the end, to keep the Joker from winning over the minds of the people, Batman ascribes Dent's misdeeds to his own reputation to save Dent's, giving the people of Gotham an idol to rally behind. Overall, the film's production, acting, and effects work in perfect rapport with its themes and narrative to achieve a perfect 10 in my opinion."
7770,True,"A lot of people have fallen in love with this movie and for good reason. It is everything good about superhero movies and why people love them so much. You would think with how many people fanboy about this movie it might be over-hyped but it's really not. It's everything everyone says and then some. I do like to think that it is a perfect movie though because no movie is. But one of the only real flaws I could find was that I cared more for the villain than the hero. But that is not a real flaw. A real flaw is it is not for all viewers. Sometimes it can be a bit boring if you're only into big action movies. but that's nitpicking, in reality, It's a fun movie that if you have not seen yet you should try it out."
7771,True,"Best batman movie ever!The actors are great! Exclusevely Christian Bale and Heath Ledger. Another great job of Christopher Nolan. The action scenes are perfectly done and the talk scenes are excellent. If its not the best batman movie of all history, its one of the best. Great job DC and Warner Bros"
7772,True,"This is one of if not the best movie I have ever seen. The acting is great, the story is enthralling, and the effects are breathtaking. The Joker was an amazing villain very creepy and menacing the fall of Harvey Dent leaves an impression on you if you've never read about or heard about him. The great thing about this movie is that it wasn't afraid to end on a darker note with the villain winning and the hero going into hiding. Amazing"
7773,True,"The to this day by far the best Batman film. Nolan has already set a masterpiece of his own with the second part of the trilogy. Not only the plot is, or the script itself is exhilarating. But what one should not underline is the performance of Batman himself, and the Joker. The latter is for me personally the best joker ever. He has thus also left a genuine mark to all the following joker actors."
7774,True,"i like the way they made the joker look so much scarier,funnier,and a lot more dangerous.batman is a lot more bared blacker faster stronger too a lot more. and his bat plane is a lot more bigger faster too but it has a lot more weapons too. the bat mobile is a whole much more faster than the bat jet.the bat bike is a lot the bat mobile its the same speed has more weapons too."
7775,True,"All the hailing of Ledger's performance are grounded. Watching it will make you feel a different chill down your spine than you'd remember from any other film. It's impossible, quite literally to relate to The Joker. He gets inside your head with his stories of how he got his scars, makes you laugh at his sick jokes, then makes you instantly wonder why you're laughing."
7776,True,"Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman."
7777,True,"The Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, The Godfather, they're all great films. Largely excepted to be one of the greatest films of all time, and The Dark Knight belongs right there with them. The Dark Knight trilogy as a whole is untouched by the marvel cinematic universe, and The Dark Knight is the untouched movie in the trilogy. This is a superhero movie that redefined Batman and the genre. Personally, growing up watching Batman, I've always wanted a more realistic one compared to Tim Burton's. This was a superhero genre, along with crime and drama. We see the fall of Harvey Dent, and a man who has no care of the world other than to watch it burn. You clearly see the inspirations from the graphic novels like, ""The Long Halloween,"" ""Dark Victory,"" and of course, ""The Killing Joke."" The irony of Gotham's true hero, Harvey Dent, lived long enough to see himself become the villain. The joker, he pushed everyone to their limits, he wanted to make everyone have just ""one bad day"" like the Joker in the graphic novel, ""The Killing Joke."" It is a story of Shakespearean proportion. To those who rate this movie a criminally underrated 1-7, are just joking yourself and clearly trying to die down the hype. Take a rain check, nine years later this movie still best the super hero genre, and it's simply because it is more complex than the genre itself. That is why it belongs as one of the best films ever made. Also, if you're still confused, and argue that Iron Man is better than the Dark Knight because they both have 94% on rotten tomatoes, look more closely. It's average rating is a 7.7/10, while The Dark Knight's average rating of 8.6/10 on rotten tomatoes. Not even The Avengers came close to besting, ""The Dark Knight."" Deny it all you want, to this day, ""The Dark Knight"" is a film that is in a league of its own."
7778,True,Christopher Nolan create comic book world in an amazing way and his Choices for the casting was brilliant like Christian Bale & the amazing Heath Ledger & Michael Caine & Maggie Gyllenhaal & Gary Oldman & Morgan Freeman and the legendary performance form heath ledger and Directing made this movie Should never be forgotten and all the Characters made up perfectly Especially the joker will always be unforgotten Michael Caine also made his Character more convincing and his performance was very good and Christian Bale was also very good Heath Ledger as the joker is best villain in the comic book movie ever and no one will ever made this Character as he did it the script was was very amazing really one the best ever written Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan for the (screenplay) well done and this movie for batman was the best for this Character by far a lot of emotions in this movie for Bruce Wayne and his Character without the mask the opening scene is one of the best ever made is so amazing i've never seen any thing like this before
7779,True,"First, Heath Ledger, rest in peace, was hilarious as the Joker. I can't be the only one who laughs at the Joker. However, I was not a fan of Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman. Alfred was played well, and Morgan Freeman made an enjoyable Lucius Fox. On the whole though, the acting was okay. And though I knew the move was three hours when I began, I sort of forgot and when I got to the seeming end with the Joker being captured, I was like, ""Alright, this was lame."" But the second half made it worth watching, though the mediocre acting and other negatives made is OKAY on the whole. Entertaining, but lacking in something. I think Batman's tools were too modern and made from outside. I think they should be a mix between the classic and modern technology. Batman is a genius. I understand Fox finances, but it's like he is the brains while Batman is the playboy muscle. Also that. Batman can be a lady's man without being a flat, intelligent, but not so morally deep character. The depth of Batman's foundations are not shown here, and he is more muscle and penis than anything. The positives, other than the Joker and pleasant Morgan Freeman are lacking IMO. I really did enjoy this movie though, mostly because I have been watching Gotham and have wanted to watch Batman. The movie also has a bit of a badly moving storyline. I know this review sounds contradicting, but it just lacked in too many areas to give is an 8, and so its a 7 for me. Not a flop, but Bale makes a shallow, dumbed down, muscle man that requires Fox to hold his moral fiber together, as shown in the triangulating scene where Fox is outraged at the immorality of tapping phones."
7780,True,"Well.........where do I begin? I have no idea.Heath Ledger, given an award after he died. The man was a drug addict and simply went too far. Not such a great performance in the film actually. Mediocre. But because he went tits up, his role was portrayed as one of the greatest ever. Nonsense. Like I said. Mediocre.As far as Batman is concerned, he definitely needs some throat lozenges. What a crock with that voice they had him use.It was less than halfway through when I lost all interest and forgot what the plot was. If there was one. The only reason I saw the ending credits was simply because of the fact that I needed some background noise for the evening.You want some real Batman! Watch the 60's TV show. Campy...yes. Phony...yes. Utterly ridiculous...yes. But, it was Batman and enjoyable.In one sentence.......""the worst ever""......."
7781,True,"After seeing ""The Dark Knight,"" I left the theater disturbed and even a bit depressed. Because of that, I cannot understand the large mass of hysteria that surrounds this film. It's really not all bad. There are great action scenes (such as one with Batman escaping a building by attaching to a plane and flying away), as well as some good moral choices made by some characters (such as the passengers on two boats deciding not to destroy each other when the Joker threatens to blow they both up if they do not). Christian Bale plays Batman/Bruce Wayne very well once again, and my favorite supporting actor from ""Batman Begins,"" Morgan Freeman, is also excellent. I found much of the film disturbing, however. The Joker (Heath Ledger) was just plain bad. It's really not a good performance, a bit too put on and exaggerated, and I don't feel Ledger did as well as everyone claims. The site of Two-Face after the incident that burned him was extremely disturbing, and I still cannot get that image out of my mind. I'm still giving it a fair rating, because the action scenes and some of the characters are somewhat interesting, but it's far below the last film for me. Do not take the kids to this one. You won't want them to witness this film. For mature viewers, still take caution, and you may enjoy some of it.*** out of ****"
7782,True,"THE DARK KNIGHT (2008) **** Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Eric Roberts, Monique Curnen, Nestor Carbonell, Anthony Michael Hall, William Fichtner, Cillian Murphy, Nicky Katt, Tiny Lister. Filmmaker Christopher Nolan's fantastic interpretation/adaptation of Bob Kane's seminal comic book hero continues its flights of fancy in this amazingly realized sequel incorporating the very dark, dank images of Frank Miller's 1986 take on the eponymous avenger with a tormented Bruce Wayne/Batman (brooding, intensely conflicted Bale continuing to deliver the goods mixing courage and vulnerability and an Eastwoodian rasp as The Caped Crusader) facing many obstacles, namely his boyhood crush/best friend ADA Rachel Dawes (loosey-goosey, unconventional beauty Gyllenhaal, replacing the lush Katie Holmes, and adding some brainy feist) is now hooking up with Gotham's golden boy ""white knight"" politico/DA Harvey Dent (Eckhart exuding Kennedy charisma to boot) making waves by gunning after a new threat to the fair city: The Joker (the late, stunningly great Ledger in sadly his last completed starring role; a towering, staggering achievement here rivaling Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal ""the Cannibal"" Lecter in a truly unnerving, creepy villainous turn to last for the ages), a homicidal harlequin, whose terror-inducing anarchy sets the stage for apocalyptic mayhem. Nolan  who co-wrote with his brother Jonathan and David S. Goyer- hatches a decent plot line paralleling the dual dichotomies of his hero and villain both 'freaks' whose psyches are severely hot-wired and ready for action. Ably supported by most of the returning cast from ""BATMAN BEGINS"" : Caine as manservant/nurse-maid Alfred the Butler continues to be the storyline's underscored conscience; Oldman as Lt. James Gordon the only honest man left in a corrupt city; Foreman as the ""Q"" to Wayne's Bond has a foxy-loxy air about him; and Roberts handles oily menace as a tough gangster getting in everyone's way. Kudos to the spectacular lensing by Nolan's frequent collaborator the unheralded Wally Pfister; Nathan Crowley's splendid transformation of Chicago into Gotham City and overall production design; John Caglione's amazing make-up inspirations  particularly Dent's tragic ""Two-Face"" concoction; and the pulsing, throbbing, murkily propulsive score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard.But the true price of admission is Ledger's feckless, gleefully anarchic virtuoso turn as The Joker, with his sloppily slathered on greasepaint and odd Chicagoan accent (it sounds eerily like Dan Aykroyd in ""DR. DETROIT""!), herky-jerky movements, slippery tongue flicking like a louche lizard and a cross between a possessed ventriloquist puppet and Jim Morrison  a resuscitated corpse come to life  is the legendary stuff made especially for cinematic time capsules and a much deserved (posthumously so) Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor. Ledger nails it perfectly so; a thing of rapacious beauty with dank élan. The film itself deserves many Academy notices including Picture, Director, Make-up and Screenplay to name several; it'd be foolish if it weren't. One of the year's very best films and perhaps one of the best sequels to a franchise."
7783,True,"When I first saw the online trailer of The Dark Knight, my wife said ""so do you reckon the movie would be that good, the man bettering Jack N's Joker, or its just a well made trailer trying to cash in on Ledger's legacy?"" Not really a fanboy, I just ignored the question shrugging my shoulders.I am glad to say that now, I can answer the questions in a major affirmative: yes, the movie is that good; Heath Ledger makes Jackie boy's portrayal campy. And thank God that for once the hype created for a superhero movie by Warner Bros. doesn't just live up to it, but far exceeds it! What does this review have new to offer? Nothing really. Just that I had forgotten to post it on IMDb when the movie had come out, so finishing off my to-do list!!!One wishes that there be a spin-off graphic novels based on The Dark Knight, not the other way around; its far superior to 'The Killing Joke' and 'Death in the Family'. For Gotham looks and feels like a real city, with real people and real emotions. This is a complete movie and you start feeling for the characters, you wait with baited breathe for your hero to succeed and you don't ridicule the villain, nor do you empathise with him: quite simply, you're very scared of him. You shiver every time he says ""WHY SO SERIOUS! "" The plot is fairly straight forward and perhapssplashed all over the internet. Here's a quick recap: The last good cop Lieutenant Gordon and Batman, assisted by his Man Friday Alfred and able brain man Luscious Fox are on a cleaning spree, joined by the new District Attorney Harvey Dent (who is, btw, dating Bruce Wayne's ex-flame Rachel Dawes) and whilst all the bad boys are being put in jail, the Joker makes an offer to the underworld to kill Batman. Quite simply, he won't do something that has a price for free. People die, Batman's insecurity and vulnerability is brought to the fore, the Joker bleeds yet laughs; and as our hero undergoes it all, we hope and pray that the movie never comes to an end! Late Heath Ledger is simply outstanding as the Joker. He's eight steps ahead of everyone-including the trying-to-workout-the-plot-smarty audience. There is no denial that he deserves an Oscar nod, and if posthumous Knighthoods are bestowed, sign me up for the petition to get him one. He's crazy, psychotic, calculating, and makes the audience think forever as to what is up his sleeve. His portrayal instills fear even with a pencil! At the expense of probably being the one-billionth person saying it, Heath Ledger's Joker surpasses all hype & expectations, is way better than Jack Nicholson's take on the same character and makes the world realize what a great actor we've lost.It's hard to put the rest of the cast in the same level as Ledger, but everyone does brilliantly. Had this been any other movie, probably right now everyone would be rooting for Christian Bale and Gary Oldman's magic on screen. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Maggie Gyllenhall are so perfect that you possibly can't imagine other actors playing these characters. Aaron Eckhart is efficient, but just leaves the audience a little wishing-for-more from Harvey Dent/Two Face. One wonders if Good Will Hunting Matt Damon would've scored the areas that Eckhart missed on.If there is one person who matches Heath Ledger here is the Director Chris Nolan. Take a bow, Chris, as you have truly created a masterpiece, without compromising on the comic book charm or the tragic hero pathos, or the twists and thrills we have known and loved you for. Thank you for rescuing Batman, and giving the movie colour you did! Please don't stop here, and we look forward to your final instalment in this trilogy All in all, it's a wonderful movie. A movie that deserves respect and admiration, more importantly repeat viewing to fully appreciate the little tricks that Nolan has left.As I sign off, once more, my salutes to Heath Ledger, the actor, who's swansong is this magnum opus, and May You Rest in Peace, Sir Heath!"
7784,True,"This is a good film. It's a good action film and it's a pretty good adaptation of some stories from the Batman stories.This isn't the best film ever, it's not the most amazing film ever. It is very enjoyable. There are things that raise a smile, things that will shock and surprise you. All in all, it's worth it's rating. Films are not all about deep philosophical debates, they are simply there to entertain and this film does just that.Lots of the negative reviews point out plot holes, wooden acting and start getting in to a discussion about if this should be taken seriously or not. I ask those people...Why so serious? This film isn't asking to be taken as a picture of real life and the eternal struggles that we encounter in our normal life of working in an office or whatever it is we do when not at the cinema.At simplest it's a battle between good and evil. The hero is a dark brooding figure that installs fear in to the criminal underworld. His alter ego (which is even more of a mask) is a playboy millionaire that struggles with who he really is. Other good characters are the decent cop surrounded by corrupt ones, just trying to do the decent thing and then the whiter than white politician whose determined to rid us of the evil that lurks on our streets.Then you get evil personified in the Joker. When they do these surveys of the best baddie, this character will be there. The Joker uses peoples fear and greed to manipulate them. His aim is to create chaos and anarchy just for the fun of it. He plants bombs not to simply kill but to bring out the killer in others. Whilst the good guys are cleaning up the evil in the gutter, the Joker is trying to entice it from everyone. Some men just want to watch the world burn.So is the film too long, for some yes but it was fine for me, there was enough pace to keep it moving and enough dialog to keep it interesting.For some of the main critisisms I've read through I have to ask, Why So Serious? Trying to over analyse some of the events in a film like Batman is a little daft, it's about a guy that dresses up in a suit and beats up bad guys on a summers night whilst playing with girls on boats in the day...hardly a realistic base for a story now...If I want philosophy I'll read a book written by a philosopher, if I want to be entertained, I go to the movies. If you want deep & meaningful, save your cash for a movie ticket, buy some classic books and when your bored of that pop this in to your DVD player for some fun."
7785,True,"So We Have Here THE DARK KNIGHT, The Recent Installment To The New Batman Franchise and This Movie Got It Right. I Liked The How The Joker Was Portrayed as a Cruel-Non Remorse Killer Out To Shake Things Up In Gotham. However, Heath Ledger Didn't Do A 100% Job As The Menacing Joker. The Tagline ""WHY SO SERIOUS!!!?"" Really Did Send Chills As Ledger Would Say It, But The Different Stories He Would Say To Accompany His Scars Were Totally Pointless. The Performance From Morgan Freeman As Bruce Wayne's Friend Did Put Interest In This Movie With All The New Devices and Means To His Acting. Christian Bale As The Dark Knight Himself Proves To Be Supreme Actor and Makes This Role His Own. Overall, Supreme To All Batman Movies With All Respect, But The Hype For Heath Ledger Not Too Hyped Up Here.9/10"
7786,True,"All in all The Dark Knight was way better then I had hoped to be. Health Ledger's performance was just AMAZING!! He deserves a Oscar for that IMO. I could watch this movie over and over and still love it. The storyline, the drama, the action, all of it was truly amazing.This movie truly depicts who Batman really is, a Dark Knight. Two-Face was scary to with that face. Now I expected the Joker to personally do the damage but still I liked how it was handled none the less. I was surprised when Rachel died in that explosion, tragic and sad. I felt bad for Bruce Wayne, losing someone he cares about.Also I forgot to mention some of the lines the Joker made were hilarious and yet scary.I loved Harvey's quotes in the movie. It is a shame he turned bad, he was a good speaker. Alfred was a very good cheer up person for Bruce. Heck I would of given up if that happened to me.100/10 stars :D"
7787,True,"All of the praise for this movie is well founded and I enjoyed it very much. The Joker, in summation, was maniacal! Ledger's performance was the best part of this film. I won't waste your time praising this movie anymore because I'm sure it's all been said before. I would like to talk about two flaws in this movie that I noticed during my first viewing that, in my eyes, keep this film from perfection and should, in the end, keep this movie from at least the top three spots on IMDb's top 250 if not the top ten.The Flaws 1) Two Face - In the comics and even the animated series Two Face/Harvey Dent was a man struggling internally with good and evil, the duality of man. His coin was a symbol of the two different paths a person can take, the high road of righteousness and proper justice or the low road of anger and revenge. In The Dark Knight Harvey Dent/Two Face was just a crazy villain who was turned entirely evil by the Joker leaving behind the morals of Harvey Dent. Two Face was degraded into a silly villain bent on dealing out ""chance"" with his coin because no part of him believes in justice. Basically the coin should represent the internal struggle in Harvey Dent between good an evil. The coin should not represent chance as the only real ""justice"" in the world. The end result is the same but the reasons are very different.2) The Ferry Dilemma - I didn't like this scene because it is the only scene in the movie which portrays human nature as righteous and intelligent. 15 minutes before this scene all of Gotham was attempting to kill the man who was about the reveal the Batman's identity. Now these same citizens are on a ferry with their own lives at stake and the don't push the button to kill the others and save themselves? Not consistent at all. Throughout the entire movie people are portrayed as unintelligent and cowardly except for that one scene on the ferry. My complaint isn't in any scene individually per say, the problem is that the movie is inconsistent in it's portrayal of the nature of man.I hope you reading this understand what I'm talking about. Thanks for reading."
7788,True,"people who does not get it or like it the dark knight maybe are not smart enough to this kind of movies.like this lines that joker say:You want to know how I got this scars? My father was a drinker and a fiend. And one night he goes off CRAZIER than usual. Mommy get's the kitchen knife to defender herself. He doesn't like that. Not, one, BIT. So, me watching, he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He turns to me and he says, ""WHY SO SERIOUS, son?"" He comes at me with the knife; ""WHY SO SERIOUS?"" He sticks the blade in my mouth, ""Let's put a smile on that face!"" Aaaaaaannnd... WHY SO SERIOUS?"
7789,True,"Good movie, but this isn't the greatest film in the universe. On the one hand, it tries very hard to show how and why these characters are motivated - this is where the crime-drama comparison comes from. The movie does this very well. But the plot is unfocused and fragmented. And the whole cell-phone thing was unforgivable. As a plot device it was on par with Independence Day's using a computer virus to stop an alien invasion.That being said, see this film if you haven't already. Take this and every other review with a grain of salt. The coolest scenes in this film were breathtaking, well worth the $10 admission."
7790,True,"The thing that impresses most throughout this film is Heath Ledger. What a tragedy! Well, at least he went out with an immortal caliber performance, his first and last. How ironic that his first role against type will be remembered as the defining role of his career! We all loved Jack back in the 90's as Joker, but this portrayal is something quite extraordinary, I must say. I was never a big fan of his, although I always liked his first big role in ""A Knight's Tale."" Once again, the irony of it all. He began and ended his major roles with ""Knight"" movies. Also ironic that Joker dies in the Tim Burton version, but here he survives. I really liked the chaotic character of this Joker. He has no back-story, no consistent explanation for why he exists or why he does things. In short, he is ""The Joker"". Even the darkest realities are just another joke to him. Crime is all about having fun at everyone else's expense. For you D&D fans out there, he is the embodiment of chaotic evil. The apotheosis of the Norse god Loki. He confuses and confounds Batman, the embodiment of lawful good. Batman is all about control, rules, and justice. Joker is all about chaos, lawlessness, and anarchy.I wonder what they will do with the character in the next installment? I must say I'm NOT looking forward to Robin's introduction. Perhaps they'll just leave him out? Oh, well, enough about Joker. Let me just go on record as saying that whatever they want to give Ledger posthumously is alright with me. He rocks!I'm really sorry, but what is it with Batman's and Spiderman's girlfriends? Can't they get really attractive women to date? They did the best they could to make Maggie G. look nice, but it gets rather embarrassing when the all the protagonists begin to remark on her, ahem, ""beauty?"" Give me a break, her face looks like an old sack, even with all the makeup! I was relieved that Joker blew her up. Not because I wish her ill, but just because I'm tired of looking at her! Perhaps someone on the Marvel side can do Spidey (and me) the same kind of favor with MJ?I liked just about everything else about this film, though. Technically, dramatically, dialog, editing, and on and on. Just see it. It is what it is. Don't expect it to reverse global warming, end the war in Iraq, or make gasoline prices plummet just enjoy it for the fun, exciting movie that it is."
7791,True,"The Dark Knight is the follow up to Batman Begins, and was a well anticipated film. And guess what? It lived up to its standards.A lot has improved from Batman Begins and it was a lot better too. The plot revolves around Batman still being the vigilante of Gotham, but is now more excepted. He is now teamed up with Gordon and new district attorney Harvey Dent to crack down on crime and put all the bad guys behind bars. However, there is one maniac on the loose who totally is ruling the heroes - The Joker! Manipulative, cunning, terrifying and a real basket case, the Joker brings Gotham to its knees. Things get worse when the loss of a loved one (not saying who), results in Dent getting scarred quite brutally on one side of his face and he becomes Two-Face, going on a rampage across Gotham killing all those involved with his tragedy.Christian Bale improves his role as Batman and Bruce Wayne, particularly as Bruce. Batman still needs some work and must ditch that gravely voice. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman return as Alfred, Lucius Fox and Commissioner Gordon and they all are brilliant. I still do not care for Rachel Dawes. My main interest in this film was the portrayal of the villains.Scarecrow showed up for about five minutes and his role was generally pointless. Sal Maroni was introduced and his portrayal was very enjoyable to watch. Two-Face was played by Aaron Eckart who was completely different to how Tommy Lee Jones handled the character. He was very emotional before and after the transformation into a villain. His scarred face was very realistic, done through CGI.But the main attraction was the late Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Prince Clown of Crime. Just as Jim Carrey playing the Riddler in Batman Forever ruled that film, Ledger ruled the Dark Knight as Joker. The interesting thing about this Joker, is that he was portrayed as a true homicidal maniac, using knifes and guns to kill instead of using zany weapons like previous versions did. He was terrifically maniacal in his own way and each line he says is a laugh riot. I give an applause to Mr. Ledger for his take on the Joker.A notable absence is the Batcave and a warehouse is used instead. Aside from the Joker, the introduction of the Batpod (a motorbike) was excellent. The best moment involves a truck driven by the Joker flipping over and than Batman nearly drives the Batpod up a wall.To parents, the film has a lot of violence, death, dark moments and a lot of scenes that may be unsuitable for children. However, it is an excellent film."
7792,True,"Batman, the dark night has to be one of the best super hero movies ever!When they chose to call it the dark night we can see why. Filled with dark cinematography throughout, there is a judgement day like cloud hung over Gotham city. Wonderfully written so technically clever and all the big guns did not disappoint, Cane, Freeman, Bale, but the winner has to be Heath Ledger. His camp, psychotic portrayal of the joker is in complete contrast to other roles he has played and although you want to desperately repulse him he is really likable. If Ledger does not win an Oscar for this the academy need to be slapped silly. Truly wonderful."
7793,True,"I saw Batman begins in the theatre back in 2005 and was astonished at how much enjoyment I had with the experience. The follow up, hinted at by the revelation of the playing card at the finale being the perfect teaser for the film which followed. Experiencing this at an Imax theatre for the first time I was absolutely blown away. In almost every beautifully shot scene the audience is constantly reminded of the scale and grandeur of the city. The film has an excellently structured plot with enough twists and turns to make one completely forget the somewhat bizarre premise and every cast member invests enough energy to make the audience suspend disbelief. A special mention must go to the brilliant script, stunts and wit of some performances. It will be a miraculous achievement if Christopher Nolan can top this one. An absolute gem of a film."
7794,True,"Right, let's get the bad points out the way first. The film is thirty minutes too long and seems to be trying too hard to be about something, though it isn't quite sure what that something is. Good guys always lose? Being a good guy just isn't enough? Only good guys acting like bad guys can keep the world safe? There are also some rather dubious moral side issues slipped in here. Batman gives The Joker the ""bad cop"" treatment, and one wonders if this is intended as a justification of severe interrogation methods. The Joker is clearly depicted as an urban terrorist here, working to make everyone else like him. Ring any bells? Bush is now a footnote in history; his morally repugnant policies of torture, detention without trial, and mass murder of innocent Iraqi's whose only crime was to be ruled by a ruthless dictator will live in infamy for decades to come. This movie seems to stick up for the indefensible. You don't beat the terrorists by becoming them.The Heat influence is also rather too on the nose; moral complexity is all very well but the film never seems to decide what it's purpose is. The dirtying of the waters here - Gordon admits it's his fault Two Face has lost everything; Batman lets people die or take the rap to preserve his identity; this murkiness is all very well but makes things rather confusing instead of ""deep"".After all Batman is supposed to be a hero - sure he has a dark side, but he masters his anger and fear and does the right thing. Except in this film, where for no very good reason he winds up as a fugitive at the film's climax. Is one person really so important to the future of Gotham?However the film is still very good for all that, superbly acted, directed and with excellent set pieces. Heath Ledger really is superb as The Joker, here presented as a Bin Laden type (""some people just wanna see the world burn"") and the regular cast, Bale, Caine, Oldman and Freeman have plenty of chances to shine, Eckhart is also very good as Harvey Dent. I came out of the movie having enjoyed it, realising there was nothing in it to inspire kids into thinking that Batman is much of a hero, and believing the Two Face Stuff rather fumbled - he deserves a film all of his own. To summarise - you'll get your monies worth, but it isn't up to Christopher Nolan's first Batman Opus."
7795,True,"OK, let's be clear... so amazing! so incredible! so absolutely EXCELLENT...The problem is... (are) 1. where does he get the Psychoes to do his bidding and how do they ""stick to the plan"" if they're ""psycho""? 2. How does he get all the ""gasoline/explosive material"" EVERYWHERE w/o anyone seeing? 3. I look forward to the DVD which takes an extra hour and explains these ""faults"" so that I can say: ""This is, without a doubt, the most brilliant piece of film ever to come out of Hollywood. BRAVO!!!With all that said and ""out of the way"", I found myself enjoying this film immensely and look forward to seeing it again, in the very near future in the theaters!!!"
7796,True,"Following the events of Batman Begins, Gotham City is undergoing a crime reformation under the enthusiastic optimism of Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), the new district attorney who is more easily recognizable as a public figure for good, then Batman (Christian Bale). But as events seem to be going right for Dent, Batman and James Gorden (Gary Oldman), they are caught off guard when an essential and psychopathic killer known as the Joker (Heath Ledger) decides to wreck havoc upon Gotham.Nolan's vision of Batman has been one which moves away from the expected superhero environment, to a context which bases itself in reality as far as possible. With The Dark Knight, Nolan goes one step further and creates a gritty crime thriller with little emphasis on the fantasy associated with comic books. In fact, this becomes one of the few problems with the film, though one which could be easily overlooked. Whereas Batman Begins attempted to keep some supernatural elements within its context, as referenced by the League of Shadows, The Dark Knight does not have any mystical nature to it, but relies on the grittiness of a contrived world. But beyond this, the story is a huge success, creating a well formed synthesis between the superhero and crime thriller genres. There's enough plot, enough characters, and enough twists to keep you guessing, and with an engaging flow, the film doesn't feel its 152 minute runtime. But this runtime is perhaps not long enough: the biggest flaw with Nolan's attempt to tell so much story is that a plot development occurs later on in the film that really never feels complete, and almost tacked on. This plot does add to the thematic approach of the film, which is one of the films greatest achievements. No longer is the viewer asked to embrace the clichéd notion of power and responsibility and instead focuses itself on ethical propositions. Moral dilemma face every character, bar the Joker, and each is forced to make decisions that go against what they believe in. It is this depth to the characters which really makes for a compelling social case study. However, as much as every scene seems to fit so nicely into the film's flow, that isn't to say that the film itself surpasses Batman Begins. Batman Begins proved to be a better balance at telling a story, whereas The Dark Knight did not. In fact, the biggest concern with The Dark Knight, is that the film ultimately feels without enough direction by the time the credits role. There is no main objective to the film, just a series of events which lead to an intriguing, though abrupt end.The level of acting ability is astonishing, equaling Batman Begins. It is very rare to see such a film receive such a great cast and each actor is used to almost full effect. Bale reprises his role as the conflicted Bruce Wayne/ Batman and does so with greater ease then before. However Bale never seems to get Batman's gruff voice entirely correct. Whereas in Begins Bale was a naturalness to the voice, it sounds as if he is forcing it in The Dark Knight. He sounds better in the latter half of the film, but regardless its a minor problem at best. Another minor problem is the complete lack of Dr. Crane/ Scarecrow. Being a interestingly developed character in the original, he is now limited to around 2 minutes in the beginning arc. It's disappointing to see a character with so much potential be marginalized as so. Another character who doesn't have his potential realized is Harvey Dent. He undergoes a great transformation, and his emotional struggle is well executed, but by the films end, this well built character suffers from underexposure or just a lack of runtime. An interesting role comes in th form of Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel. Maggie replaced Katie Holmes, who I believe wasn't all that bad but merely overshadowed by a wonderful cast. Maggie sadly doesn't fare any better: it's clear everyone else is more in their element then she is. And of course there is Ledger as the infamous Joker. Much has been said about his performance and how it is Oscar worthy. I'll say that I agree that his acting is incredible, with some intriguing nuances. Unlike the rest of the cast, Ledger is very much a lively actor expressing himself through body movements. But while I loved his role, Ledger lacks the maturity to really excel himself to the likes of Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be blood, for example. Nonetheless, not getting a lead an Oscar nod would be very much a slap in the face to an actor who was clearly beginning to peak.Besides some minor suggestive material, and exceedingly low use of language, the film does indeed sport an array of violence. This incorporates lots of hand-to-hand combat, firearm usage, some upsetting off-screen moments, and one rather violent scene involving a pencil. Its blood free but still nonetheless deliver quite an impact.Regardless of whether you you believe Spiderman, Batman Begins or the recent Iron Man to be the benchmark of superhero movies, there is no denying that The Dark Knight excels in the genre. It is an excellent example of good directing, acting and story advancement, but what makes The Dark Knight a superb superhero movie is not that it is able to recreate its comic book form so aptly, but that it makes a great cinematic piece. Whether you are a fan of superhero films or not, The Dark Knight deserves attention not only for building upon the success of Batman Begins, but for shattering the preconceptions of superheros in cinema. Does The Dark Knight surpass its former incarnation? For better or worse, both are on equal terms."
7797,True,"www.liveforfilms.com It's 11:30pm and we're just back from the super duper preview showing of The Dark Knight at the Fact in Liverpool. I'll try not to spoil things Initial thoughts  it is as good as you have heard.The Nolan brothers have struck absolute dynamite with their script. Everything about it is brilliant and they do one of the best things any writer / director can do. They don't treat the audience like kids. This is one long, twisted journey through the devastation one messed up man can do to an entire city.As they pushed Heath Ledger to market the movie so much, I'll deal with his performance first. Heath Ledger is not in this movie. He channels The Joker so all you see on screen is the maniac who tells a joke and no one laughs. Even when not on screen the Joker is there manipulating everyone and everything to show the frailty of the human spirit. When he is on screen he stalks and tumbles around everyone and you never know what will happen next. His magic trick is not one the kids will want to know.Aaron Eckhart portrays the wonderfully tragic Harvey Dent as the saviour of Gotham City. You buy into his character and see why Bruce Wayne and James Gordan believe in him. As to what happens to him, well if you are a fan of the comic you'll know his destiny, but it doesn't make it any less chilling when it happens. I would love to see Eckhart as Hal Jordon or Steve Rogers.Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are all as wonderful as they always are. We see more of Gordon's passion to save the city, learn more of Alfred's past in the British Army and see why Lucius Fox is one of Wayne's most trusted advisors.Most reviews have said this is Ledger's film and The Joker is a brilliant screen villain. Everything he should have always been is there. However, the film is called The Dark Knight for a reason.Christian Bale is the Batman and Batman is the greatest one there is. Bale fills the role of Bruce Wayne and Batman with ease. Wayne is in ascendance when he sees a chance to take off the mask when Dent cleans up the city and Bale portrays this so subtly yet so well, but Batman is always there pushing through the façade. We see more and more of the Bat as the film progresses and he is not always in costume. By the end of the movie he is pretty much all there is. You get to see Bruce Wayne's vast intellect and huge fortune at work to get things done and this is what is really good about the movie. We see the Dark Knight Detective actually do detective work to track down the mysterious Joker. He questions suspects, investigates crime scenes and uses gadgets that could exist if you were a billionaire crime fighter. Batman always has a plan and can improvise brilliantly when things are not quite what they seem.This is very much the Batman from the comics. There is a reason for the change in costume (which includes a sly dig at all previous Batman movies), we see the Batman with white eyes as in the comic and there is even a kind of mini Brother Eye that he uses to track down the Joker.The film itself is superb. Many of the effects were done on camera so there is not too much CGI to pull you out of the film. It's 152 minutes but they fly by and there is one point when you think it is near the end and you so want it to continue that when it does you have a great big smile on your face. Gotham City is not as big a character as we see in Batman Begins, but that could be due to Batman having cleaned it up some in the interim.So many good bits in the film. Batmanuel as the Mayor, the genesis of the Bat Pod (which was in the first movie), the homage to the Michael Keaton / Jack Nicholson showdown. Bruce Wayne taking down the bad guys with ease. Batman leaping into the fray and taking down a Swat team before they realise it, the return of Scarecrow, the Joker getting into people's minds and getting them to do whatever he wants. Harvey Dent flipping his lucky coin. There was one point when Batman is on top of a building listening into the phone network that you half expect Superman to land and see if he needs any help. I could go on.The bad points. Well it would have been a 10 but there are a couple of small points which jar. Not much but they are there and are mainly due to the editing. One is when Batman leaps out of the Penthouse to save Rachel he leaves the Joker with a room full of very rich hostages, yet it then cuts to a few minutes after that and nothing is mentioned as to what happened. That and the aforementioned lack of character in Gotham itself. Small points I know, but they jarred nonetheless.It richly deserves all the Oscar nominations it should get  screenplay should be the main one along with Best Director, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor for Bale and Ledger.People will ask is it a good comic book movie. Iron Man was a great comic book movie. The Dark Knight is simply a great movie. It has moved beyond the comic book movies and is standing shoulder to shoulder with the all time classics.www.liveforfilms.com"
7798,True,"The Joker was incredible. I don't say this because I was trying to savor every last line and second with Ledger but he was simply brilliant. Batman was a bad-ass but he lacked with his ""try-to-be"" tough act. Aaron Eckhardt simply sucked. His Two-Face character made Tommy Lee Jones' performance look like gold. He had no charisma for the role at all. The Harvey Dent character was decent at best. Simply put, Heath stole the 2 1/2 hour screen. FYI, the last 30 minutes really dulled out the first 2 hours.I'm giving it 9/10 based on the last half hour truly was confusing, twisting, and a let-down with the Two-Face scenes.BUT Heath was the best psychopath ever."
7799,True,"I think the problem is that the movie tried to provide a more realistic and less comic-book rendering of its characters, but couldn't escape the fact that it was still a summer popcorn comic-book blockbuster. Batman Begins did an excellent job of ""humanizing"" the Batman, IMO. In this movie, Batman was about as human as cardboard and all the efforts at humanizing the characters apparently went into the villains.Ledger's Joker had his moments although for what it may be worth I didn't feel it was the Oscar material the newsfeeds are buzzing about. It seems to me that his Joker- or at least, the movie's Joker, since I do not know how much of this is Nolan's conception- tries to both personify the ""wild card"" symbol of his name while humanizing that symbol. As someone with a high tolerance for abstraction in the cinema (and comicbooks), this dual-effort seemed to me to contradict itself at times, supplying an implicitly mundane human backstory to the villain while explicitly ""telling"" (rather than showing) the audience that this is ""The Joker"" - The Wildcard, The Reasonless Criminal, etc. While this type of juxtaposition might work, in this particular instance it seemed as though the very elements Nolan chose to de-emphasize as unnecessary backstory were the same sorts of elements which worked so well at humanizing (and making more realistic) the Batman in Batman Begins. Perhaps Ledger's genius lay in doing such a good job at intimating the Joker's ""humanity"" in spite of this.With Harvey Dent, we are presumably supposed to be disturbed by his moral decline, but this seemed rendered moot by the apparent moral superiority displayed by Gotham's citizenry at the end of the movie in itself deserving of a WTF? The people clearly don't need Dent as a shining beacon and Batman and Gordon may as well pack up and go home in this new City of Light that is Gotham. In Burton's Gotham the citizens scrambled over each other to pick up the Joker's dollar bills. In the Dark Knight, the Joker doesn't need dollar bills (as he makes abundantly clear) and they probably wouldn't do him any good anyhow. Instead of a criminal mastermind, the Clown Prince of Crime, he is the next step in the evolution of Gotham's criminal psyche, a surfer on a wave, his henchmen motivated not by money or fear or greed but by a primal awe and respect. Yet his progression is not linear, he is not merely the most evolved of the criminals, nor merely a psychopath, but a psychopath and criminal, combining to form something new to both these classes, presumably, in Gotham. Which sort of negates the premise of a city which required a Dark Knight to begin with, one which prior to the Joker contained moral citizens and orderly, predictable criminals.Nolan seems to have separated Gotham from context in his Batman universe, to the point where, in the Dark Knight, Gotham itself is thrown away, ignored like a piece of ligament cut from meat. And yet, the context which creates the Batman, the Joker, Two-Face, and all Gotham's denizens is elevated to a position of primacy at odds with this slight. This is a character-driven Batman world with no room, it seems, for the atmosphere so richly captured by previous incarnations. The main characters arise in a generic every-city which provides nothing unavailable outside the Gotham of legend, and the viewer can only identify the characters inasmuch as they reflect off of each other. Chaos is juxtaposed against order in this Batman far more than good against evil.Whether this ""works"" is up to the viewer, but personally, again, I like a bit of symbolism and I have no problems seeing the old-school Gotham City as a close reflection of the world I live in- and as a result kind of miss the atmosphere evoked in previous movies by its Gothamized depiction. (Maybe it helps I live in NYC. One can't help but feel that this movie may have been an attempt in some ways to ""globalize"" the franchise ) I feel I need to re-view the movie, solely to further examine Ledger's Joker. I may be missing something, confusing a contradiction with a contrast or not getting the ""point"" (or rather, pointlessness) of his crimes . This is definitely to Ledger's credit, that his character was so complex, and his performance was the hilight of the film. But its also because I grew pretty bored of the confusing and lacklustre action sequences which took up so much space between Joker appearances and as a result wasn't paying as close attention as I should have been each time there was some Joker or Joker-related dialogue.So, perhaps some of Ledger's moments aside, there was only one really, truly dark thing about the film and that was the cinematography, which made fight scenes look blurry and hard to follow, and seemed like a cheap way of ""rectifying"" problem number 1, above, by providing some kind of presumably ""gothic"" look to the city (at least during night-time.) All in all, 2 hours of generic action fare which failed to live up to either the movie's hype or its predecessor, interspersed with about half an hour's worth of a decent and worthy performance by one actor. And also, the Watchmen preview."
7800,True,"Without a doubt, this is the best superhero movie ever made. It can and should be the movie by which all other superhero films are judged.The movie succeeds because it is beautifully shot, because the characters are all life-like (which is astonishing, as this is a superhero film after all!), and because of Heath Ledger's performance as the joker.Wally Pfister (The Prestige, Batman Begins, Memento) is this movie's cinematographer, and he succeeds in immersing the viewer in Gotham. In none of the other Batman movies did Gotham seem like a real city. In The Dark Knight, Gotham resembles New York City (even though it was shot in Chicago), as it does in the comics. Batman was conceived as a dark character, and Pfister and Nolan shoot him in the dark, always in the shadows, or near them.Heath Ledger is haunting and unforgettable. He deserves at the very least an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of The Joker. He is cruel, vindictive, and very, very smart. He dives into people's minds and turns them inside out, like Hannibal Lecter, and this makes his scene with Batman while he is in custody the very best in the movie. Like Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs, Ledger's screen time in The Dark Knight is limited, leaving us clamoring for more of him. All the performances are strong, but Ledger gives us a genuinely disturbed and petrifying display.It is not perfect. The third act flattens out toward the end as the next movie is set up, and James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer disappoint with another weak score. But it is a classic superhero movie, and a great movie period. I hope it grosses a billion dollars."
7801,True,"First of all, why are so many people who like the movie voting 1 star. Is it lying or are you just sad that finally something has surpassed the godfather? It just makes my day that in spite of all of the people voting 1, TDK is at 9.7 and holding steady. I've read through the hater comments and noticed they all have one thing in common. No logic (by the way if you really didn't like this movie and have legitimate points to back up your position, I have no problem)I read one review where someone said they hated the movie because the joker licked his lips to loudly and frequently. It may just be me, but that's not a legitimate reason to hate a movie.Also, someone mentioned the conspicuous lack of bats in TDK. I agree. Bats add to Batman's mystique and fear factor, and I really liked the scene in Batman Begins where he escapes from the building in a cloud of bats. This, however, is still not grounds for giving the movie a 1.The last thing I want to address is plot. There has been a litany of whining about plot holes. Just read any one of many positive reviews, and it will explain all of your memory discrepancies. I think the main reasons that people think there are plot holes are because they don't know how to pay attention and listen. IF ANYONE ELSE THINKS TDK HAS PLOT HOLES I WILL BE HAPPY TO TELL YOU HOW ADD YOU ARE."
7802,True,"I watched Batman this last week with my husband. I will start by saying I am not a fan of Christian Bale at all but he was very suited in his role as Batman and very convincing. The cast was in general, very well picked and very suited for their roles. Aaron Echhart was amazing and Heath Ledger was absolutely Oscar material in his role as the Joker!!As I was watching the film, I grew uneasy though. The ""darkness"" of the film was overwhelming at times and at 2 1/2 hrs long after a while I was looking at my watch begging there would be no more. The film was GOOD, but I found myself holding my breath far too many times, cringing far too many times and agonizing far too many times for me to say I had fun. I left the cinema with a very heavy heart and rather depressed to be honest. The Joker kept outsmarting the Batman and when he didn't it happened in a ridiculous way and I was like ""that was all?!""The film had too many high points in the plot to be honest. It felt as if was caught in a rough sea which was fun for a while but the waves kept coming and coming and coming and coming.... and coming... with no end until it was not fun anymore. After the 2 hrs mark I just wanted the film over already. Just grab the Joker and kill him and be done with it, let's go home!! There was also too much information in this film. They could have made TWO films out of it easily. Seriously! Things kept happening and happening and happening and happening some more... too many locations, too many characters, the film was bustling with them, too many stories, plots and us agonizing and holding our breaths throughout the film.Technically the film was amazing. But it was looooong and got tiring after a while. There were long films that were telling a story (like LOTR) that were smooth and had highs and lows nicely distributed and even though it was longer than Batman the time flew and I enjoyed it. Batman was ""bang bang bang bang bang"" one after the other, the other, the other, the other until my head hurt and I started looking at my watch. ""Be done already"" I kept thinking... ""what else can POSSIBLY happen now!?"" so many things happened! I am telling you it could have been two films...I gave it a 9 because otherwise it really was a good, good, good film... and for a while I did enjoy it. After a while I just wanted out of the theater... And RIP Heath... we will miss you!"
7803,True,"This is honestly the best film i've seen in many many years.Acting? Superb. Heath Ledger really gets into the character of the Joker. He was so convincing and captured and held the audience in his hands. Especially with his tricks and witty disguises, such as the nurse, etc., it was like waiting for a monster to jump out at you any second. Christian Bale is an amazing Batman, and really plays the hero-guardian well, his emotions well displayed. Aaron Eckhart makes a convincing hero-gone-villain, and Maggie Gylenhaall is the icing on the cake with a wonderful, graceful performance.The plot was so well done, it was hard to believe that it was just a movie. The way the Joker gets into your mind...unbelievable. I was shaking in my seat the whole two hours and thirty minutes. They even manage to get a few laughs here and there because of the Joker's eccentric and witty, yet dark antics.*HERE BE SPOILERS!* As dark as it may sound, I also love how the end is left for the audience to think about - it's not a sunshine-and-rainbows, happy-go-lucky ending about the end of the Joker and the resurrection of Two-Face. No. The ending is dark and pessimistically illustrated as the beginning.And it's not just a story about comic book characters killing each other, conquering, and overpowering, but also connects with the human heart as well. ""You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain."" Step aside, Spiderman, The Dark Knight wins it all.I'm definitely getting this DVD when it comes out. It will change how you see comic book movies - if not movies in general at all - forever. This is NOT a typical summer time-waster of a blockbuster. Sometimes, I wish IMDb had over 10 star ratings, for these kinds of superb, excellent, movies. Best two hours and thirty minutes of my summer. Best movie of the summer. 11/10"
7804,True,The Dark Knight 7-19-08 The Dark Knight is a phenomenal film in almost every conceivable way. It is proof that mainstream Hollywood films can be good and at the end of the day this film and the few others like it are the reason I hate most Hollywood films. You see they don't have to be as bad as they usually are and TDK is proof of this. This film also proves that films based on comic book super heroes don't have to be childish and silly. Here we have a film that deals with tough issues that are quite relevant to our times and I'm certain the times to come. Should we despair at a world that is tearing itself apart or fight back? Is such a fight futile and what if in the process of mounting such an effort we become what it is we sought to vanquish. The are but a few of the questions I felt this film asked me. It is of note that it managed to pose such questions w/o seeming overly didactic or preachy. As far as the cinematic elements...they are all working quite well in this film. Cinematography is brilliant with emphasis on a bland/cool color palette that is certainly appropriate. It should also be noted that this has to be one of the best paced two and a half hour films I've bore witness to. It never slows down and when its over you are ready for more. Lastly one cant not mention Heath Ledger's remarkable performance as The Joker. One of the great comic book villains finally gets a worthy portrayal on the big screen. I'm certain that in the years to come I will have much more to say about this film so I will end this statement by proclaiming TDK as one of the best films I've seen in years period.
7805,True,"Alright, so i just saw ""The Dark Knight"" for the second time, and I must revise my previous review.I consider this movie a 7, however, one character singlehandedly raised my vote to an 9 - the Joker. Heath Ledger truly deserves an Oscar, sympathy aside. His performance was chilling and simply superb. This movie should have been called The Joker.Now onto Batman. What was up with his voice, he sounded like he should be singing for Lamb of God, however, he came off strong the second time through. Harvey Dent should not have turned into two-face so late, however, he truly was a great piece in this movie.In conclusion, i will say the first half of this movie was a 10, especially the first half hour. All in all, 9/10, and you can thank Ledger for that one."
7806,True,"I have seen every Batman movie and read the comics for years. This movie is as well written, directed and acted as I have ever seen. The movie believe it or not, is bigger than the hype surrounding it.Heath Ledger portrays the Clown Prince of Crime the way he should: Psychotic, ruthless, maniacal and just plain crazy. The story behind the Joker's background is a different from the original comic story line but very interesting. The explanation from the Joker himself does not disappoint. Gotham is corrupt, dark and so are a good many of the public servants. You can't trust anyone. This movie is awesome. Like James Lipton inside the actors studio, ""What ever you are doing, stop right now and go see the Dark Knight, it is delightful!"" After watching this movie, I can say ""I miss you already Heath""."
7807,True,"Christian Bale and Heath Ledger have succeeded in making a fantastic Batman movie in every respect.So many people were worried that Heath Ledger would not be able to live up to Jack Nicholsons portrayal of the Joker but its clear that he in fact surpasses him in every way, which will please fans of the original source material.I believe that this movie surpasses Batman Begins in every way with a few minor exceptions: 1. Wayne Manor and the Batcave from Begins are cooler and darker than the penthouse and way to bright room where Batman now keeps his gear.2. I do not like seeing Batman walk around sort of hanging out with the police because it cheats the mystery of Batman a lot like Kilmer and Clooney's Batman's.3. There could of been more time with Batman fighting people. I think the ending sequence of Begins was more pumping than the ending of the Dark Knight.Aside from these few minor and practically non existent issues, The Dark Knight was a fantastic movie from beginning to end and I cant wait until Nolan makes another one."
7808,True,"Working at Blockbuster Video it takes a lot for me to go to the theatre to see films. I went to an early midnight showing and was not disappointed in the least. This movie has an all-star cast and Bale once again performs both Bruce Wayne and Batman to the fullest. Hedger is scary good and of course Freeman is always great as the technological mastermind behind all of Batman's gadgets. The plot is great and the fighting is awesome. For me however, there were a few minor faults...1) Scarecrow was suddenly a fighter of good? And his henchman came complete with ""batman"" attire? So you're trying to convince me that a villain like the scarecrow, who lived to bring people into a state of insanity is good? and without any explanation??? 2) Batman was more punch and less thought. Now I understand it was written this way, but let's be serious. Batman has to choose between Rachel or Harvey Dent...naturally Bruce chooses Rachel. But Batman would have and should have known this was a trick, it is the Joker for crying out loud. I mean he knew that the ""Jokers"" in the warehouse were the hostages tied up, taped up, and masked, but he couldn't see that Joker told Batman where the opposite was?? I don't buy it, sorry.3) And this is perhaps just old school preference here but...The cape looked way to un-batman. First off the masked just looked way too tight. Secondly, I like the idea of the cape, but I want it ALL the time. It's cool that is expands or whatever during fall, but I want a blowing-in-the-wind ""BAT"" cape.Overall, was the movie worth a midnight showing, and is it worth going to in two days with my buddy from work, yes and yes. But was it as good as Batman Begins...I don't think so."
7809,True,"The most anticipated movie of the year finally hits screens this Friday, both in 2-D and IMAX formats. Christian Bale returns as the mysterious and ultra rich Bruce Wayne/Batman. Violence has plagued the streets in Gotham City (which looks a lot like Chicago) and Batman teams up with Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to weed out the crime, in which a new villain arrives, played by the late Heath Ledger, the Joker, unleashing unspeakable horror and crime to the citizens of Gotham City. It becomes the Joker's mission to beat Batman at his own game, therefore making his revenge very personal as he playfully quips, ""Criminals used to believe in things like honor, respect. What doesn't kill you makes you stranger"". I'm totally recommending The Dark Knight to be seen on the biggest screen possible, perhaps at an IMAX screen nearest you. Watching Christopher Nolan's near masterpiece gave me a whole new level of movie-going experience and this fascinating director has definitely set the bar even higher for comic book based movies, which he had already done with his earlier film, Batman Begins. This is the first Hollywood film that used IMAX digital cameras that was partially shot in this new and improved format. I certainly experienced vertigo in certain scenes as the camera hovered above city skyscrapers such as the ones that took place in Hong Kong as Batman stood still on the corner of a building looking down. The Dark Knight delivers in all areas. But let me for a talk for a second about the action scenes. They are definitely incredible! The death-defying stunt work looks pretty authentic and any computer generated imagery was covert and difficult to pin-point. Take for example as Batman's heavy armored vehicle loses all power and it reactivates itself into some sort of over-sized motorcycle; Batman races at breakneck speeds through tunnels and buildings then in and around a 18' wheeler, flipping it violently upside down with Bat-wires. An incredible feat that only last seconds but one where I had to catch my breath. Much has been talked about Ledger's eerie portrayal of the Joker. Ledger loses himself in this role like Marlon Brando did in The Godfather and Anthony Hopkins does in The Silence of the Lambs. It's sorrowfully chilling and definitely that good. He'll for sure be nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar as should the film for Best Picture. At over 2 1/2 hours long, this is definitely one of the longest comic book based movies, but Nolan and his editor, Lee Smith, move things along just fine. There is some fine music by two maestros, James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer, both Academy Award winners; they don't inundate us with heavy piercing sound through the actions scene but instead let those scenes entertain us for themselves. The cinematography and set designs are dark and moody but appropriate for this type of film. With it's technical accomplishments, very fine performances (including Morgan Freeman as technical wizard Lucius Fox and Michael Caine as butler Alfred Pennyworth) most especially by Ledger, The Dark Knight is not only one of the best films of the year (which also works splendidly as a crime thriller) but will go down in history as the best comic book based movie ever."
7810,True,"This movie does not deliver on any level. What a boring, long, agonizing film this is. This movie will do well due to the unfortunate circumstance with Ledger and the DC Batman following. But to be honest this movie is dull and falls very short of the hopes I had for it. Sorry fans but I call them like I see them. The dialog was terrible and scene after scene it seemed that the film makers just repeated the same things over and over again. Was there ever any suspense? Were you ever really worried about the outcome? No to both. The movie was well made to be fair. Visually it held up. Ledger did a fine job with his role. Had he not died would we really be building this into what it has become? No again. Save your money and wait for HBO to see this."
7811,True,"While the central performance from Heath Ledger is a superb portrayal of madness the muddled plot and centre sound channel for the vocals makes this piece of storytelling very difficult to follow. In fact, I had to watch the Blu-ray of this film in three sittings because I got so frustrated with it until the last 30 minutes or so when it did actually introduce a fairly original idea (the two ships primed to explode). There are too many poorly developed characters in this film which meant I didn't really care about any of them. I seem to remember that the first film in this relaunched series ('Batman Begins') was also muddled but at least that was was a bit more comprehensible than this follow-up due to the first segment explaining Batman's origin. A couple of points - why does Batman talk in that ridiculous husky voice while as Bruce Wayne he does not? Presumably, so that he is not recognised as his alter-ego but I just found it laughable. Why does the aspect ratio change from standard widescreen to the IMAX format for the action sequences? This is either an unnecessary gimmick - (films should be kept in one aspect ratio or the other) or they couldn't afford to shoot the whole film in IMAX."
7812,True,"First disappointment was X-files,if anyone seen this film then knows what I am talking about,but the second biggest disappointment is the Darn knight, I don't know maybe I expected to much from the second part of The Dark knight, first was intriguing and I was looking forward to see in the next movie more action not huge amount of dialogs and monologues and between them 5 minutes of action.Fight scenes are horrible, why the coordinator of martial arts didn't hire a real martial arts specialist, the knows its job.Fight scenes are so lame,and that when a man with batman suit fights I expected some kind of unreal tricks,real kicking, but not like this.Car scenes are next horrible scenes,because it could more, faster,and more collisions.I can rate it as a drama for 8/10, but as a fantasy,thriller,action only 6/10"
7813,True,"The first film in the re-imagining of the series was a big hit, but this sequel was a global success, especially with the superb performance by the star of Brokeback Mountain who tragically died from a (prescribed) drugs overdose shortly after filming had finished, from director Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia). Basically a criminal terrorist and mastermind calling himself the Joker (posthumous Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Heath Ledger) robs the bank run by the mob, and to take on the Mafia district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) becomes the new face for justice and hope in Gotham City, with the help of Batman aka Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) and Lieutenant James 'Jim' Gordon (Gary Oldman). Mob bosses Sal Maroni (Eric Roberts), Gambol (Michael Jai White) and the Chechen (Ritchie Coaster), who have had Chinese accountant Lau (Chin Han) hide their funds, are confronted by the Joker because he wants to kill the, but they all refuse to help, putting a bounty on him. The Joker kills Gambol, and his gang go under his control, and meanwhile Batman, with new technology supplied by Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), has found and returned Lau to Gotham to testify in a court case to help bring down the gangsters. The Joker puts his plan into action by threatening the city, if the Dark Knight does not reveal his true identity he will kill people, and soon enough he starts killing the people involved in the mob boss court cases, including Commissioner Loeb (The Fast Show's Colin McFarlane) and Judge Surrillo (Nydia Rodriguez Terracina), and Dent may be next. Dent is hidden, and Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who has been dating Dent is being looked after by Bruce's faithful butler Alfred Pennyworth (Sir Michael Caine), but the Joker appears to kill Gordon, who sacrifices himself to save the Mayor (Nestor Carbonell), and when Bruce plans to reveal his identity to the press Dent claims he is the Batman. This means that the district attorney is taken into protective custody, but the Joker catches up and tries to kill him, but Batman inside his armoured car and then on his motorcycle is on their tail, and Gordon who faked his death catches the criminals, and gets promoted to Commissioner. Batman demands to know from the clown prince of crime where Dent and Rachel are, as they have disappeared, and eventually, after some beating, he reveals that they are both in separate buildings full of explosives, Batman planned to find Rachel, but he instead gets to Dent, so Rachel is blown up and dies, while Dent is taken out, but petrol on half his face ignites when the explosion happens. Using documents, Wayne Enterprises accountant Mike Engel (Anthony Michael Hall) has concluded that Bruce Wayne is Batman, so he plans blackmail, and meanwhile the Joker has escaped prison and kills Lau and the Chechen, and he threatens to bomb a hospital if Reese isn't killed. While the accountant is rescued by Gordon, the Joker visits Dent in hospital, who has become scarred on half his face and donned the persona of Two-Face, he tells him that the mob is responsible for the death of Rachel and convinces him to get revenge, on a coin flip decision. Gotham General Hospital was blown up, while Two-Face manages to find and kill Maroni and two corrupt cops who helped kidnap Rachel, and the Joker has rigged two ships, one carrying civilian passengers and the other Arkham Asylum inmates, with explosives, and both sets of people have the trigger for the opposite ship, with the demand to blow up the other ship before midnight, or both be exploded. With the help of Fox and a computer as a citywide tracking device, they manage to find where the Joker is, in a building, where hostages are wearing clown masks to look like criminals to the SWAT, but they are saved, both ships refuse to blow up each other, and the Joker despite being caught boasts that he has won when Dent's rampage will be revealed. Gordon is lured to the building where Rachel died where his wife and children are being held hostage, and Dent is threatening their lives from the flip of his coin, and after being shot while wearing body armour Batman tackles Dent, causing him to fall from the top of the building to the ground, and saving Gordon's son. So that Dent will remain a symbol of hope for Gotham City, Batman wants to take responsibility for the deaths of the people Dent murdered, Gordon is upset but is forced to agree, so he orders a manhunt for Batman, while Alfred spares Bruce anymore heartache by burning a letter that Rachel wrote announcing her engagement to Harvey, and Fox sees the tracking computer self-destruct. Also starring Monique Gabriela Curnen as Ramirez, Ron Dean as Wuertz, Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow aka Dr. Jonathan Crane, William Fichtner as Bank Manager and The Fifth Element's Tommy 'Tiny' Lister as Tattooed Prisoner. Bale is still fantastic as the silly playboy and the rough and ready dark hero, Ledger is fascinating as the psychopathic and intelligent scar-faced villain (the licking of lips is a great psycho touch), Eckhart is alright as the slowly maddened political figure turned Two-Face, and the other cast members are good too. Just with the previous film the story is much more grown up and sophisticated compared to the previous incarnations, the make-up is good, and of course the explosions and special effects used create many more exciting chase and fight sequences, a cool and entertaining action fantasy. It won the Oscar for Best Sound Editing, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Makeup, Best Sound and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Make Up & Hair, Best Music for Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, Best Production Design, Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!"
7814,True,"I have just returned from watching THE DARK KNIGHT, which is in the last week of a six-week engagement at the Coliseum near where I live. I purposely watched the movie to honor Heath Ledger, which I said I would do in an earlier post that seems to have been rejected - the first posting ever made about this movie, in fact. Ledger was a talented man who would have made many more movies if he had lived. The movie was totally bizarre, but the plot was well-structured and Heath gave a convincing performance as the mad Clown of Crime, a scarred madman who is hired by Gotham City's mobsters to destroy the Batman and bring down Harvey Dent, the city's visible public crusader."
7815,True,"The Dark Knight has been grotesquely over-praised. It is a passably competent superhero movie, albeit one with few virtues and a great many flaws. It certainly is not one of the greatest films of all time - it shouldn't even be in the top fifty.The virtues first. Heath Ledger's performance is quite good. Not brilliant - quite good. He has little to work with, but he does do his best with it. Although his Joker is more a mass of tics and mannerisms than anything deeper, they are memorable - and he brings a bit of gusto and a sense of a personality.The other actors, all of them very good in other films, have even less to do than Heath - they work bravely to round out dull, simplistic lines and resoundingly empty characters. Nobody here, except Commissioner Gordon, has any suggestion of a home life. Nobody has any personality. These people are plot functions, pawns in moving things from A to B. Of the good guys, Maggie Gyllenhaal perhaps goes the furthest in investing her character with some spark.The flaws? Numerous. For a start, the film shows bad editing and direction for the fight and chase sequences. Half the time, it isn't clear who is near to who or what they are in danger from. Meanwhile, the overall visual style is bland and unimaginative and suspense is generally minimal because every twist is thuddingly obvious.The dialogue is functional but clumsy - for example, we are told twice, just in case we didn't get it, that Harvey Dent may be prepared to take on the criminals of Gotham but he feels scared at a fund-raising dinner. Nobody, in the entire movie, not once, reacts like a real human being, to anything that happens - everything is stagey, simplistic, artificial.And the philosophy? The depth that is supposed to make this ""more than a comic book movie""? Not there. For a start, it is impossible to take seriously pronouncements on the human condition from a movie whose view of crime is that criminals are all either members of a Dick Tracy style mob underworld who sit around in suits, embodying racial and cultural stereotypes and talking about how the Batman is cutting in on their action, on the one hand, or pure, unexplainable EEEEEVIL freaks on the other. As a representation of evil, sin, temptation, crime or madness, this is so pathetically empty and stupid and clichéd it would be unimpressive in a children's cartoon. To anyone who has seen The Wire, read the news or even just been outside and talked to actual adults, it seems laughable. It's hard to take a movie seriously at all when its sense of crime comes down to something so callow and so naive.But apart from that, the movie does not seem to have the courage of its convictions. It flirts with an authoritarian message about needing a superman to protect us from chaos, someone who has to be empowered with the right to pry into our privacy and lie to us - a daddy who always knows best. And it toys with the idea that humans are fundamentally bad - but then decides that, no, people aren't after all (when neither group on the ships chooses to blow the other up). Except when they are (as Harvey Dent turns to the dark side). This is not searing complexity. This is trying not to offend anyone whilst flirting with relevance to contemporary political debates. This is saying nothing, very loudly and a bit pompously."
7816,True,"What an anti-climax! There we go, I said right it off the bat. If Nolan wanted a character driven movie... he failed. Maggie Gyllenhall was like a wooden version of Katy Holmes, which I thought wasn't possible. Also playing a two timing hussy wasn't exactly an endearing quality. I'm tired of listening to Bale over-act Batman, someone fix his speech impediment please so he doesn't look & sound like he's trying to lay a Guiness World Record pineapple. How anyone can get an Oscar is beyond me, Ledger doesn't actually get enough screen time in my view & making slurping noises with your mouth doesn't sell crazy. Heath said that he wanted audiences to forget Jack Nicholson as the Joker but I was often thrust down memory lane, all the way back to the original Batman. Nicholson had been playing crazy long before Batman, One Flew Over the Cockoo's Nest, The Shining etc, so Ledger really had a tough task... in which he did OK but not Oscar nommie stuff. Also, what happened to the dark 'gothic' Gotham City Burton created? You can't have CGI Two Face in a normal looking US city, I wanted the full dark comic style of old! It felt like the movie dragged a little & had some weird head shaking anomalies, eg: When Batman drops Mafia Boss, seemingly breaking his ankles but later he seems fine with his ornamental walking stick. I couldn't help laughing at Batman's motorbike & the great wall stunt. Not at all what I had hoped for in this semi-entertaining film... the Box Office is happy tapping into the female ticket sale as they finally go & see a Batman movie for their lost heart throb Heath but I heard snoredom from the rows of girls behind me. Bring Burton back to Batman!!!"
7817,True,"I went into the dark knight with the hopes of seeing a great, fun summer film. All my hopes of it being great was crushed after the first 20 minutes. The movie was long and the fight scenes messy. The film story was supposedly based on Heat, but it did not even compare. The only positives i saw was that Heath Ledger was good as the joker and Aaron Eckhart was good as Two face. I was actually really disappointed with the story and character of Batman. This film had discriminating undertones and was almost racist. I was turned off by Christopher Nolan script he had written, the film was too dramatic and Batman so emo. The first Batman film was great, but this film had too much propaganda for the government and gave the wrong message to Batman fans."
7818,True,"Heath Ledger played a brilliant Joker, and Christian Bale was a good Batman. Batman is supposed to be for little kids. It should not be dark and scary. This was by far the worst Batman Movie. I would still hope that they will continue the adventure. It just completely veered away from how Batman should be. The actors were good. The plot was horrible. Harvey Dent is not a good guy. I don't care how many criminals he put away. Batman put away many more. You cant let a horrible and psychologically unstable man be remembered as a good guy. The Joker was EXCELLENT. It was Heath's best role ever. I am just sad to see him go. This is just my opinion of the movie. I encourage everyone to see it and create their own opinions."
7819,True,"This film is more fun than Star Wars, more thrilling than Indiana Jones, more morally insightful than Gandhi, more heartwarming than It's A Wonderful Life....That's all to placate the folks who get furious at anything but paeans of adulation for this film.First of all, I'm sick to death of movies where the bad guy gets free by holding a human shield. With cops five feet away aiming at his head and the hostage yelling ""Take the shot."" Isn't that what they have firing ranges for? So you can learn to aim a gun? These clowns deserved to get themselves blown up. It's the stupidest cliché in film - Enough, Already! And this film is l-o-o-n-g. I was looking at my watch thinking ""They haven't even gotten to the ferryboat scene yet?"" Harvey Dent knows Gotham is full of evil. He charges 500+ gangsters on one RICO charge. Yet, when his girl friend is killed by the same criminals, he blames the person who saved him instead of the criminals, and does a total 180. Just not believable.Bringing down the World Trade Center would have been a piece of cake compared to all the explosives the Joker installs. How do you put a bomb in every nook and cranny of a hospital without anyone noticing?The people who see deep moral issues in this film must be fascinated by blinking lights and totally perplexed by paper clips. The Joker gets as far as he does precisely because the good guys fail to take action. And I'm sorry, but I just don't see Bruce Wayne's use of cell phones to track the Joker as morally problematic. I would definitely not want that technology to fall into certain hands, but wrong? How? Now the good parts. Give Ledger his posthumous Oscar - he's loathsome, which means he's great. The action is intense and well orchestrated. The greatest hero in the movie is a convict on one of the endangered ferryboats who gives us a moment of pure nobility. It makes for an exciting evening, but not greatness."
7820,True,"First of all, I need to point out that I'm not a Batman fan, or Superman, or Marvel, may be a Vertigo, D.C. yes, but I try to be totally neutral when I review a movie.I have watched all Batman movies, including Batman Begins. But I find myself hard to explain what is the purpose of making a new Batman movie. Well Batman Begins point out that Batman must have his background history, how Batman became Batman himself. But I found Batman Begins with a lot of failures, like: the action sequence camera, some special effects are cheap, and it's not even a good movie. Not a masterpiece at all. And I found myself trying to digest how the daily and actual public of cinema ignores what a real masterpiece could be, it's a shame how we have ignore the epic work of real masterpiece, the hard dedication it takes to do a tremendous film. The Dark Knight points out to be more realistic than the other Batman movies, but not darker, since Batman Returns it's know as the darker one of all Batman films. Batman has been changed from a 60's family show, to a darker series of movies but the Dark Knight cannot make the plot of a millionaire dressed like a bat, fighting against villains and crazy maniac realistic, because the plot doesn't need to be realistic. Batman in a realistic way it's having another hero, not Batman. So then the point of making another Batman movie because it's going to be realistic it's meaningless. May be the movie it has a serious point, butnot really. The acting was overall good, but some of the acting in the film it's feels like it's natural, not hard to act, it's just simple. The action sequences are really good, or at least better than Batman Begins, but there is not enough action to really name the movie an action movie, the special effects where the best part. To have a better knowledge of the characters, you need to watch Batman Begins, but there is no background history of the main antagonist: The Joker. You can't consider this movie as an action-present movie, where the only things that matters is what you see trough the entire film because the last movie would be meaningless, but it's not so cleaver what are the real characters purposes either. Also the personality of all the characters are too simple or too complex (I mean, they could be a lot of options of what is the real meaning of the character's actions), that you get eventually confused. May be this was an attempt of making the movie more realistic (with different thoughts, feelings and values over a confused mind), but having a personality like the Joker, and having a realistic personality of Batman it really doesn't fit. Another thing is that there is no blood where it should be in the movie, which is not realistic, and I'm not saying a movie need blood in order to be good, because I enjoyed watching physiological terror like Rosemary Baby, showing horror movies doesn't need to have action violence, with blood in order to be good, but the lack of blood it just points that the movie can't be realistic, because realistic means aggressive too. The dialog had changed into something different from a Super Hero movie.So at the end it leaves me the question of: What is this movie?Not realistic, but not really a child movie either. Not comedy but not so serious. Not Super Hero, But not Hero movie either. Not drama movie.I'm sure producers and the staff in general worked hard to bring the best material in this movie, you can see that, but it seems they tried to satisfy all kind of public and because of that it doesn't have a solid structure to describe it. May be they where so concentrated in the special effects they didn't take care a lot of those things, either way you can't skip out those mistakes, having a movie without an structure, it's having a man without a vertebral spine, and by structure I mean a purpose, more than satisfy Batman's fans. My conclusion is: this is a Blockbuster, an ""ok"" movie with some great special effects but without an structure to make it solid, a meaning to make ourselves concentrate on that specific point like comedy, or drama. And I'm sure, this is not a masterpiece."
7821,True,I First Saw Batman Begins on Holiday in Australia about a year after its release Being a fan of Tim Burton's batman Films on seeing the Dark knight film i am glad i never Waited a year to see it i have to say i enjoyed the movie as whole but was disappointed with a few thingsWarning May contain Spoilers!!!!The back story to joker was not very Clear as far as i was a where he was Droped in to a vat of chemicals but in this movie he is mad because his father beat his mother and so went insanehaving two-face in this Movie was Waste of time we had about 3/4 2 min Scenes then he was dead I have to Say we Lost A Great Actor in Heath ledger he played joker well in this Movie and had some great Lines but i do prefer jack Nicklson All in All A Good movie will there be another one lets hope so
7822,True,"There's no questioning that this movie is quite spectacular for the most part. Heath Ledger's Joker was one of the most spectacular characters I've ever seen on screen... unfortunately, that's about all I have to say good about it. For the most part, any scene that has him in it is amazing, but everything else just... loses it's shine.In all honesty, I didn't like Batman Begins, I thought it was overrated and had the largest plot hole in the history of the world (a machine that can instantly vaporize water without vaporizing the water puddles on the street, let alone making humans explode or making metal hot), and I found the same sort of flaw within the Dark Knight. These movies take themselves so painfully seriously, and I give it to them, they're amazing in that seriousness. There's almost no 'comic book' residue until two face comes around. Then, all of a sudden, we're supposed to remember that this is, in fact, a comic book movie, and that the man can run around with open wounds, no medication and function normally. No, this doesn't work for me.There were far too many loose ends. Yes, it was a decent movie. On first glance, it's brilliant, but the second that you actually think about things (such as the fact that Batman threw the mafia boss off a third story balcony, breaking/shattering his legs, and then the guy was walking around the very next day). It's overrated. It's good, but it's overrated.I'm not much in the form of caring if I get flamed for this review, but this is my honest opinion. It's good, it really is, but it's not a 'Masterpiece'. It's a movie... but it's not the best movie. It didn't entertain me father than the first half, and that means that it failed where a movie is supposed to succeed: entertaining."
7823,True,"Now when a person watches a superhero movie,well most superhero movies such as superman and batman % Robin failed,with n hype no genius plot no nothing they just sucked with bad acting,a unimpressive storyline,unimpressive camera play the whole movie was a bit of a disappointment but this movie,The Dark Knight,was something whole differentNow I wouldn't give any movie a 10 only good ones and not ones which had an impressive amount of blood but the whole movie and this movie was perfectPerfect acting by Bruce Wayne and Heath Ledger,the camera the story was all magnificent the plot was GENIUS and I am not going to try and spoil the movie but seeing what the joker can do was impressive turning a city into chaos with tough cliffhangers and situations which seem bad turn even more bad.The joker could turn one of the most beloved people of Gotham into a criminal.And the ending was brilliant,all I can say is watch it not actually buy the Dark Knight Trilogy with all 3 masterpieces."
7824,True,"there is only 1 word for this movie !!! AWESOME !!!This was so much more than a Batman film, this was so much more than a comic book film, The Dark Knight truly delivers with drama, action, romance, horror, dark humor, the study of a psychopathic killer, a detective story. The force behind this epic movie is Christopher Nolan, who's previous film, Batman Begins, didn't really thrill me, but his incredible film making is truly shown in The Dark Knight, the shots that he got of Gotham City were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city, part of the Batman story. One of the things that I absolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic book movie, you know it's not real, people don't dress up in costumes, and save the day, villains don't name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes, but The Dark Knight actually makes it seem incredibly real, like it could happen.Bruce Wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of Batman and himself, he has lost Rachel to the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, he's inspiring others who are dressing up as Batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. But things are much worse when the Joker waltzes into town, and he's going to bring Hell upon Gotham City. Constantly playing with Gotham's mind and trying to get Batman to reveal himself, Batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. The Joker has named himself as the ""Classy Villain that Gotham needs"", he also has brought a new thought into Batman's head of them actually being more alike than different, that Batman completes him, the Joker would be nothing without him. But Batman is relying on Harvey Dent, who is Gotham's ""White Knight"" trying to put all of Gotham's scum in jail. But when the Joker plays Batman and Commissioner Gordon, Harvey and Rachel find themselves in very horrific position and Harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.All the performances are dead on in this movie, now everyone's going crazy over Heath Ledger's performance, but one performance I would also love to credit is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two Face, his performance was just as great as Heath's and made Two Face a human villain. You could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became Two Face. I know that everyone is saying this but I truly mean when I say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. We had some great movies these past few years, but I think The Dark Knight is seriously something special, but I don't wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. In my opinion though this is not a great movie, I can't come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was, to be honest I would go above a 10 rating if I could; this is the Batman film that we have been waiting for. I've seen it twice in one weekend, I'm going to see it three times this upcoming week, I don't mind one bit. I can't wait for the sequel and I would just like to say RIP to Heath, wish he could have seen his breath taking performance as The Joker."
7825,True,"Perfect is a word I never use when talking about films but this breaks the rule. Here are my top reasons for giving this a solid 10/10.1.) Acting. All the acting in the film is great, Aaron Eckharts troubled Harvey Dent really allows us to see how easy it is to fall into evil. Christian Bale not only gives us a good Batman but a good Bruce Wayne as well, Michael Caine is forever excellent as Alfred and Gary Oldman does really well portraying the tough Jim Gordon. However Heath Ledger is the star of the show as the Joker. He gives us an insane, disturbing character who seems very real and very, very evil. His performance is in my mind the best portrayal of character in film EVER! 2.) Story. The story is full of exciting twists and links to the comic books. There are no plot holes and the story rockets from action scene to action scene however the bits in between are still interesting and develop the characters really well.3.) Effects/Props. The effects on this film are great from the chase through Gotham to the machines and make up. The new Bat Suit is better than the already good one in Batman Begins and the final battle scene is very very well done.So overall this film although being almost 3 hours is engrossing the the last minute. Everything from the dialogue to the prosthetics to score seems to hit the target."
7826,True,"I have recently bought all three in blue ray version: Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises.This 2nd installment is the only one that had the most screen time and being watched repeatedly.The characters are so well written and played by all. The dialogs, the story flows were superb. The dialog between Joker & Batman inside MCU and when Joker was hanging upside down was classic. Most of all, the logic of the story telling was believable, all except the part that I don't understand why Harvey Dent didn't put a bullet to Joker's head at the hospital when he was so mad of his loses on Rachel when clearly Joker was part of it too.If I would rate from the best, better to great. It would be The Dark Knight > Batman Begins > The Dark Knight Rises."
7827,True,"I loved ""Batman Begins"" so i was excited to watch ""The Dark Knight"". Evn his rating was awesome so it gave me another reason to watch it. Also, the actor who plays The Joker died at the age of twenty eight.My impressions of this film won't be like many others peoples : i didn't enjoy that much and i'm not going rate this 10/10 or 9/10 but 7/10. I will explain why : I think the movie doesn't have rhythm because it chain one action scene and one scene with only dialogs all the time. Also, there are many scenes where you think it's over but in reality it's not (when Batman get the joker at the top of the building for example). So i felt as two hours and half were a bit long.Except all i told above, i liked the other things of the film. The Joker was nice and Heath Ledger played him very well."
7828,True,"I really like this movie. I love Batman. I must say that this is one of the best films I've seen!!!I like it much better than Batman Begins but I think that it ended too fast and that two face shouldn't have died.. This movie is one of the best movies on the planet because of Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker. The story is so exciting and you are waiting with anticipation to see what happens next. The film sees Batman confront the Joker as he gets trapped in his twisted little games along the way.If you haven't seen this movie, get out there and buy it because I'm telling you that you won't regret it.I give the film a 10/10."
7829,True,"First of all look at the Title It doesn't say ""Batman"", Its just The Dark Knight This movie is not about a superhero saving the Girl and the day. Its about a Sociopath ""Joker"" who just want to destroy every moral and make people realize that no one is socially correct.""Some people cannot be negotiated or Talked, Some people just want to watch the world burn""(Extract from Movie) From direction to acting the movie is fantastic, Its not just another Superhero movie. Its shows us how really we can be a superhero in everyone's eye.Joker is one of the best villain played ever by a actor on the silver screen."
7830,True,"Review of: The Dark Knight Director Christopher Nolan certainly did not cease to amaze his audience with this film. I was at first skeptical as to whether he would be able to trump his first film in the series, Batman Begins; however, Christopher proved that my apprehensions were misplaced.The cinematography in this film was spectacular. The wide angle, sweeping views of both Hong Kong and Gotham were astounding. They allowed the viewer to see that these characters did not live in a bubble, where their actions had no effect on others around them; but rather that they were part of their respective cities and their actions had consequences, very much true to life. The special effects also left nothing to be wanted. The pyrotechnics and stunts left me gazing at the screen just trying to take in every detail.While everyone was aware of the blatantly obvious cast switch concerning the character Rachel Dawes, I did not think it hindered the progression of the movie. Typically, such a blatant cast change severely detracts from the quality of a movie, however, Maggie Gyllenhaal did an excellent job taking Katie Holmes' position and dare I say, even played the part to a better degree.Christian Bale played, what I believe to be, the best Batman to date. Growing up I thought George Clooney and Val Kilmer, the Batmen from my day, never did justice to the character or portrayed him as he should be. While the voice modulation was over done, the darkness portrayed in the new caped crusader fulfilled the part that was severely lacking.I also thought Aaron Eckhart played an astounding Harvey Dent/ Two-Face. As a good guy, he was admirable, but after the Joker finished with him, you could feel his writhing anger, pain, and wickedness. His quest for retribution struck a cord in me. His quote, ""It's not about what I want, it's about what's fair"" reminded me of many of the complaints society, myself included, make on a daily basis. We feel we are entitled to fairness on some level. However, the Bible says that if we truly wanted fairness we would spend eternity in Hell paying for our sin. This is a sobering truth when I catch myself complaining about fairness.Of course, no discussion on this case is complete without mention of Mr. Ledger's performance. Heath Ledger's performance was every bit worthy of the Oscar he was awarded. He truly brought the role of the Joker to life and captivated his audience with his ability to play the villain in this film. The audience did not hesitate to believe him when he told Batman at the end of the movie that they were going to be locked in their battle forever. He truly was the perfect opposite to the hero in this film and his acting ability will be missed.The musical scores selected for this film greatly added to the viewing experience and played on the audience's emotions. The climactic periods were significantly enhanced by the dramatic composition changes during the film.While this film was an astounding two and a half hours it kept you attention for the entire duration. What you thought was the movie concluding ended up only deepening the plot and setting the stage for the rise of Two-Face.Morality permeates the overtones of this film. The whole plot, in essence, is to make the case that Gotham is changing and has some good people in it. The Joker tries to raze this concept by proving that ""Civilized people are only as good as the world allows them to be."" As it relates to real life, the Joker has a point. Unless people are living for something bigger than they are, everyone will have a breaking point.This film never gets old; it will keep its audience on the edge of their seats viewing after viewing. It was not my intention to draw ""Christian"" themes from this movie (I can't stand it when people attempt to do that from any media). It was merely my intention to provide a review from a Christian who enjoys good movies."
7831,True,When i first heard about The dark knight i thought 'Not another batman movie' but then my cousin made me go and since then I have went to see it twice in the cinema and seen it about 6 times on DVD. It is the best movie ever--Christian bale gives a good performance(even with the too of deep voice) But what takes it is Heath Ledger as the joker which is the best villain ever.The story was good(again the joker made it)and most of the characters were good(actress who played Rachel dawns wasn't great).This movie is put down by many people because its batman but its nothing like the normal type superhero movies and anyone of loves action has to see this once in a life time---come lets put it back into the cinema again.
7832,True,"I just finished watching the Dark Knight for probably the 10th time. Watched it again right after watching Batman Begins.Truly, I just can not believe how close to perfect this movie is. It excites me so much, that even after so many times, I still find myself cheering, crying and smiling during.To me, this is a 10 out of 10. To me this is what a movie should be. To me this is the best movie of the decade by far, if not even more.A few things I wish could be fixed to make it a truly perfect experience: 1. The Dark Knight is the last performance of Heath Ledger. I will never be able to see anything new from him again. Heath to me is a God in this movie, and I wish he was still around, as honestly, his performance is in the top 3 of all time movie performances in my book.2. Third movie is in the works I think.. I am sure I will be disappointed. I mean how can it get any better than this????? 3. Did they have to crash the Lamborghini Murcielago? every time i see that happen I go ""geez I am here!! hello??? just call me!"" Honestly, The Dark Knight is not a movie - its an emotional experience that is rare I experience when looking at my screen.R.I.P Heath Ledger"
7833,True,"When I watched the Nolan's Batman Begins I was amazed by the film. I wasn't a kid's movie, it was haunting adventure of The Dark defender and how he was formed. The intensity and the plot of the film were out of this world. Batman Begins was my favorite movie, but then Dark Knight came along. The Plot and the acting were superb and there were surprises till the end of the movie. The way Nolan portrayed the joker was breathtaking. His laugh, his attire and his acting was amazing. The actor who played joker, Heath Ledger, did an amazing job and will be remembered for this amazing role. May His Soul Rest In Peace. Nolan was also able to put the origins of Two-Face in the movie. Harvey Dent (and later Two Face) was very powerful. All he wanted was justice and to bring down every single criminal in Gotham but one criminal, Joker, changed him and made him into the villain of Batman. Joker indirectly killed the love of his life, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and made him go out for revenge and made him a killer. The two lives of Bruce Wayne were shown beautifully. His rich playboy life and his life as Batman. Dark Knight was an amazing film and is a must watch."
7834,True,"When my dad first showed this film to me, I was utterly blown away. However, upon watching it, I found it wasn't really dark or scary, but moving and a bit disturbing. I say this because of the way the Joker is vividly portrayed by the late Heath Ledger and what he'll do to try and send Batman over the edge of corruption. Not only that, but the way that Gotham City's- and Batman's- morals are slowly disintegrated by one criminal. The best scenes were most definitely the final 20-30 minutes, the interrogation scene, and of course the bank heist scene at the start. Topped off with an all star cast that doesn't disappoint, the Dark Knight is one of the mot enjoyable movies ever made.1 thing that was a bit annoying, however... was the fact that at the start of the movie, every character decided to act like Harrison Ford by talking so softly you couldn't hear a word coming out of their mouth!9.9999999999999999999999999999 out of 10"
7835,True,"What the hell such a messy film! The joker simply can commit various crimes just because fulfilling the plot requirements. He can do any thing he can regardless of the possibility of doing so, such as setting up wires in the hospital and inserting a mobile phone in a man's stomach. Many parts have no further explanation, especially the part joker crashes the party, what the audience can see just batman and Racel talking love stuff, but what about the joker??? I hate Chistopher Nolan using tricks to cheat audience. However, many guys who rate more 8/10 for this films i think really so stupid being cheated by the GREAT director.The rubbish batman have no use in the whole movie. What he done is simply the cops doing.Anyway, this movie not suck, but not very good. It DOESNOT worth so much high ranking. Many stupid guys are being cheated, they cannot see the rubbish stuff of the movie!"
7836,True,"I once more saw ""Dark Knight"", and I'm still just as impressed. Seeing the film twice really broadens the view and the message only sinks deeper. It really is one of the best films of all time. Dramatic, action-packed, clever writing and artwork directing, with the Joker's oh so menial touches of humor, all come together as the best film of 2008 in my opinion. And with such an enormous box office success, obviously America agrees as well. And now owning ""Batman Begins"" also helps me understand the sequel more thoroughly. Gotham's fight for hope, Bruce and Rachel's tragic love story and the ultimate choice if Batman is really the hero the citizens of Gotham need and deserve, all these problem's still threaten and entwine our characters for a ride audiences are sure to never forget.Batman gets a makeover of course, as all heroes do for their sequel. The new Bat suit looks incredibly bad-ass and I love the whole armor look of it. The Bat-pod had a nice entrance and was a suitable replacement for the Tumbler. Once more the Bat-a-Rangs are put aside, not even used at all but whatever. There are plenty of new gadgets that will thrill audiences. I miss the bat-cave, which this time around is a smaller basement of sorts but it's all good. After all, it still looks good, right? Harvey's struggle to maintain loyal to justice is an exciting plot point, Aaron Eckhart delivering an ace performance I must say. I wish Katie Holmes would have reprised her character, but instead Maggie Gyllenhall got the job. It's not the acting, I just find Holmes cuter and not as old looking but I digress. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman all return thankfully and every actor's performance was excellent. Heath Ledger (RIP) gave one of the best of all time, no doubt. Psychotic yet mentally captivating would be the choice words I'm looking for. Goyer's complex story is filled with so many intricate details, all leading up to the decision of right and wrong, a true story of morality. Rachel's death was conceived perfectly and a silent Batman standing on a pile of rubble was just iconic. The clever and kick-ass action really blow you away, being so extraordinarily done. And without too much help from oh so precious CGI, the action is even better-looking. Which is my favorite action sequence in the whole film: The Prewitt Building scene or the SWAT car chase one? I really don't know but both, once again, WILL BLOW YOU AWAY!! The action is great but director Christopher Nolan relies not only on that sole factor, but the sadness and troubled lives of these characters to capture the audience. Not only that, but the music, once again by the duo of Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, was fantastic!!! Sad, dark, thrilling are only a few words to describe this soundtrack. The Joker's theme itself was great, really adding to the character. The list of reasons of why this movie is so great could go on forever, but I'll keep it at a paragraph or two."
7837,True,"This review has been swirling in my mind for ages, I watched it at the Cinemas and didn't know quite what to make of it...I was a big comic book fan, a great lover of Batman Begins, so when the trailer arrived I was in awe of Heath Ledger as the Joker and impressed by Christian's development of the Batman.....Gotham City is in turmoil as the events of Batman Begins have thrown everything into chaos, people are dressing up as Batman and fighting crime with guns, while some of Arkham's inmates are still on the loose, and the leading criminals in the City are terrified of the thing that lurks in the shadows. Until a man arrives who doesn't seem to be afraid of the Batman, a man who dresses up as a clown...a man who calls himself the, Joker.Joker unleashes hell on Gotham City torturing and killing people, blowing up buildings all in the hope of catching Batmans attention and he does, as well as Harvey Dent's, the new DA.I felt that there was too much hype building up towards this film and there were so many non-fans suddenly jumping on the band-waggon that it made it hard to distinguish if this film was truly great....Heath Ledger's portrayal was truly magnificent, he went out as a great Hollywood actor, he portrays a man truly lost to madness, a man who wants to understand why Gotham celebrates another maniac? While Aaron Eckhart plays a satisfactory Harvey Dent, he is a man who is truly trying to change things. Gary Oldman is as fine as the first, Michael Caine takes a backseat in this film but hopefully he will return in the third with a bigger part. Morgan Freeman becomes a more pivotal place within Batman's side, and does justice toward the end. Maggie Gylenhaal was okay...I felt the role needed Katie Holmes.... And finally Erice Roberts as Sal Maroni, Eric did a tremendous job playing the mobster; he oozes with charm out of every pore... And finally I come to Christian Bale. Bale takes his character to a new level, his Bruce Wayne, is broken up into two people, the brooding 'Wayne' who spends his days stitching himself back up, and staring into space with the pain he constantly feels and the Bachelor 'Bruce', a man totally ignorant of the things that are happening around him...This Batman is much more violent then the last, he's had enough and will throw you off a building if he has to...A creature that is losing the fear that he instilled in the hearts of his victims to the popularity.....And finally Christopher Nolan, Nolan focuses on the action a little more and create breathtaking sequences like the Bat-pod chase, the truck flip, Batman standing on top of a huge building and then leaping off... Nolan shows Gotham in a more brighter role, as the City gleams with happiness, almost happy at what has happened in the previous film.....I leaped out of my seat towards the end when Batman takes on the SWAT team and the criminals in order to save the innocent, absolutely beautifully choreographed.All in all, a great sequel...but hopefully will return to the roots in the third..."
7838,True,"This was a good movie...but not great. First of all I enjoyed the Joker bad guy persona so much that I was almost rooting for him at the end. Heath Ledger just consumed this part so well that I did not even recognize him, every part facial, body language and of course the smiling bad guy curl in his voice.But I found myself saying ""what the hell"" in several parts of the film. Like how did Batman not hear of the Joker before he dropped in the party. And how is a guy with a knife and handgun manage to have the ability to get away from Batman so many times. But what really did it for me was...why did Batman let the joker live at the end!!! Come on this is supposed to be the newer meaner batman...and did he not get the memo...the Joker can't come back next movie.Batman did not seem to have as many awesome toys in this movie...and his car did not hold up very well against the bad guys. And to be honest...the movie started to drag...I mean it was almost 3 Hours long."
7839,True,"After the Batman franchise was almost killed forever in Joel Schumachers 'Batman & Robin' in 1997, people feared it was the end. The film contained everything nobody wanted in a Batman film. It had Robin, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy and Batgirl. Oh and the Batman suit had nipples. It was like a sesame street version of the film in which everybody was just thrown in whether or not you liked them. Luckily in 2005 we got Batman Begins, a new era for the masked hero. It returned under completely new management. Given the task of re-inventing the series was Christopher Nolan, writer/director of Memento and The Prestige. This man cast Christian Bale. Together they made one of the years best films and now they return for a sequel. darker and more exhilarating and thrilling than all that had come before. These men made people love batman again. Despite using relatively unknown villains they made a great hero film with a great 'becoming Batman story', a twist and the right amount of action. Then came The Dark Knight. In it Batman is preparing to give up his job as hero of Gotham City and be with Rachel. He believes new district attorney Harvey Dent, Gotham's White Knight can finally clean up the streets and put the crime bosses behind bars. Then The Joker arrives. He comes in with a bang by robbing the crime bosses money from a bank and then tries to get more off them for killing Batman. He then kills one of the crime bosses as his real reign of terror begins. He starts targeting and killing everyone and everything, including police stations, hospitals, Batman impersonators, crime bosses, civilians, criminals, lawyers and even Rachel. It seems no one is safe from his rampage until Batman comes forward. Batman tries to stop him but finds it difficult due to his vow to never kill. As The Joker gains more followers and continues to eliminate more and more important government figures he tries to show Gotham that inside they are just like him and in the end he does create another villain, driven by anger and a desperate need for revenge. The battle between good and evil continues and it is like when an unstoppable force hits an unmovable object. The Joker just wants to see the world crumble and fall around him, bringing terror and violence to the city whereas Batman just wants to clean up he city so that he can move on with his life. The Dark Knight has already become known as one of the greatest films ever made (Voted 4h best on IMDb).If you ask anyone on the street what the best film of the year was and chances are they would very quickly say that it was this. It has everything that makes a good film, stunning effects, mesmerising performances, brilliant direction, a thrilling story, plot twists, action, drama, tension, chilling scenes, a fight between good and evil and a meaning to it all. I had feared that with the astronomical amount of publicity that I would be extremely disappointed but it wasn't so. Heath Ledger was by far the best thing about the film. He gave a truly phenomenal display, which has already got him a Golden Globe nomination and which will hopefully get him an Oscar. He made the role of The Joker his own and I feel sorry for anyone who will play the character again at any time in the future. He was terrifying yet chillingly humorous and it is without a doubt the best performance I have ever seen anyone give. Christian Bale returns as our favorite hero. He continues to show why he was the perfect choice for the role as he perfectly portrays the changes in his character from the arrogant and cocky Bruce Wayne to the brave and determined Batman. His voice while in the suit can get a bit annoying but it doesn't really take away form his display. There was doubt surrounding the recasting of Rachel as Stranger Then Fiction star Maggie Gyllenhaal took over from Katie Holmes who apparently 'did a great job in Batman Begins'. She was actually very bad in Batman Begins, I thought and after 5 minutes I was convinced that Maggie was a much better choice for love interest Rachel. Aaron Eckhart also gives a brilliant performance, one which is quite similar to the one he has in Thank You For Smoking. He plays Harvey Dent and both Ackhart and his character are fantastic additions to the film. Morgan Freeman returns as Lucius Fox, who has become a much more important member of Wayne Enterprises. He acts as Batman's assistant I guess and he continues to show that he really cannot give a bad performance. Gary Oldman is back as James Gordon, soon to be commissioner Gordon and he also gives a great performance, as does Michael Caine, who also features again as loyal butler and adviser Alfred. Every member of the cast give great performances and each one adds something to the film and makes that little bit more impressive. I was a bit disappointed that The Scarecrow only features in this for about 5 minutes as I hoped he would bring us into the world of Arkham Asylum but I forgot all about this with the arrival of The Joker and Two/Face. This is a masterpiece, quite simply and it's exactly what this year needed. Christopher Nolan has done an amazing job behind the camera and he makes this installment of Batman stand out from the rest by miles. it's darker, more thrilling and full of plot twists,a great ending, surprises, tragedy and of course non stop heart-pounding action. I look forward to the future films from this franchise as with this team they are sure to be just as brilliant and memorable as this was."
7840,True,"I was terribly torn between liking this movie and not, but it was so hard to shut out the hype surrounding the whole Heath Ledger performance. It WAS an incredibly nuanced performance and quite creepy to boot, but I did have a problem with the script a time or two.CONS: Apparently anyone can move untold numbers of large barrels filled with explosive materials with ease into hospitals, ports,...etc. Many of the characters seemed to be clairvoyant; knowing exact movements and reactions of everyone. The whole bullet/fingerprint scenario made absolutely no sense. The Joker was an incredible accidental planner. Too little time spent on Two-face. The soundtrack was downright annoying at times. You have to really strain to hear some of the dialogue but the action sequences bordered on too loud. (when watching at home, I have to keep the remote in hand so that I don't bother my neighbors). Bruce Wayne seemed very one-dimensional. Car chases are becoming so routine that it's hard to get excited about them anymore!PROS: Maggie Gyllenhaal was quite an improvement over Mrs. Cruise. The tone and pacing were right-on and the film looked gorgeous. The mob heads were very well cast, especially Eric Roberts. The whole Hong Kong sequence seemed contrived just for the action sake but was very well done. Great supporting cast all-around. All in all, it was a very entertaining film, but while I completely bought into ""Batman Begins"", here I couldn't fight the feeling that Christopher Nolan was just trying too hard to wow everyone and went a little too far. I couldn't quite figure out if it was supposed to be gritty and realistic or fanciful fantasy. I certainly hope that the next installment goes back to a character-driven piece like the first one."
7841,True,"Looks like these filmmakers have done it again by delivering a sequel which surpasses the original in almost every way, just like they did with The Godfather, Shrek, Spider-Man and X-Men.Storyline: superb and well-thought out. Homicidal terrorist known as The Joker who is hired by the Mob, but gets carried away and eventually takes over the mob, all the while trying to play a destructive game with Batman (""I think you and I are destined to do this forever"".......LEGENDARY line).Characters: brilliantly-developed. Primary focus on Batman and the Joker, and later Rachel and Two-Face. No more Batman as a supporting character like in Burton and Schumacher's films. It was also interesting to see a brief reference to Batman Beyond (where Dent says that Batman will soon want someone to take up his mantle), and how the Joker's claims were also horrible truths (how the public would happily sell Batman out in order to ensure their own safety, no matter how many times he protects them).An excellent masterpiece which should be followed by a third film ONLY if it is worthy of making, not another Batman Forever or Batman & Robin (then again, change of director makes a difference). The one thing I really disliked about this movie was Natasha's line: ""But this is a Democracy"". The United States of America is anything BUT a Democracy: it has been a Dictatorship ever since the start of the so-called War on Terror (I've read about these things and listened to Naomi Wolf).Apart from that stupid line, I give this film 10/10 stars. May the next film be up to expectations, and may Heath Ledger win that Oscar for Best Supporting Actor: he deserves it."
7842,True,"The Dark Knight almost got me. Brilliant performances by Christian Bale, as a increasingly troubled Bruce Wayne; Health Ledger's chilling portrayal of The Joker; Aaron Eckhart's interesting Harvey Dent; not forgetting Michael Caine as the faithful butler Alfred, and Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox becoming Bruce Wayne's conscience. There is a lot going on in The Dark Knight, and I wonder if there was too much trying to be said. After a while, the plot seemed to become disjointed, and a couple of times, I thought the movie had actually ended, when it hadn't. Not good. Then, there were a couple of plot moments which had kinda lost touch a bit with reality. Like, it became very obvious to me that there was a leak in the police department, long before it was obvious to any of the characters. But it doesn't get checked out until its too late. Overall, a good effort by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan, but guys, tighten it up, huh? Still, it could have been much worse. The Nolans should be very thankful for a very talented cast."
7843,True,"A lifelong fan of ""the Bat-man,"" I must admit that (like other ""lifers"") I've had occasion over the years to grind my molars in frustration. 1989 changed everything- for a brief while. Tim Burton and Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson and Danny DeVito showed the way. Then came two questionable entries in the series and fans found themselves, once more, on less sturdy terra firma. Those of us who had suffered through the limp-wristed television series experienced the eerie deja vu that comes from reliving an accident over and over. Limbo followed. The Big Screen remained dark. And silent. And then a faint light appeared at the end of that long, dark tunnel. The ""franchise"" was resurrected. While the operation was a success, the patient wasn't looking very well. Movement was slow, sometimes downright cumbersome. But there were signs of life. Hope. And now, finally, fanboys can unite in fanjoy. THE DARK KNIGHT, while a bit long (two and a half hours), boasts some of the greatest action yet in a Big Screen superhero story. That in itself is enough to recommend it. Never mind the simply spectacular look of the film, or the true to the very marrow performances all around or the surehanded direction. A ten on a scale of one to. Fanboys rejoice."
7844,True,"Batman has been a perfect Tabula rassa for artists in almost all media. He isn't locked into any one archetype such as his Kryptonian ally, but can perfectly reflect his time and fashions. 'The Dark Knight' is no different. What director Chris Nolan has deciphered perfectly is that Batman and the Joker are different sides of a child's rage - the rage of the outcast, the abused, the alone in the dark. In many ways the nemeses are the most in-control characters in the world of the film - like the war god and trickster gods of mythology.It is the Joker who truly kills for his sport, as Shakespeare once observed of the gods - but, when sacrifice is required, Batman is not averse to treading on lives in his pursuit of justice.Yes, Nolan has hung his story on pegs left - at various points - by 'Heat', '24' and even the 'Saw' movies, but it is an ingenuous one. Batman is the avenging angel the ""good"" people of Gotham prayed for, the Joker is the demon Gotham's underworld unwittingly summoned - both represent the potency of the unlocked child within to conjure bravery, goodness or mischief and pure evil. Dent's dilemma at the end of the film is that of the plain-sailing, smart ""jock"" who experiences a troubled adolescence, a body-horror - all of a sudden, in the middle of his perfect, adult life.'The Dark Knight' is the unspooling of the inner child in a way no other comic-book movie has dared - a perfect comment on the USA, the west and it's two-faced dilemma now."
7845,True,"I had been looking forward to The Dark Knight since the middle of 2007, and the death of Heath Ledger increased the already growing hype surrounding the film. Approaching the cinema, I decided to forget the hype, forget my own desire to watch, so I could do the film justice in my own way. I'm glad I did, as I think this is the 21st Century's best film so far, it surpasses the hype magnificently.The film centres around Batman, James Gordon and Harvey Dent's struggle against the Joker, a new criminal in Gotham City who is running riot. As the city begins to descend into chaos, our heroes begin to see what they must become in order to stop him.From the opening scene, it is clear that The Dark Knight is more about the villain than the hero. Heath Ledger is simply unbelievable as the Joker, he bristles with psychotic energy in every scene. His body language and vocal range are an inspiration and he is a truly terrifying character. As a Heath Ledger fan, my expectations were exceeded beyond belief. The real surprise was Aaron Eckheart, who was at times even more chilling as Two-Face than Ledger. Watching him slowly turn from Gotham City's white knight into an evil, vengeful monster is brilliant. Christian Bale is as good as he was in Batman Begins, and it was nice to see Maggie Gyllenhall surpass Katie Holmes. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman's performances were several levels above what they were in Batman Begins. Each actor complemented each other, and shares a common plus point with Anchorman in that it was as near as can be to perfectly cast.I think this film's main strength is it's writing. The script delivers constant high quality dialogue and some of the best twists and turns since Fight Club, and I love Fight Club. I love how Nolan adapted the characters into what worked the best, in particular the villains. The campness of the Joker and Two-Face's previous incarnations is non-existent, and would be out of place in this version of Gotham City. The Two-Face character is visceral and graphic, and Harvey Dent's fall from grace is handled brilliantly. The origins of the Joker are not shown, merely referenced by the Joker himself in some horrifyingly genius dialogue.I was blown away by The Dark Knight, it was almost perfect. The only niggle I had was that I would have liked to have seen more of Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow. This film was a fitting end to Heath Ledger's career, and the Joker is definitely the role he will be most remembered for. The must-see film of 2008."
7846,True,"I attended the movie last night in a crowded screen where everyone was literally hugging each other. Shows what advertising does for the film seen as the first one was such a undercover success. Before I start I'm not showing any disrespect to the late Heath or any other character in this film I am just presenting my opinion on why the hype didn't compare.In the first film we see Gotham presented as a dark city corrupt under the power of its Mob and this is emphasised where ever we go in the city. Almost the whole movie was shot in a sort of shroud of eeriness to represent the bad and evil around (great piece of cinematography). In DK (Dark Knight) we see the city very bright and almost looks like this bad has been rid of. Which I can believe as a good thing because as we find the city is being cleaned up by Harvey Dent. It just doesn't look like it was meant to be for that though. Oh and where was the proper Wayne Tower from the first one because as far as I can remember it was in tact when we left the first one be.Now on to characters, first Christian Bale, I think Christian is a very talented actor from seeing him in other undercover success' such as The Prestige, The Machinist and of course Batman Begins. I simply thought that we didn't see enough of him in this film, with him being the protagonist I thought we were not as close to him as in Batman Begins. It was almost as though we were watching from a different perspective all together. Maggie Gyllenhaal I've got to say I was so happy when she died in this film, I decided to give her chance when it first started but she did not suck me in to the character of Rachel Dawes like Katie Holmes did and I was disappointed to hear she had other arrangements when she was asked to appear in this. Aaron Eckhart who played Harvey Dent I thought played the villain two face a lot better than he did Dent, he seemed to make the two face character his own, like the touch Heath gave Joker. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman played their parts greatly just like they always do in any film I've ever seen, there parts fit them so well as well. Both coming out with their useful comments every now and again to help push the Dark Crusader onwards, sort of like the agony aunts of Batman. Finally coming to the late Heath Ledger I suppose seen as I could not believe that it was him under that paint that he must of done a pretty good job...I think though that some people are being (whats the word), well their opinion of the film is being blinded by his performance and his death. Gotta have a huge amount of respect for him seen as he was in Lords Of Dogtown and played his part amazingly. Great actor overall and its been a tragedy to lose him so quickly.Now to the storyline. To be honest when I heard that it was two and half hours long I was even more pumped to see it seen as I love long films. The opening bank seen I thought was really good because that is what the joker would do so was very capturing for his character, sort of settled the mood to. Then the rest of the way through the film I felt rushed without a chance to get settled down with what was going on. It felt like an episode of Cribs where the cameras just constantly in a new place (I know a bit OTT but I thought it was funny). I did like how Rachel was killed off in the middle though and not only because she was annoying but because it unravelled a good story line of two face and Bruce taking the pain of his loss and putting it on the side line. Some of the story line was very predictable which I did not enjoy and then some of it was very wild like Harvery as two face. I thought that the two face should of been the ending so that it left it in suspense for the next one. I also thought the Mob were presented as a bit of a wuss crowd in this one especially Eric Roberts who played the Falconey representative, he just seemed like a complete joke compared to Falconey in the last one. Did anyone notice the Gambler as well, they should not waste characters like they did with this plus they made him look rubbish I can always remember him as more of doing guy.Personally it might have been the hype that ruined it for me. Please don't post that missed Heath Ledger as well when you didn't know him. This is why I feel it wasn't great if you agree with some of the ideas I posted, post it as helpful if you think I didn't present anything good vote unhelpful...Thanks For Your Time and as if Anthony Michael Hall was in it I didn't realise it was him!"
7847,True,"First of all, if you are looking for a movie that is nothing but plot less explosions and fights, don't see this movie. It has more depth and character study than I thought any superhero movie could have.But this is no ordinary superhero movie. It pulls you in and doesn't let you out until the end. Christian Bale plays Batman excellently, and we see how he is, unfortunately, inspiring criminals in Gotham. From the part in the movie when the Joker comes in, Gotham descends into hell.And as for the Joker, Heath Ledger did a phenomenal job as him. His voice, the way he licked his lips, just everything about him is unbelievably flawless. Ledger does the best job at portraying a sadistic psychopath that I've ever seen. I would definitely recommend he gets an Oscar for this work.Aaron Eckhart does a great job as Harvey Dent/Two Face. I thought it was brilliant how he played a very good person for the first part of the film, and then just goes crazy when Rachel Dowes is killed.Great acting, brilliant characterization, and a lot of dark events make this a great movie that lives up to its hype and its name. This truly is a dark movie. All in all though, it is phenomenal.10/10"
7848,True,"There are so many comments to hear about performance death-matches of Jack Nicholson vs. Heath Ledger(R.I.P.) and Burton's fantasy fueled Gothic Gotham vs. Nolan's darkness empire of Gotham but before you watch the movie, please erase all of your biases ladies and gentlemen as you are about to see a true masterpiece. My vote for the movie is 10/10 and I would like to let you know why. There are some non-realistic spots on the scripts, some familiar scenes and quotes where you have seen over and over again before and the instantaneous waste of the powerful Harvey Dent (Two Face) figure that we could have seen the true extent of his evolution in a separate work. These could lower the quality of this kind of a 185 million dollar movie unless you see some aces to block your view and attract your attention to somewhere else. Luckily we have the supreme display of the Gotham City where chaos is the only rule and the unforgettable/unbelievable Joker portrait, performed -I am sorry not performed, lived- by Heath Ledger. In this movie, the Joker is not performed by Heath Ledger, he is performed by the Joker himself and you will agree with me when you see how Heath Ledger evolved into the Joker. You will see great acting, amazing effects, fine editing and a perfect display of Batman to satisfy your expectations but what you will feel is possibly the best acting performance ever (Joker/Heath Ledger) in your every shaking cell of your shaking body. Watch this movie at night and in a depressed mode if possible, to see fear chase you when chaos is in your head and Joker coming towards you when you are on your way home. A pure 10/10."
7849,True,brilliant i have seen batman begins and though that was the best batman film but i suppose i have been proved wrong heath ledger is amazing i love how he makes that pencil disappear you will have to watch that and i have seen godfather and i am only able to watch it for say half an hour because it is so boring and dull and old i think the dark knight deserves 1# spot on the top 250 list its time for a film to take that prize for being brilliant and people bash the dark knight because heath ledger died after it finished and they said that they were using it as publicity those people who liked heath ledger enough to see his last piece of work would have seen it anyway if he had been alive and most people went to see it because they wanted to see if Mr Nolan could follow up batman begins and i think he did an amazing job with it and it is not yet seen whether there will be a third but well have to see if he wants to try and break more box office records I'm sure that it could be done
7850,True,"SPOILER ALERTI can't believe you people that actually says that this is overrated. It's definitely NOT overrated. It's a masterpiece and surpasses great films like The Godfather and The Shawskank Redemption in many ways. I have never been so affected and involved in a movie before. This movie takes you right in to the action and you can really feel how corrupt the city is. And the characters are so awesome. The Joker is probably the best character ever in a movie. He is just so damn sick and crazy, but still funny. The dark humor that he uses is sometimes extremely fun. I almost laughed my ass off a few times, like when he used that pen trick, and when he tricked everyone of his partners in the first robbery, but the most hilarious scene with The Joker is when he is dressed up as a nurse and the walks out and blows the hospital to pieces. The whole scene with The Joker and all the gangsters is also very well made. I also liked the explanation he had about himself. ""A dog that are running after cars"". Also Harvey Dent/Two-Face was really impressive. I really liked that character. In one scene in the movie he said; ""Either you die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain"". That dialog kind of described Harveys role in the movie in a way. He was a hero as Harvey and manage to caught several gangsters, and then when Rachel died, he wanted revenge and became Two-Face. His downfall also bring-ed a message to the movie. All the other characters where also really great. Actually, most of the characters in this movie would actually fit in to a Top 30 list of best movie characters. The whole movie also felt very realistic. It felt like they had a good explanation about everything that happened in the movie. Also the story was epic. No more said about that, it was just epic. Two heroes trying to bring hope to Gotham City in there own different ways, while they at the same time gets distracted from a crazy villain that likes chaos and anarchy. So I must say that this is actually the best movie ever made. There are just some of you that just don't want to see a comic-book based movie to be the best of all.This is a big masterpiece and it deserves it's position. Us people actually voted it up there, which kind of means that most people thought that this movie was awesome."
7851,True,"If only I could give this 11/10 I'd do it. I've never been much of a fan of Batman, but Bale pulls of his performance as The Dark Knight spectacularly. Heath Ledger is the real star though. His masterful performance as the Joker is unmatched. He makes the Joker both completely hilarious and absolutely terrifying. No one else can ever touch this role again without it being an insult to Heath's name. I'm dead serious with this one. Ledger IS the Joker.The tone has definitely taken a darker turn. Particularly the ending, with Batman accused of murder and all, and the destruction of the Bat signal, I can only hope that things go better for the bat next movie. I can't see how this movie can possibly be topped by a sequel. All in all, you need to go see it. Definitely go see this one."
7852,True,"Oh my god! Was all I had to say after I saw ""The Dark Knight"" on opening day. It was one of the best story lines I had seen in a long time, and that is what made the movie so great! The fact that it had a strong plot along with all the action and remarkable performances by the whole cast just made this the greatest movie ever in my opinion! Since that Friday when I first saw it, I've seen it a total of three times and would be completely willing to go back several more times! It is officially my favorite movie. Christian Bale did an amazing job adding more depth to his character, Bruce Wayne/Batman. Of course I also give credit where due, the writers did a phenomenal job writing this but the actors took it to another level and really immersed themselves in their roles. Heath Ledgers performance left me speechless, when ever the joker laughed, I literally got goose bumps. Two thumbs way up!!!"
7853,True,"Little really can need to be said about this movie that has not been already said before.Bale as Batman is exceptional as we all knew he was going to be (again!). He not only plays the side of Batman quite darkly and mysterious but also give Bruce Wayne that slightly arrogant charm which is originally the way Bruce was said to be. Heath Ledger pretty much did as everyone said he would and stole the show in his deranged, psychotic and immensely breathtaking performance as the joker. Slight touches such as the dryness of his mouth when talking and also the constant licking of the lips along with slight twitches of the head just made you want to see more and more of him through out the film. Aaron Eckhart and Maggie Gylenhall are excellent together and Im looking forward to seeing more from Eckhart, he puts in a solid performance as Harvey Dent and really shows his acting capabilities in the last half hour of the movie! All in all This is a must see for everyone, not just Batman fans and I can certainly promise you will not be disappointed, well I'm off to see it again for the 3rd time in 2 days. :P"
7854,True,"Where to begin? Well probably with Batman Begins' last scene and a Joker playing card. From this moment on, most fanboys (and I include myself amongst this number) have been frothing at the mouth at the prospect of a sequel. Three years later, Christopher Nolan and his brother, have delivered a script, and Nolan has helmed a film which transcends the limitations of the genre that it is nominally in.From the opening scene of a daring bank robbery executed in broad daylight, introducing us to the Joker, which was obviously inspired by Michael Mann's Heat, to the unexpected and dark ending, the film is relentlessly paced and never lets up. Whilst there are small touched of humour here and there in the film, primarily supplied by Alfred (played with a deft touch by Michael Caine) and the Joker (in an iconic performance by Heath Ledger, more of which later).For those wanting nothing more than a rattling good ""superhero movie"", there are more than enough action set pieces, as Nolan has become more assured behind the camera shooting action, but there is so much more here than simple action.The main story arc of the film is Harvey Dent's (played by a very good Aaron Eckhart), whose descend from grace informs the action. Gary Oldman is wonderful as ""everyman"" Jim Gordon, one of the few good policemen in a corrupt force, and the rest of the cast is very good, including Maggie Gyllenhall as Rachel Dawes.But the strength of the film is carried on the backs of the two primary characters, Heath Ledger's Joker, a sado-masochistic, psychotic, sociopathic killer with no limits, no boundaries, no rules and Christian Bale's Batman for whom structure and order are all.Its a huge shame that Ledger will never get a chance to reprise the role, since in my opinion it is destined to become iconic, like Vader or Lector. But Bale's turn as both Bruce Wayne and Batman is excellent as well, and he fully makes us believe in Batman.The dialogue is often witty and intelligent, and always serves to drive the plot forward, without sacrificing character development for any of the major characters along the way. So far I have only seen the film once, but am planning to go again today.Its difficult to call a film a classic of its type or a masterpiece so quickly after the film's original release. However, if I was tempted to do so, this would be one of the very very few films I would consider calling a classic, and perhaps even a masterpiece...."
7855,True,"When Heath Ledger was first cast as the Joker, I, like many others, had raised my eyebrows to say the least, as he was on very few of the multitudes of lists of actors that people were saying who should play the Joker.I'm happy to say that I didn't bash the choice, like many others did. Having been a huge fan of Batman Begins, I had faith in Christopher Nolan and the vision he had for The Dark Knight. I was quite curious to see how Ledger would do. I wasn't surprised he did well. I was surprised at how he hit a grand slam with this performance. Wow! I did not see Ledger at all in this movie - I only saw the Joker. I doubt I will be able to ever watch the 89 Batman with Jack Nicholson again. Ledger's Joker puts all the rest of the Joker incarnations to shame. He hits all the right notes of the character - his insanity, his twisted view on life, his doing things for no real reason, but just to do it. His relationship with Batman is extremely true to the comics thanks to the brilliance of the screenplay and Ledger. The interrogation scene in the police station and the dialogue between Batman and the Joker near the end are highlights. This was a very well defined rendition of the Joker that will be extremely difficult to top. Ledger's performance alone will make this movie extremely rewatchable.Then there's Aaron Eckhart and the character of Harvey Dent/Two-Face, a character that had yet to be fully realized in a Batman movie (Batman Forever did not do the character justice, no pun intended, at all). Finally, we get a very well realized character arc, a tragic tale of the white knight, Harvey Dent, an honorable man destined for a tragic downfall. Thank you Christopher Nolan for finally delivering a worthy tale of the tragic character Dent. Aaron Eckhart was fabulous. I always liked him as an actor, but I think this has been his finest performance yet. He makes Dent a very likable person who you hate seeing go through what he goes through over the course of the movie. His transition into Two-Face is very well done, very believable. They establish many of the traits that would go into that personality very well at the beginning. The way they incorporate the coin was well executed.Christian Bale is good once again as Batman. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are their usually reliable selves, bringing nice comic relief at points. A welcome cameo by Cillian Murphy adds a nice touch and I thought Eric Roberts actually did quite well as mob boss Sal Maroni, who deals with the Joker, but not completely happy about having to do so.This was a two and a half hour movie, but it moves fast. The interweaving of the story lines, particularly with the Joker and Dent was impressively done. The strength of the movie is the strong story and memorable characters. I'd highly recommend it. One of the movies that actually lives up to the hype."
7856,True,"This is not a ""superhero movie"". That term has become something of a stigma in recent years, commonly attached to miserable excuses for movies like Spiderman-3, Blade Trinity or...Dear God..Ghost Rider. The brother's Nolan are in the FILM business (that is to say, true art on the moving canvas)and in The Dark Knight they bring all their film noir splendor and genius storytelling ability into the realm of comic mythology. This movie is absolutely dazzling and while it demands a great deal from its viewers, it gives so much in return.The action sequences are mind blowing, their delivery expert and the realism bursts through the seams. Bale cements himself as the ideal Batman, he is brooding and immensely intimidating. Say want you want about the voice, etc. his almost malevolent presence as Batman helps to further distinguish the very real differences between Batman and Bruce Wayne. In either sense, both are tortured individuals seeking truth and a clear path to reason in a chaotic, disassembled world and he triumphs at making us believe that they're two entirely separate individuals.Ledger...is...classic. There's not a whole lot I can say that hasn't already been said about his performance as the Joker. His clown's ineptitude for logic or sympathy is so believable you'll be looking over your shoulder walking home. Sadist, Narcissist, Murderer...the nouns, adjectives and superlatives to describe his take on the once camped-out Clown-prince are inexhaustible and in some strange way it seems as though he HAD to end with this role, how else could he have ever topped it? Jack Nicholson? He's got The Shining, this one goes to Ledger with king-like propriety. This is the cackling face of unadulterated evil.The rest of the cast lives up to their street credit in every dynamic. They're not given too much to do, yet it seems like their screen times are just perfect. Between Gordon, Alfred and Fox, virtue is actually made engrossing. Maggie Gyllenhal, steps in for Katie Holmes and did what we wanted her to do in Batman Begins. She acts the perfect part as the wedge between Harvey Dent and Bruce Wayne, and while she delivers plenty in veracity she never quite stops being vulnerable. Lastly, Aaron Eckhart plays, perhaps, the most tortured of the lot. His Harvey Dent is so awash in irrevocable good, that his descent into becoming Two-Face is so intensely painful. Unlike Tommy Lee Jones (though the fault essentially rests with Schumaker), This take on Two-Face is unmistakably human and presents us with the bitter fruits of life's travesties. Eckhart is the closest thing in this film to a figure of Greek tragedy and instead of receiving our disdain, he becomes a figure of martyrdom.The greatness of this film isn't determinable by the measure of its ethical questions and the limits of one's values, nor is it the crisp, almost dreamlike landscape of Gotham where Batman either soars or crashes through, it's the mixture of these two important mediums. Christopher Nolan and co. have dared greatness in a genre that, based on accepted belief, hasn't the facility to do so. This movie is beautifully dark, and proof of something largely visionary at work in the world of Batman. And whether its the Joker spitting his hell-fire canticle of anarchy, Batman cutting through the azure night sky or Alfred waxing philosophical, this movie will stick with you long after you've left the theater and trust me, this film has changed a great many things."
7857,True,"Ever since i saw batman begins, i came onto IMDb and saw this movie in pre-production and love it already. The story transcended your ordinary superhero tale. If you didn't understand what was going on, or didn't get the frequent cuts between simultaneous plot lines, go see the movie again with a friend that understood it because you really did miss out on some great stuff. Like the fact that batman cannot kill the joker because it will break his moral code. So the joker keeps tempting him, like how he is laughing when he gets beaten up in the interrogation room and thrown off the building, because he believes that by getting batman to kill him he has turned him to the side of corruption and evil, just as he has done to harvy dent....stuff like that. As for all of the people complaining about batman not getting enough screen time, if they cut back on any of the other characters the movie would have to be a nice 4 hours to convey all of the storyline. And people would cry about Heath not being in every other shot. The soundtrack was amazing, Zimmer wows us for the millionth time :D Heath wasn't even in this movie, I was watching the Joker the whole time. There is going to be a massive wave of superhero movies in the very near future, and this is only the beginning."
7858,True,"The Dark Knight was the first movie I've ever seen on the day it opened. I wanted to see the film since I first heard about it. But after seeing the trailer for the movie, I couldn't wait.When I saw the trailer for Spiderman 3, I thought it would be the greatest movie ever. Spiderman 3 was a good movie, but it was nowhere near the greatest movie ever. I gave it a 6/10. I was so disappointed.When I saw the trailer for The Dark Knight, I thought it would be the greatest movie ever, too. I hoped that it wouldn't turn out to be a disappointment like Spiderman 3. But in the weeks before the movie opened, I stopped thinking that would happen because of all the hype. The movie's expectations were too high for it to turn out to be a disappointment.And I was right. It's not only the first movie I've seen on the day it opened, it will also be the first movie I've seen more than once in theaters. It is without a doubt the best comic book movie ever. It wasn't the best movie ever. Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith and The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King are hard to beat. So I rank it as the third best movie ever.The day after I saw it I noticed that it was on the top 250 list. I figured it would be in like the twenties but I thought it was a mistake when it said #1! So I clicked onto the top 250 list and there it was sitting right above The Godfather. I couldn't believe it and I was so happy that something finally replaced The Godfather as #1. I don't think that The Godfather is a really good movie.So anyway, the movie has been criticized for its length. It is a very long movie, but the action is balanced throughout the film. Its not like some longs movies where there's a few short action scenes and long stretches of boring scenes. The movie is action-packed.Heath Ledger's Oscar-worthy performance as The Joker is disturbingly incredible. The Joker is the most ruthless comic book movie villain ever. I can't believe that such a menacing character could be so humorous. The Joker will have you laughing as well as frightened. Also, the movie is very dark. I wouldn't bring kids to see it. There are several intense and violent scenes in the film.There is only one thing I didn't like about the movie. I believe that Katie Holmes did a better job of portraying Rachel Dawes than Maggie Gyllenhaal. There was nothing wrong with her performance; it was great. Its just that Katie Holmes is Rachel Dawes. Maggie Gyllenhaal isn't. I kept forgetting that Maggie Gyllenhaal was Rachel Dawes. Its like having Amber Heard play Megan Fox's character in the next Transformers movie. Its not the same. Also, I expected Two-Face to live on to be the villain in the next movie.The Dark Knight is the best film of the year by far. Its not just the best comic book movie ever, but one of the best movies ever made. I give it a 10/10. I can't believe that there are people who don't like it. Its been a while since I've seen a sequel that surpassed the original. Can't wait to see the next one!"
7859,True,"This film went beyond my expectations! The Nolans have taken the Batman story to a new level. Some won't like it because the film is EXTREMELY dark and gritty, and I highly recommend that children not see this movie, but it is a true masterpiece.All of the acting is great, but Heath Ledger was amazing! The hype is true for once, and the man's performance as the Joker is one of the most impressive that you will ever see. I have never been a Heath Ledger fan, the guy had never been in any films of my interest, so I'm not saying this just because his recent and tragic passing. He steals the show.The Joker is so sadistic, he manages to be both terrifying and, at times, humorous. The rest of the cast does an amazing performance, and the writing and directing are second to none. Go and see this movie!"
7860,True,"After 2 hours and 32 minutes, what can only be described as an Absolutely Entertaining Blockbuster of Film making ,Director Christopher Nolan delivers an Epic movie ! The Joker, the late (Heath Ledger), as the Archtypical Anarchist, in a performance that can only be described as , well there are no words that can accurately capture this Unique, Inventive, and Captivating Dynamo of the Silver Screen ! The Joker intent on running and profiting on Gotham Citys illegal operations, vows to take on the Batman and eliminate him , and anyone who opposes him ! Batman/Bruce Wayne( Christian Bale), is struggling with his alter ego identity, and considers stepping down from his hero role, and let the up and coming D.A., Harvey Dent(Aaron Eckhart) , shut the illegal operations, and jail the Biggest of the Criminals. Well, things don't always work out that way, and the Joker declares war on Gotham City.Using every trick in the book, The Joker kills everyone who opposes him, or who he needs as a tool for another victim. There are plot gaps, but this movie is so well made, I'll overlook them, Alfred the Butler(Michael Caine) finally gives the character the the energy he deserves, and it plays very well.Great casting , Great Professional Actors ! Christian Bale gives another good performance, the suit does allot of the work, but he is the Batman !Gary Oldman another fine performance as Jim Gordon. Rachel Dawes(Maggie Gyllenhaal) is delightful and easy on the eyes... See it in IMAX if you can, the photography is Breathtaking, in Chicago and Hong Kong, just terrific !More bad people than you can shake a stick at, the Joker manages to blur the line between survival and human decency, but , only for awhile.Warner Brothers will need to find another villain, NO one can equal or surpass Ledger's Manical Joker, which begs the question, who are the losers, all of his fans to be.....This film works, it is a 10 !Limited special effects, maybe George Lucas will get the message...."
7861,True,"Cons: Since when did Batman talk like Cookie Monster? I couldn't even understand what Bale was saying half of the time. Seriously, there's a difference between hiding your real voice and Cannibal Corpse try-outs. The plot was terrible, and they ""modernized"" Gotham City. Sonar and Cell Phones, now he can see like a BAT! Really? They didn't even show how and why he could see in the dark using the ""pre-made"" sonar capable bat mask. You've GOT to be kidding! Then there's the ending, which seemed to me like a huge rush of different movie clips they had saved for outtakes and random lines that, absolutely, had no real meaning, just sentence fragments of what has happened and what will happen. Batman isn't supposed to be looked at like a cop killer, which is what the ending basically insinuated. They ruined Batman, and our culture is eating this crap movie up like imported chocolate.Pros: I did, on the other hand, love how Christopher Nolan hardly used any CGI in the film, which brought realism to the action sequences. CGI is ruining films and it's great to finally watch one with ""real"" objects being destroyed. The only great thing this movie had going for it was Heath Ledger by a long shot, he carried and stole the show in every aspect. At times, he reminded me of Brandon Lee. Truly Epic.R.I.P."
7862,True,"Heath Ledger, like James Dean, had the misfortune to die before his talents could be truly appreciated on the big screen. In the case of Dean, only one of his three great roles appeared before his untimely death. While he was a bit more prolific, Ledger's greatest work is only now being comprehended by film-goers. His larger-than-life genesis of The Joker can only be described as legendary. I believe it will stand the test of time as the definitive portrayal of Batman's true nemesis. Sadly, this will likely mean no more Joker in Christopher Nolan's franchise.Making the creative choice of minimal make-up, unkempt appearance, and no back-story, Ledger, with Nolan, births a Joker whose pathology is genuine, whose menace is as oppressive a part of the dark canvas as the cityscape of Gotham, and is yet tempered with a child-like, and infectious sense of play. Early in the film, his ""magic trick,"" in which he makes a pencil disappear, had a packed, noontime audience at the Hollywood Arclight theatre howling. And every appearance after that simply built upon the audience's relish. Throw in a perfect Joker cackle, and Heath secures eternal identification with this role. It sits on the mantle proudly as his best work. It's also the best Batman film ever, bar none. Ledger's phenomenal performance in no way eclipses the flawless work of the other world- class actors sharing the screen, most notably Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two-Face. It helps their talents in no small measure to have a powerful, intelligent and unpretentious script.To briefly digress: We in America (or at least our media) tend to get stuck in our ways -- ""oldies radio"" still plays the same 100 songs they have played for the last 30 years; even on satellite TV, there is nothing good on during the day; and souvenir shop windows on Hollywood Boulevard are still full up with James Dean, Marilyn and Elvis. But there are decades worth of performers who are more than pretenders to the Mount Rushmore of talent the above three always seem to monopolize. Forget that many of the best crop of actors in the 21st century are British, or from one of the other colonies. It IS a new century after all, and a global culture, and while it still behooves many Americans to have home- grown deceased icons of stage, screen and jukebox they can display in velvet over their mantelpieces next to Dale Earnhardt, it's just not realistic. Most people under the age of forty have never seen ""Giant,"" or ""Viva Las Vegas"". This in no way deflates the star power or the accomplishments of the Holy Trinity. But aside from his ""dreamy"" voice and classic (or classical) records - which at this point in history belong in a bin next to Pavarotti, rather than PIL - Elvis Presley did not earn his Christ-like status through much more than charisma and chutzpah. Hold any of his films (with the possible exception of ""Jailhouse Rock"") up against ""The Dark Knight"". Go ahead. Do it. I'm getting some TNT and a crew up there on Hollywood's Mount Rushmore. I'll rappel down the face myself and carve out a NEW row of icons, for the new Millennium.On the basis of his body of work, capped so beautifully by his portrayal of the Joker, Heath Ledger deserves some consideration -- in my humble opinion -- for a spot on the hill."
7863,True,"I had so much hype for this film and have always loved batman growing up i thought for sure this would be a 10 out of 10 film. but i gave it a 9 out of 10 after i had seen it. there just was a couple things i thought could have been better. (don't get me wrong this film will be a classic!) but i wasn't a fan of the editing that much, especially on the fight scenes when watching it sometimes i'd be thinking what batman actually did to that henchman. this kind of reminded me a bit of spiderman 3 how they tried to fit so much into one movie that you get a lot of information to fast that you cant really relax you have to be watching whats going on the whole time it would be alright i guess if the film wasn't 2hrs and 50 minutes i had to pee so bad after leaving that film. and the music was sweet but i felt that the whole 2hrs 50 minutes of straight Hans Zimmer going at it got a little tiring( i felt the film didn't have any slow scenes really so Hans is just blasting away the orchestra at you the whole time!). but other than that the film was a massive epic superhero movie that is my 1# fav comic book film. i loved the storyline of Joker and what he was trying to accomplish it was just magnificent. the scene stealer of the movie is when joker is driving the truck and Batman's on the motorcycle just MASSIVE! if you haven't seen it go now lets make sure there's more to come. (I'd suggest a drive in or a theater with a comfortable seat cause this is a long film.)"
7864,True,"***May Contain Spoilers*** Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is amazing for a few reasons but not limited to the ones below.1. The Joker is amazing! I've been waiting for a Joker like the one portrayed in the film for a long time. Hats off to the writers and Heath Ledger for delivering how the Joker should be. The Joker is supposed to be a psychopath, plain and simple. The Joker has no morals and wont think twice about killing someone and laughing about it. He's supposed to be a dark and mysterious character as well. When people complain that ""we get no back story on how he became Joker, no name, no motive, Its supposed to be that way. It creates tension and frustration for Batman because he will never know who he is. Joker can find out that Batman is Bruse Wayne, hurt his friends, break him down physically, morally and emotionally and above all kill Batman. The only thing Batman can do is kill Joker, and we all know that wont happen. The Joker is the opposite of Batman in every way, and for this intense version of batman he needs an equally intense villain.2. Making Chicago Gotham City was one of the best parts of this film, it establishes a tone that this isn't fake or superficial. To put Batman in reality does a lot for the characters in the movie. It makes them grounded and easier to relate to and understand. Thats why people can relate better to Batman then lets say Superman or Greenlantern. In the Joker's case, in his origin he was knocked into a chemical tank and his skin was bleached white, hair turned green and his lips red but the writers of this movie changed it, in my opinion to once again make people believe this can happen, to make it grounded and not based in science fiction.""The Dark Knight"" is a great Batman movie, comic book movie and action film and stays true to what Bob Cane had envisioned for his creation. No ""pow"" ""zap"" and ""wham"" here, just a movie that makes you think.The Dark Knight: 10/10"
7865,True,"This movie surpasses the hype and is truly the best movie of the year. It is not, however, the best movie ever made, despite the #1 ranking of it. It was way better than Batman Begins (Liked it but didn't love it. The Bad guy just sucked really bad). I went into this movie half thinking it would suck, because my lack of interest in Batman Begins. Half of me thought it would rock, because the parts of the trailer with Heath Ledger in them looked cool. It ended up being awesome. Heath Ledger did something I thought to be impossible. He really and truly became the better joker over Nickleson (sp?). Now that I've seen Ledger's performance, I don't see how he couldn't surpass Jack. Anyhoo... I think that it would have made it into my top five list of movies if I had seen less of Bale and more of Ledger. Don't get me wrong. Christian Bale is a great actor. Heath is just better. It is definitely in my top 10 list of movies though. It is also, in my opinion the best superhero movie ever made. My top ten list consists of the following movies and a few series of movies1. Lord of the Rings, 2. Star Wars, 3. Sweeney Todd, 4. Harry Potter 5. Monty Python and the Holy Grail, 6. Pirates of the Caribbean, 7. Indiana Jones, 8. The Dark Knight (Not Batman Begins), 9. The Matrix, 10.Monty Python: Life of Brian"
7866,True,"As people standing on the outside, it is very easy for us to praise or denounce another artists work. We have the luxury of imaginations, with which budget and limitations hold no sway. So, I stand here with the predicament of trying to stand out from a braying crowd, and going with what I feel.This film is not perfect, nor is it the end all be all film. A few minor transgressions, which have been beat to death by those who have rated it before me, do lay fault to the film. However, this is a brilliant film that will stand the test of time.As a follow up to a phenomenal Batman Begins, the crew found themselves in a unique position. They had been granted silent permission to rewrite the Batman mythos. Instead of trying to maintain the feel from the first movie, which is the fault of most sequels, the Nolan brothers and co. bravely took the film to new depths. The dark, menacing overtone through out the film allows for the actions of the main characters to really effect the audience. The wanton violence, while it may be distasteful for some, is brutal and unrelenting. But, this brings a certain emotional high to the film. The Joker's maniacal and malicious plot leaves the audience uncomfortable, as it should.The individual roles bring together an amazing cast that mirrors the intent of the movie so well. Bale has always been excellent at playing tortured roles, as evidenced in Equilibrium, American Psycho and the Machinist. Here, he is given a playground to explore this tension as only a Hollywood blockbuster can provide. Aaron Eckhart plays his role to a T. You are torn in both directions when his character falls. You feel for his rage and realizes he wanted to sacrifice himself, yet you cannot condone his actions. His descent into madness is both heart wrenching and horrifying at the same time. The supporting cast does not play their roles as such. Each person puts an honest soul into what could have been cardboard, cut out roles. Bravo to the cast.But, to the late Heath Ledger, my hat is off to you. This role exemplifies what he had to offer to the cinema industry. His roles up till this one were no more edgy than the rebel from a teen movie. Most of the time, he relied on his looks and charm to carry his character. But here, here is a masterpiece in method acting. The lack of back story adds to the menace, as he even gives multiple stories himself. His complete lack of goal, which is a goal in itself, is so unnerving. We're used to a tortured villain out for revenge for the lost of a loved one. But, here is a wanton psychopath that is destined to go down in the annals of cinema history as one of the definitive villains.If you have read until this point, I thank you. This movie is a modern masterpiece, that explores the duality of society from multiple facets, and has left me speechless. This is not for everyone. The violence in this movie is brutal and unsettling. For the Joker, there is little context to his actions, as it forces the hero to stand firm in his beliefs. THIS IS NOT A KIDS MOVIE. Yet, in a world where movies are becoming souless, this movie took a brave step in a risky direction. Bravo, ladies and gentlemen of the Dark night. You are now part of the gilded guardians of cinema."
7867,True,"Batman : The Dark night is truly dark, and excellent. Heath, whom unfortunately isn't among us any more played an excellent joker, and truly showed the insanity of the joker. His performance was truly believable and truly insane. Meaning that you can really tell that he was right for the part, and was into his roll as the joker. The joker in this film is much better then in the original batman, and gives you the true sense of just how insane the joker really is. And two-face, whom does have an appearance in this movie also had a great performance. And I was happy with his appearance since it wasn't like spider-man 3 were you see Venon, and then he is just thrown away. So it was great to see this character come into the movie and actually have screen time for you to enjoy the character that he has become. Aside from performances, the movie itself was excellent, and I would say that it is truly, worth it. This movie lived up to it's hype, and I am glad to have seen it opening night."
7868,True,"Let me start with this statement: This is the greatest comic/superhero movie adaption ever to be achieved to date. I have been keeping up with every update on this film since is saw ""Batman Begins"". Let me tell you that this film was everything that I could have hope for.""Begins"" gave audiences a relatible Batman(Bruce Wayne)that everybody could understood and could cheer for. We also saw an interesting and realistic take on Gotham City and characters such as James Gordon, Alferd Pennyworth and Lucios Fox. We got to know these characters and settings to the point were audiences wanted to see more.Director Christopher Nolan and his crew gave audiences and fans more than an excellent film but literally quite a masterpiece. ""The Dark Knight"" ranks with sequels such as ""The Godfather: Part 2"" and ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"". This film contains intelligence and genus in all directions. Christorpher Nolan was born to created these two batman films; Christan Bale once again plays Batman like he actually is Bruce Wayne; but the most talked about and hyped up character of this film is of course The Joker. The late Health Leger give us a funny, evil and psychotic Joker that no one has ever scene before. Leger's performance is brilliantly played and is very Oscar worthy. Through out my viewing of this show, i was anticipating every scene that included the Joker. Health Ledger and The Joker mixed together in this film like Anthoney Hopkins and Hanibal Lector did; his performance was humorous but creepy at the same time.The introduction of Harvey Dent(played by Aaron Echart) in this film was interesting. It shows how Dent is driven by love and compassion for helping people and how he is driven to the point were he snaps and become sometime completely different. A very pleasing performance done by Aaron Echart is believable in a every aspect.""The Dark Knight"" proves that even a Batman movie can break box office records and go down in cinematic history. I give Cristopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" a solid 10/10"
