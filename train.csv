4361,True,"Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint."
4362,True,"The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for ""gangster movies"", but its influence goes well beyond that.The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every ""organized crime film"" nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination.But to say that The Godfather is simply ""influential"" is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as ""a movie about gangsters"". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years.The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing.To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his ""innocence"" and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an expos√© of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends."
4363,True,"This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on alot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family.This is definetely a ""must see"" masterpiece."
4364,True,"""The Godfather"" simply put, is one of the greatest films of all time. The script is thee best I've ever read. The direction is flawless. The acting may very well have the best ensemble cast in any movie I've ever seen or will ever see. It's also one of the most precise and intricate films I've ever come across as writer, Mario Puzo brings out some of the most hidden and guarded secrets of the underground world ever captured on film. Watching ""The Godfather,"" is like watching cinematic art. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is what brings this film, that's so ambitious and so grand, down to earth with precision direction as he handles each and every scene with such care. The film starts with a black screen and an opening monologue from an undertaker. As the man starts talking about honor, family, respect, and justice we are pulled right in on his luminous eyes as he stands in near darkness. He begs for justice since the American system has failed him. He goes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) for justice. Don Vito is the man of power. He's the one who pulls all the strings and watches his puppets dance from behind the stage and out of sight; untouchable, or so we think. Some of the greatest moments in the film- and very intentional to show the distinguishable difference between Michael and Vito- are of Vito crying over his son, Sonny's (James Caan), death. When Michael learns of the news, he has little reaction. Two of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the film are from the cause of a loved one that has died long before he should have, and they come from Brando. As Vito stands over the body of his son he nearly breaks down. There is clash of feelings between the two men that are never conflicting, but compared. The film opens during the wedding of Don Vito' daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), and we see just how strong the bond of family really is. You have the family dancing with each other, drinking, laughing, and sitting next to each other to show how close they are, then we see some of the outsiders such as the Barzini family, and surprisingly Michael (Al Pacino) along with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) on the outskirts without much interaction. Michael seems almost out of place as if he is the adopted son and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is more apart of the family than he is. His opening words are to Kay, and they include, ""That's my family, Kay. That's not me."" We get the feeling that Michael's nearly ashamed of the stigma that goes along with his last name: This is what makes Al Pacino' role- significantly- the hardest performance in the entire film to portray. He's the one doing all the heavy lifting as he has to go from outsider and completely against the family's actions and businesses to, by films end, head of the family. Brando has the teary eyed moments that actors live for, but Michael is too cold for that. Never for a second as he gradually comes to power do we think this turn is ridiculous or laughable, and in lesser hands it very easily could have been. The final act of the film is loaded with plot points as decisions are made left and right as the film becomes visually and emotionally captivating. As the film draws to an end, Michael has gained half of the power of the family and makes most of the decisions. He's treated, not with respect, but as an outsider, too high ranking for his experience. The Corleone family is on the brink of disaster and losing everything, yet we never get that feeling. We see the two leader's confidence and we keep our confidence in them, even if the other family members doubt their decisions. Michael goes to Las Vegas and makes Moe Greene an offer he can't refuse. Then he refuses. This is Pacino' shinning moment in the film. There's no screaming or the hoopla that goes along with his name. After he treats Moe Greene like utter garbage, Fredo (John Cazale) get's upset and starts barking at him. Coppola is perfectly on his game here, too, as we watch from Fredo's height, looking down on Michael who sits in a chair as he coldly looks up with his radiating eyes, that have so much going on behind them, and simply says, ""Fredo, don't ever take sides with anyone against family again. Ever.""That's some serious foreshadowing for the second film, and only after watching the second film can you go back and appreciate what Pacino and Coppola pulled off in this scene; Cazale too. We have no idea how serious Michael is. These are some of the stepping stones that make Michael's change believable. He's not quite his father- Vito has a soft spot for his children (admittedly so)- as he's capable of turning on anyone and using the line, ""It's strictly business"" when it comes to family issues. Michael's sister, Connie, calls him a ""cold hearted bastard"" at the end of the film. It's hard to find better superlatives than that, yet we still love him. The interesting thing about Pacino' performance is that he doesn't sugarcoat it. He doesn't try to make the audience love him. He plays the character as the character should be played. That's the sign of great writing; great acting; and great directing since we could have very easily seen someone try to make him likable. This crew just presents the character with all his flaws and let's us decide if we love him or hate him. Its films like ""The Godfather,"" that made me wish I had amnesia, so I could feel the same heart pounding moments over and over again."
4365,True,"""The Godfather"" is a huge piece of film entertaining, involving sentiment, nostalgia, filial affection, pride, integrity, loyalty, corruption, honor, betrayal and crime... Within weeks of its release, it was clearly a blockbuster, a cinematic phenomenon, an exquisite Mafia epic with outstanding performances... Coppola got everything right, creating a landmark in American cinema...His film acutely details the inner workings of the criminal ""families,"" and the ruthlessness of those in organized crime, but also examines their steadfast loyalty, love for blood relations, and code of ethics... Coppola and Puzo subtly weave a complex narrative with themes of hypocrisy, power, and corruption which stands as a pulsating reflection of our uncertain times... With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando creates a personage that will be remembered for ever... The line ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" has reached legendary statues... Brando's Don Corleone is the moral center of the film: a tough, wise, feared old Sicilian who has risen to become an all powerful leader in an empire of Italian-American organized crime...While crime may be the first image that comes into one's mind in the film, violence plays a vital part in this complicated tale... Brando is the head of one of the five families who are said to control the Mafia in the area of New York... He is opposed to any involvement in drugs, and refuses to risk his political contacts and prestige for such putrefied money... He is behind the time but he understands that society is not alarmed by ""liquor, gambling, and even women..."" He is also a loving family man... His sons, relatives and friends are part of his operations... He despises displays of weakness... He understands the strength of power and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the ""sovereignty."" In the outdoor garden, father and son are affectionate to each other, but cannot express their emotions openly...The Corleones are a warm, close family and the motion picture (with l0 Oscar Nominations) shows the flavor of Italian-American home life... Don Corleone is an undisputed patriarch, and as played by Brando, he has almost the manner of a religious leader... His voice is quite and rasping, his chin stands as a symbol of his authority, and men kisses his hand as they ask for his favors... He is a charismatic leader and his eyes reflect his kind heart as his implacability...Pacino's gradual and subtle transformation is the heart of the film... From a gentle man to one of the most cunning, ruthless, and cold-blooded man ever to come on the screen, he has learned from his father never to talk in front of outsiders and always keep his own counsel... His commandment ""Never to take sides against the Family."" The opening shot of ""The Godfather"" sets the tone of the film as Don Corleone and some of his family listen to an undertaker, Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Cirsitto), pleading for justice for the near-rape and brutal beating suffered by his daughter...Attending the wedding of his sister Connie to young bookmaker Carlo Rizzi, Michael, a highly decorated Marine captain from World War II, points out the other guests to Kate (Diane Keaton), his non-Italian girlfriend... In the same time Coppola introduces us to his large cast of characters:Sonny (James Caan), the rough, hot-headed impulsive kid who never really grew up; Fredo (John Cazale), the troubled, shy, weak young man who can't seem to do anything right; Tom (Robert Duvall), the right-hand man, the legal adviser and adopted son to the Godfather¬ó steady, reliable, always thinking, always controlled; Connie (Talia Shire), the battered wife and rebellious sister, who achieves and promotes the movie's most horrific scene; Johnny Fontane (Al Martine), the idol star whose tears set up the shocking moment when a movie ""big shot"" named Jack Woltz (John Marley) finds himself in an horrifying pool of blood; Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana), the giant criminal thug, one of Corleone's most trusted enforcers; Tessio (Abbe Vigoda), the fearsome tall enforcer who implies the possibility of violent revenge guaranteeing Michael's safety; and Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the other faithful enforcer...With a beautiful score by Nino Rota immensely memorable, Coppola's motion picture remains a triumph, nearly perfect in its execution, composition, and impact..."
4366,True,"The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw.  Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life.  There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them.   Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime.  Its really a movie about family.  The dialogue is just unbelievable.  I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is.  The music, the acting, everything.  People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way  that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather.  The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie.   Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I'm crazy."
4367,True,"Before 'The Godfather' came out in 1972, the gangster genre, chiefly associated with Jimmy Cagney and the film noir style of the forties and fifties, had been in something of a decline. It was, therefore, a brave move for Francis Ford Coppola to attempt a three-hour epic based upon the family life of a Mafia don. The film opens in the immediate post-war period with the wedding of the daughter of Don Vito Corleone. Scenes of the wedding are intercut with scenes showing Don Vito himself in his study, granting favours and dispensing a crude form of justice as though he were an absolute monarch. We soon learn, however, that times are changing, even in the world of organised crime. Don Vito's empire has been based upon gambling, illicit liquor sales and prostitution. Other Mafia families, however, are eager for the profits to be made from drugs, and Corleone receives a proposal from a drug dealer named Sollozzo that the Corleone clan should join him in exploiting the narcotics market. Corleone refuses, ostensibly for business reasons, but it is made clear that his real objections to narcotics derive from his personal code of honour. Sollozzo, offended, orders an attempt to be made on Corleone's life. This fails, but Corleone is left seriously injured.The focus now shifts to the younger generation. Don Vito has three sons, Santino ('Sonny'), Fredo and Michael, and an adopted son, Tom Hagen. These four have contrasting characters. Sonny is hot-headed and impetuous, Fredo weak, Tom cautious and moderate. Michael, the youngest, loves his family, but initially wants to play no part in their criminal enterprises. Recently returned from the war, his ambitions are to qualify as a lawyer and to settle down in a respectable life with his Anglo-Saxon wife-to-be, Kay. The attempt on his father's life, however, persuades Michael that his first loyalty is to the family, and he agrees to be part of a revenge attack on Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey the corrupt policeman who is on his payroll. There follows a brutal cycle of revenge, as each killing is avenged by another murder. The film's emphasis on family ties, honour and vengeance recall the revengers' tragedies of the Shakespearean and Jacobean theatre. Coppola does seem to be aiming for a Shakespearean grandeur. Don Vito, the ageing monarch whose powers slip away is reminiscent of King Lear, Michael, a good man corrupted by power, of Macbeth (a comparison which will become even more apt in the later episodes of the trilogy). There is also something of Hamlet in Michael and Sonny's resolve to avenge their father. Such an ambitious film requires acting of a very high order if it is to seem credible, but Coppola was able to draw upon some of the best performances of the seventies. To my mind, this was Marlon Brando's last great role (I have never cared much for 'Apocalypse Now' and loathed 'Last Tango in Paris'), but it was one that he made the most of. His Don Vito is both terrifying and pitiable, part dictator and part lonely old man. His rasping voice (the result of an earlier bullet wound in the throat) conveys both menace and physical weakness. Don Vito may be a bad man, but he is also in a way a magnificent one, and his passing marks the end of an era. If the film was notable for the last of the great Brando, it also saw the birth of a new star. Except perhaps for 'The Godfather Part II', I have never seen Al Pacino give a better performance than he did here, as he portrayed Michael's passage from a 'civilian' (as his brother calls him) to a warlord, from an innocent young idealist to a ruthless killer. Given the length of time that Pacino is on screen, I am surprised that he was only nominated for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor. It would be interesting to speculate who might have won if he and Brando had been in competition for the award. I am even more surprised that Pacino did not win as Best Supporting Actor; Joel Grey's role in 'Cabaret' (which did win) is more showy and a technical tour de force, but it lacks the emotional depth of Pacino's performance. I also greatly admired James Caan's role as the hot-headed Sonny. This is not a perfect film; it has flaws, both artistic and ethical. Artistically, there are places where it tends to drag, particularly after the killings of Sollozzo and McCluskey, and even more so after the killing of Sonny, although it recovers at the ending, which is a highly effective piece of cinema. Ethically, I felt that the film tended to take the characters' world view too much at face value. Don Vito may be a dictator, but he is in his own eyes a benevolent dictator, a man of honour who lives by his own moral code. As others such as Roger Ebert have pointed out, this is a film which views a closed society from the inside; the only outsider is Kay, and her role is a relatively minor one. As a result, we do not get to see the damage that organised crime does to the fabric of society, and the Mafia's own view of itself is never openly challenged. That is not to say, however, that the film is totally amoral. We do see that an ethos of taking revenge can spiral out of control and lead to unforeseen consequences, to the innocent as well as the guilty. This is particularly true of the scenes where Michael takes refuge in Sicily after killing Sollozzo. The dead man's associates track him down, and a bomb meant for him instead kills his innocent young Italian wife Apollonia. Although there may be no overt condemnation of the moral position of the Mafia, there is implied criticism of its bloodier deeds. All the characters, whatever the crimes of which they may be guilty, are careful to pay lip-service to the Catholic Church and its rituals. Throughout the film (indeed, throughout the trilogy as a whole) the traditional ceremonies of the Church form a backdrop to various criminal activities. ('The Godfather' begins with a wedding and ends with a baptism). It seemed to me that Coppola was using these scenes to make an ironic contrast between the values of organised crime and those of Christianity, especially at the end of the film. Michael, already a 'godfather' in the metaphorical sense of a Mafia boss, becomes one in the literal sense of a baptismal sponsor. Shots of him taking vows on behalf of his godchild to reject the works of the devil are intercut with shots of his enemies being gunned down on his orders.Despite my reservations about this film, and although I personally would not have ranked it as my all-time favourite, there can be no denying that it is a film of great power and a milestone in the history of the cinema. 8/10"
4368,True,"Some people have called this one of the best movies of all time. I can see why they say that, although I wouldn't quite rate it that high. It does feature an interesting storyline, great acting and magnificent photography so I am not going to argue with those who place in so high, because it's understandable. It also has a memorable score.One needs to see this on a nice widescreen DVD because it's so beautifully photographed with tons of greens, grays and browns that are just beautiful. It makes me want to visit Italy. The only reason I personally didn't rate it as high as others was I didn't like any of the characters, and especially the hot-headed James Caan. When he got riddled with bullets and was done with, a la ""Bonnie & Clyde,"" that was fine with me!There isn't as much violence as people might think, if they've never seen this movie. To some, this film might be too slow, in fact. However, when the violence or something dramatic occurs it is intense and can be very brutal. Who can ever forget a guy waking up with a dead, bloody horse in his bed?!! Like a good film noir, there is a lot of tension running throughout the Godfather films. Everybody is after somebody it seems and you never know whom to trust. That's part of the downsides of living a criminal life: constant paranoia. All this is put together nicely as we become close observers of the Corleone family, its family ties and its ""business.""Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Caan, Robert DeNiro (later in the saga), Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Sterling Hayden, Richard Conte, John Cazale, Richard Castellano, on and on - quite a cast and quite a movie. I enjoyed both sequels, too.I am also fortunate to own ""The Godfather Epic"" on tape, which must be some sort of collector's item by now. It is three two-hour tapes in which Godfather I and II are sliced together and the story is presented in chronological order, instead of with all the flashbacks. It's well-done and I would have printed a review on that version, but I don't see it listed on IMDb."
4369,True,"Think epic novel crossed with Mafia speak.Imagine excellent cinematography and direction, a great musical theme, violence, tragedy, spectacle, and the family, and a cast which can't be faulted, and here you have a film which fits the bill on all counts.Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in one of his greatest roles, one which he supposedly didn't initially want to play) is the powerful Mafia Don we meet early in the film. He has three sons (Sonny - James Caan; Fredo - John Cazale; and Michael - Al Pacino) and a daughter (Talia Shire), and an adopted son (Tom Hagen - Robert Duvall). These are his beloved family and the centre of his world. His day job involves building his empire by making 'offers you can't refuse'.'The Godfather' was the first film in a trilogy following the fortunes of the Corleone family, and I think the best. It has some well-presented set pieces (Connie's wedding; Sonny's murder; Michael's killing of family enemies in the restaurant; the horse's head in the bed; and Vito's death while playing with his grand-child) and is extremely well-written. The novel itself was more soapy, a work of pulp fiction - the film pulls it together and gives it a bit more class.I particularly like the characterisations of Vito and his sons. Vito is assured in his role at the head of the premier Mafia family. Sonny is a vain libertine who is hot-headed. Fredo is a weak disappointment. Michael takes his place in the family when he has to (in fact throughout the three films he is shown to be far more ruthless than any of his relatives).Is 'The Godfather' the greatest film ever made? No, but it is one of the best. Certainly in the top 10 films of the 1970s."
4370,True,"The Godfather is not just a crime film, it's much more deeper than that. It's about loyalty, respect and more than anything, it's about family and real life. The casting in this movie is flawless. Marlon Brando as the Godfather is a perfect casting choice. He brings his unique style to his character and makes him alive. He's not just acting his role, he's living it, at least that's what it feels like. He truly deserves his Best Actor Oscar. Every scene where he is in and every line he says is emotionally touching and breathtaking, and it's not just because of his acting, but it's also because of the film's magnificent writing and directing. The storyline is outstanding. It's based on a novel written by Mario Puzo. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job with bringing his story to the screen. He really gave us the best film of all time. Brando wasn't the only one who did a wonderful job with his character, because even though Vito Corleone was the key element of the movie, the movie was still mostly about his son, Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino. You can really see his character develop during the movie, and you can feel the respect that his character has toward his father. There's a real connection between those two, even though they have a small number of scenes together. Besides Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, there were other supporting roles that were amazing as well, like James Caan as Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and of course the beautiful Diana Keaton as Kay Adams. This movie has everything. Good acting, directing, writing, cinematography and of course memorable and recognizable music by Nino Rota. In my opinion, there is only one misstep in this film, and that is the lighting in the wedding scene in the beginning of the movie. I can honestly say that this is my favorite movie and if you haven't seen it yet, you should watch it as soon as possible! 10/10 Excellent!(These are just my quick thoughts about this movie)"
4371,True,"Incredible!! With the epic soundtrack, characters, plot, casting, and directing this movie has to be considered THE best of all time. Although it is one of many Francis Ford Coppola masterpieces, this movie stands apart from the others. By telling the Corleone story from the inside of the family and mafia, viewers easily identify with and care about the characters. The cinematography is amazing too, and some of the shots and scenes from this movie can be considered the best of any movie throughout time. You can see IMDb's 9.2 rating of The Godfather and hear about the movie as often as you want, but until you experience the power of this film yourself, it will be impossible to grasp the importance of the movie to cinema. Although this movie is from the early 70s, it is by no means dated. Michael Corleone is my personal favorite character of all time, and the chance to see James Caan, Robert Duvall, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and John Cazale work together is unforgettable. Nobody could've known that Marlon Brando, with two cotton balls, would create the most famous voice in cinematic history."
4372,True,"It has been said so many times that it seems clich√©, but I wil continue to say it. The Godfather is one of he greatest movies ever made. Words cannot express how well the film combines all the elements a film needs, to be good. The acting is top notch, the cinematography is beautiful, the filming locations and sets are perfect, the sound is great, the music is excellent... I could talk about how great this movie is for hours. Francis Ford Coppola has a clear vision for this movie, and is expertly brought to life.The beginning of the film starts out at the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie. At the wedding reception we are introduced to the many of the members of the Corleone crime family, however not all of them are part of the ""family business"". At the wedding, Vito's youngest son, Michael, tells his then girlfriend, Kay, that he was not like his family. Throughout the rest of the film, we see Michael Corleone transform into the very thing he claims he hates. It's an excellent example of how character growth should be done.From the intriguing beginning where we find Vito Corleone being asked for favors, to the climatic ending where Michael finishes his transformation, The Godfather is a landmark film in American cinema."
4373,True,"The day before yesterday I decided that I should watch The Godfather since it's pretty much a movie that one would have to see during his lifetime, but I was very disappointed. I thought that it would be a great movie with a plot that would be interesting, characters that I could relate to and give me some form of entertainment during the course of the movie, but boy was I wrong.I was pretty much bored from the start to the end of the movie and the only reason why I kept watching was because I thought to myself ""This is a movie everyone must have seen during their lifetime"". It even took me two days to watch it because I was so bored that I paused the movie and went to bed and continued to watch it the day after and was still just as bored.The acting was okay at best and I felt that the actors could have done better but failed to do so, and the director failed to even get me interested in the characters. When some of the characters die I didn't care one bit, not once did I care. They could have killed everyone in the movie and I wouldn't care at all because I could not relate to anything of the characters persona.Due to the lack of character-interest I didn't get interested in the plot at all and it felt like I was dragged through the whole movie with a barbwire around my neck.Today I plan to get dragged once more when I'm going to watch The Godfather 2 and if it's anything like the first one it's going to be a horrible experience."
4374,True,"I read ""The Godfather"" novel, it was one of the best books that I have ever read. Not one minute in the story was I not entertained or interested. I was very excited to see how Frances Ford Coppola's collaboration with Mario Puzo, the author of the book, would translate this into a movie.When watching the movie I tried to put all of my memory of the book into the back of my head and try to enjoy the movie. But sadly the movie was just not entertaining as a movie by itself. Yes, the cast is one of the best ever assembled, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duval, etc.But all of the main events that should be entertaining, like the elimination of all the bosses in the end. Or the murder of Sunny Corleone at the toll both. But sadly they just bore you to the point were you want even Marlon Brando to die, which he later does. Even the performances from the actors themselves, especially Marlon Brando, leave much to be desired from these awesome actors.This is without a doubt the most overrated movie of all time. If you want to see the life of a mobster done right, see Scorcese's ""Casino"" and ""Goddfellas"". These do not only show the life of a mobster, but they are also entertaining with awesome acting from Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci every time.I give this movie 2/10, that's because Mario Puzo was involved."
4375,True,"The Godfather (1972) did for gangster movies what 2001: A Space Odyssey did for science fiction. Like Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola re-energized and, to a degree, reinvented a basic Hollywood pulp fiction action-entertainment genre, using it as a vehicle for the high artistic ambitions of a post-New Wave film ""auteur."" Within his narrower focus on 20th century American civilization (as opposed to Kubrick's philosophical speculations on human evolution), Coppola shapes the story of the Corleone Mafia family into an epic/satiric vision of American business, government, justice, and moral decline. The Godfather's brilliantly constructed opening sequence, the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter, not only establishes the Don's character, the nature of his organization, the role of family and Sicilian tradition in his world, and the character of his sons (three natural and one adopted), but also establishes the relationship between the Don's world and ""legitimate"" society. For instance, the film's opening words are those of Bonasera, a petitioner for a wedding ""favor,"" whose voice over a dark screen first asserts the American Dream, ""I believe in America. America has made my fortune,"" and then turns to disillusioned contradiction: ""for justice, we must go to Don Corleone.""Numerous subsequent lines of dialog establish literal or metaphorical connections between the criminal underworld and social institutions. Some of the most memorable ones include: ""My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator.""""Now we have the unions, we have the gambling; and they're the best things to have. But narcotics is a thing of the future. And if we don't get a piece of that action, we risk everything we have. I mean not now, but ten years from now."" ""It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business."" And most famously of all: ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" The film's title refers to two godfathers, the original Don Corleone and his youngest son - and ultimate successor - Michael. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Corleone, for which he was awarded a Best Actor Academy Award, balances the Don's subtly counter-pointed functions as beloved, grandfatherly patriarch and fearsome, brutal crime boss. Yet Michael, as the character most centrally and significantly affected by the film's plot and played with a brilliance equaling Brando's by a then unknown Al Pacino, is the principal protagonist.At the wedding, Michael's centrality is signaled by the Don's frantic call, ""Where's Michael? We are not taking the picture without Michael!"" A World War II hero still in decorated uniform, Michael is meanwhile busy differentiating himself from his family to his girl friend and future second wife, Kay (Diane Keaton). ""Luca Brasi held a gun to the band leader's head,"" he relates, ""and my father assured him that either his signature or his brains would be on the release. That's my family Kay. It's not me."" Michael's initial disinterest in Mafia activities is reinforced by his adoring father who envisions him as ""Senator Corleone"" or ""Governor Corleone"" not as his successor. That role is reserved for his hot-headed eldest son, Sonny (James Caan). But, of course, events conspire to suck Michael in - and to keep sucking him in right through Godfather III - the assassination attempt on his father, Michael's coolly murderous response, the car bomb meant for him that kills his first wife, the Sicilian beauty Apollonia (aptly named for the god of sun light), the riddled body of his brother Sonny. Inevitably, a morally darkened Michael emerges at the end of the film, one who outdoes his father in guile and ruthlessness and whose final brutal and deceitful acts in Godfather I seal his doom as a Macbeth-like villainous tragic hero.Shot mainly on location in various New York City locales, The Godfather spans a ten-year post World War II period. A multitude of props, costumes, and pop culture artifacts arranged by the film's art director, Warren Clyner, and production designer, Dean Tavoularis, lend a rich sense of historical authenticity to the film's mise en scene. Moreover, the film's lighting by brilliant cinematographer Gordon (""prince of darkness"") Willis, contributes greatly to both the film's realism and its thematic symbolism. Compare, for instance, the use of extremely dark, shadowy, color desaturated interior scenes ¬ñ especially in the Don's home office ¬ñ with the brightly lit, vivaciously colored outdoor wedding scene or the sun-drenched, romanticized Sicilian landscape.The Godfather is edited in the classic Hollywood invisible style, subordinating technique to the needs of narrative and visual continuity. But the film is expertly edited nonetheless. In particular one might note the stunning use of multiple parallel editing that occurs in one of the film's last scenes: the assassination of the other crime family heads, elaborately planned to coincide with Michael's participation in the baptism of sister Connie's child. Likewise, The Godfather's soundtrack is a memorable combination of diegetic period music (""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"") and a lush, operatic original score composed by one of the greatest film music composers, Nino Rota (a frequent Fellini collaborator as in 8 1/2).With The Godfather and its even more ambitious sequel, Coppola pushed the classic gangster film in the direction of high art and released it once and for all from the moralistic grip of the Hays Code, which arose in the 1930s in large part as a response to the romanticizing of criminals found in such early examples of the gangster genre as Scarface, Little Cesar, and Public Enemy. Not only did the code regulate the degree and nature of sexual and violent imagery in all films, but it also specifically required that criminals be portrayed as morally repulsive social deviants and that plots involving them be resolved with the implicit or explicit lesson that ""crime did not pay."" Fortunately for American popular culture The Godfather radically rewrote the rulebook and paved the way for a generation's-worth of gangster masterpieces ranging from the Scarface remake to Pulp Fiction to The Sopranos."
4376,True,"It's basically impossible to watch this movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola, without already knowing some of the major themes, motifs, plot twists, within author Mario Puzo's story; due to how popular the film is. Even, if you haven't saw the movie, you probably heard of it. If you had, saw it. You might agree with me, in scope, that this movie is indeed, one of the greatest films ever made. Based off, Mario Puzo's 1969 novel with the same name, The Godfather tells the story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) on his journey, from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss, during the criminal drug wars of the 1940/early 1950s. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found that a lot of critics, overpraise Marlon Brando's work in this, a way too much. Don't get me wrong, Marlon Brando does deserve, a lot of credit for making his character, the patriarch Vito Corleone, so iconic. I just don't believe, that he deserve, the Oscar for Best Actor, that year. In my opinion, Al Pacino should had be nominated & won. After all, Michael is pretty much, the main character, not Vito. Also, Pacino is the one actor that kept the movie, going, with his great range of emotional. Brando show-what disappears, toward the middle of the film. If any, Brando deserve to win, Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards, because Brando's acting is secondary to that of Pacino. It's not personality, it's only business. Besides that, the acting throughout the film was well-performed, from all the actors. I just wish, there wasn't much, many characters. It was so hard to keep track of each one. Some actors, worth noting for their performance are James Caan as Michael's hot-headed brother, Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Irish lawyer, Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Michael's girlfriend, Kay Adams & last, John Cazale as Michael's weaker brother, Fredo Corleone. As much, as I despise, certain gangster films. There was something, likable with these characters. Yes, they do, horrible stuff, but you can't help, feeling bad for them. Indeed, keep your friends close, your enemies closer. Not only was the film had gifted actors, but it was very well-shot. I love, how the film used doors, as a way to symbolize, the different between family life, and 'the family life'. A great example of this, was the last few minutes of the film in which Kay finds out, the truth nature about Michael. It's a crucial theme of the film. The five families are essentially living the American dream with specific ideals that America at the time greatly treasured. One could easily see this as a deconstruction or even an attack on the idea of the American Dream. So it was no surprise that the families met inside a Federal Reserve Bank. Talk about smart! I also like, how the movie has this stark bleak look to it. All the colors in the film, looks so muted, as if to say, this gangster film was indeed shot in early 1940s, technicolor. I like how, clever, the filmmaker was, when using bright colors. Most of the only bright color, used in the film, was orange. It was used as mostly an item, like a fruit symbol. It representing sin, and greed. It's as if it was the forbidden fruit, in the bible. It was also, used as a sexual way to show impending judgment. Everybody that got near it, end up, dying in the film. While, the movie has tons of other symbolism. It's also shroud in darkness and mystery. The movie even has a few film noir inspire scenes, where shadow, become a big factor to show, how shady, the underworld, can be. Vito's daughter's wedding scene shows the best of this. The movie has a lot of violence as well. Scenes like the real horse severed head were pretty gruesome. Still, compare to modern day, gangster movies, the sex, drugs and violence is pretty tame. For the most part, the movie kept to a somewhat classy mode with its subject matter. I do like the editing. The whole baptize sequence was amazing to watch. The pacing for the film is a mixed bag for me. There were some parts of the film that I kinda found boring or out of place, such as the Sicily, Las Vegas & Hollywood scenes. It felt like, I was watching two different films, due to how unfamiliar, each of those scenes, were, when comparing to the New York settling. I just glad, they were very short. The film also drops a lot of the novel's subplots, such as Sonny's mistress, having a large vagina, and having to get surgery on it. Another thing worth cutting is a lot of Johnny Fontane (Al Martino) and Lucy Mancini (Jeannie Linero) scenes. In the novel they both get big story lines nearly the equal of the main storyline with Michael. I'm glad, they cut it out, because it was too jarring. Though one major one, they cut out in this film: Don Vito's youth and rise to power came back, as part of the sequel, 1974's the Godfather: Part II. Happy, that they found, a way to add that, back in. Leave the Fontane BS. Take the cannoli, instead. The film score by Nino Rota was great. You really think of the word 'mafia' when you hear that tune. While, the film doesn't deliberately speak that word, it did expose, what was then, a mostly hidden underworld of Mafia organizations. Overall: While, some big time criminals and even some stars, like Frank Sinatra were against it, and boycott the film, but they couldn't stop the movie, from being made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 40 years after its release. It's a classic."
4377,True,"""The Godfather"" is about the Corleones - an organized crime family better known as the mob or mafia - that tells a great story of succession of the leadership of the crime family from an aging Don Vito Corleone to his reluctant and youngest son,Michael Corleone.This film directed by Francis Ford Coppola that was based on the novel of Mario Puzo stars legendary actor Marlon Brando and Al Pacino,an up-and-coming young actor back then who just happened to appear on his only second major film role.The cast also includes talented actors and actresses such as James Caan, Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton,John Cazale and Talia Shire.The story starts during the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter Connie.In it,we get meet the members of the Corleone family such Don Vito's oldest son Sonny and his adopted son as well as the consigliere Tom Hagen together with the different henchmen like Tessio and Clemenza as well as different people who are obtaining favors from Don Vito who is also known as the godfather.Then,we get to meet Michael and his girlfriend Kay.It was evident that Michael has no intentions of joining his father's business.But several events happen such as Don Vito getting shot,Sonny getting killed and the other rival members of the Five Families trying to overthrow the Corleones power and influence as Don Vito does not want to be part of the illegal drugs trade.Then,it became clear that the only son who should replace Don Vito,who is getting older and weaker as he approaching near his death,as the leader of the family is reluctant Michael.After Don Vito died,Michael made moves to retain the family's power and influence by killing the leaders of the rival families and getting rid of the traitors of among family.It ended with Michael succeeding and becoming the new godfather.This epic film definitely is the greatest film ever made.We have great performances coming from Marlon Brando,who won an Oscar as Don Vito,the upstart Al Pacino and the rest of the cast.We also have a great story involving the Corleones as we get to see the transition of the family's leadership from Don Vito to Michael.The characters of the story are definitely far from one-note and they can be as complex evoking humanity.We are also treated to great production set designs, memorable musical scores coming from Nino Rota, a superb script coming from Puzo and Coppola, and a magnificent direction coming from Coppola.With that said,it has become a benchmark for excellence in film and has for many years remained relevant despite being initially released 45 years ago when this review is written.Overall,it is simply a masterpiece."
4378,True,"I cannot think of a single negative of the Godfather. It truly is a classic and will always be one of the greatest films ever made. I have seen it many times and recently purchased the movie so that I could watch it anytime that I want. I love the score for this film and get goosebumps when I hear that opening trumpet begin to play. As the movie progresses I begin to feel a connection to the characters and become invested in their growth and story. As many times as I have seen this movie, I continue to have the same feelings. It is one of the movies that can never get old and will always be a masterpiece. It will be a number of years before anything can come close to the magnitude of this film and it may never be contested."
4379,True,"What a brilliant film. It is one of my favorites. The aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son. I love this film All of my family loves it My girlfriend loves it. I think it is one of the best films ever. It stars many actors such as Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. It is one of the most greatest films of all time. I have it on DVD at home and the Soundtrack at home.The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945¬ñ55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.Based on Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name, The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema and as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre. Ranked second to Citizen Kane by the American Film Institute in 2007,it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1990 as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".The film was the box office leader for 1972 and was, for a time, the highest-grossing picture ever made. It won three Academy Awards for that year: Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando) and in the category Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. Its nominations in seven other categories included Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. The success spawned two sequels: The Godfather Part II in 1974, and The Godfather Part III in 1990."
4380,True,"I have just seen it, for the first time. ¬£20 for the first 2 Godfather films and Fight Club on DVD, i figured that's got to be worth it for such acclaimed movies.Strong performances from Pacino, Caan and Duvall do lend realism to the plot, but i have to say i found Brando's mumbled dialogue really annoying (Authentic? - Maybe? Acclaimed?) but still annoying, and i was disappointed to find he still had a part to play in the film, even after the film maker's had him shot.The movie does have some fine moments (the horses head, Pacino's restaurant scene, Sonny's death) all good scenes, but when interlaced with tediously drawn out rubbish (The opening 20mins YAWN, Pacino's entire time spent in hiding, YAWN) I couldn't help but wish for the film to end.At nearly 3 hours long, the movie could have easily been trimmed by a hour and not lost anything, in summary this film has brilliance mixed with tedium and simply doesn't deserve its place in the number 1 spot.I hope part 2 is better, because part 1 has not inspired me to watch it, maybe when i have nothing else to do i will. Thank god Fight Club's a winner.6/10 Watch Goodfellas instead (It makes this film look timid)"
4381,True,"With a movie as critically acclaimed as The Godfather, you'd think it was the best movie of all time. Sadly, for me, this was not the case. It was a decent movie, of course; but, in the end, it had a few major flaws.First and foremost is a flaw that many may see as a great asset (thus pointing out the obviously subjective nature of movie watching): its length. Now, I have nothing against long movies, but this one just seemed to drag on and on and on. I've seen many people who made this complaint get called people with low attention spans and low intelligence; this is complete idiocy. The movie had, for all its apparent greatness, many superfluous scenes (the parts of the movie that took place in Sicily seemed particularly long and drawn out). It truly did not know when to end, and thus did not keep my interest.Another flaw was the the pompousness of the film. It truly seemed to me that every person involved was completely full of themselves and the movie they were making. It just bugged the crud out of me.Another flaw was the underdevelopment of many of the other crime bosses in the film, all of which are of course killed by Michael's men. I didn't even know any of their names, and this alone should show you how little I could care about them. A great movie makes you care about even the villains, so that their deaths are affecting.There's more I could say, but I have limited space here, so I'll just sum it up by saying that it was decent, but far from the greatest movie ever made. In fact, it is probably the most highly overrated movie of all time."
4382,True,"Lately it seems, ""The Godfather"" has had a ubiquitous presence on the cable channels; not a week goes by where I don't see it listed playing at one time or another. For some reason I've never considered watching the film from start to finish since the first time I saw it during it's theatrical release back in 1972 - until today. There's a good reason why. I don't think there's ever been another movie to stay with me the way this one has over the past four decades. I remember virtually everything about it, even the minor scenes like the hit on driver Paulie and the 'sleeps with the fishes' calling card regarding Luca Brasi. Also the names - Clemenza, Barzini, Solozzo, Tartaglia; Moe Green too, even though he wasn't Italian. So effective was the magic of the film that I still have to check every now and then to see if Abe Vigoda (Tessio) is still alive (like I did today), only to find out that yes he is, still going strong at nearly ninety! Quite simply, ""The Godfather"" is, with no pun intended, the godfather of all the great gangster films, dating all the way back to 1931's ""Little Caesar"" and ""Public Enemy"". For Marlon Brando, it was the quintessential performance of American cinema, so nuanced and mesmerizing that it's impossible to forget. The movie in fact was so powerful that it literally made overnight stars of it's supporting players - Pacino, Caan and Duvall.There has been enough written about the film that I don't need to get into the story itself. I'll content myself with mentioning the scenes that literally blow me away, then and now - Sonny's job on Carlo in the middle of the neighborhood (that last kick is priceless), the mob hit on Sonny in the causeway, Michael's restaurant rubout of Solozzo and McCluskey, and the way Michael handled Tom Hagen's ouster as consigliere. The cherry topping of course is the baptismal scene, Michael renouncing Satan as he does the devil's work of eliminating the heads of the families who stood in opposition to the Corleones. Every scene of the movie is staged perfectly, yet rendered effortlessly as if it were just another day in the life.It would have been too easy to use the classic tag line in my summary above, you know, the one about making an offer that can't be refused. With ""The Godfather"", it seems that every scene is larger than life, with the total picture being even greater than the sum of it's parts. So I'll content myself with a recommendation that seems apropos by quoting Clemenza after his man whacked Paulie - ""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli"". For cinema fans, ""The Godfather"" is all cannoli."
4383,True,"What happened to the sure-footed director of this film?  How did his impeccable craftsmanship ever give rise to such things as the slipshod, overwrought ""Dracula""?SPOILERS FOLLOWIt's hard to say, but there IS that moment near the end, which some mistake for a climax or even a turning point:  Michael is in church, at the Christening ceremony of his sister's child; his henchmen are in various positions around the city (one in Nevada), poised to murder the Corleone family's most powerful enemies and rivals.  Coppola introduces a device he had hitherto studiously avoided: fast cross cutting.  ""Do you, Michael Corleone, renounce Satan?"" asks a priest.  Cut to some act of violence.  Cut back to Michael: ""I do.""  Cut to violence.  ""And all his works?""  Cut: Blam! Michael: ""I do.""  Cut: another  stylishly staged shooting.  It's a wonder Francis Ford Coppola doesn't write the words ""Please note the irony"" across the screen.I don't fault the decision to use rapid, gliding montage at this point, given that it ISN'T a key moment, merely one that plays out decisions we had seen made earlier, but there's no denying that in the way it's done Coppola both hits us over the head and goes over the top (some of the killings are too operatic for what is essentially a stealth operation) - although thankfully, less far over the top than he probably planned, since the gravitational pull of his carefully made world remains strong.I must stress that this excess doesn't matter HERE.  I mention it because it's perhaps the seed of something that would grow and grow and ultimately choke later Coppola films.  Just a thought.  ""The Godfather"" itself is perfectly crafted and shaded.  There's the well realised and well photographed settings, both 1940s New York and timeless Sicily; there's the believability and depth (when The Don is shot and thought to be dead, the tears look unforced and REAL, which I doubt you could say of those in any other gangster film); there's the sense that we know these people, culturally homogenous yet not at all the same.  There's Nino Rota's wonderful score.  I don't think this is a GREAT film, in the sense that so many other people seem to think it is.  It doesn't matter.Interestingly, the morning of the day I saw ""The Godfather"" (I'd seen it before, but this was the first actual screening), someone wrote to me to protest that my harsh comments on Marlon Brando based on his performance in another film (""Viva Zapata!"") were unfair.  What I'd said had struck me as obvious: that Brando's introspective style reveals his character far more to him than it does to us; that he acts without INTERacting, failing to mesh with the rest of the cast; that he mumbles too much.  In my reply I had to admit that I hadn't seen many Brando performances, and of the earlier ones, only Zapata.  I was almost going to admit that his performance in ""The Godfather"" was faultless.  A good thing I didn't!  When I saw it again I realised that Brando may have sufficient grip on his character not to let the film down, but just barely; again, he introspects too much, interacts too little, and mumbles.Yet the acting in ""The Godfather"" and the film overall are too strong for this to matter in the least."
4384,True,"Regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. ""The Godfather"" is a beloved classic about organised crime, and the Sicilian lifestyles in America. Of course the movie is about the building of a dynasty, a business built on death, murder and betrayal that goes on to run itself on favours and illegal pleasures. However, in this story we see the life of Don Vito Corleone (Played to a tee by the magnificent Marlon Brando), giving favours on his daughter's Wedding day. Here we see a loving, caring man who is both equally loved and feared. So far in the movie, it has had fair tension and introduced us to the family. Then all of a sudden a film-maker awakens to find his prized race horse's head under his bed sheets, and suddenly the tensions of this movie rises considerably.Without really explaining anything else (I mean I really shouldn't have to), our focus is on the youngest Corleone son Michael (Stunning work from Al Pacino). As a man of considerable morals and high grounds, how far will he be willing to go when push comes to shove? Lets just say ""Falls from grace"" is a perfect statement, befitting of this rich ""Sepia"" toned movie.Something of a Masterpiece when the film came out back in 1972. ""The Godfather"", has only gotten better of age. There are so many iconic quotes and moments in the movie, and the cast is just seriously one of the best ever put to film. James Caan I hardly recognised, and Robert Duvall was just as brilliant as always. But obviously the biggest argument is, was this movie Brando's or Pachino's? Personally, I thought Brando was just incredible as always, and totally deserved the Oscar he turned down. Both nevertheless are unforgettable on screen.The pacing was impeccable, as well as the locations that are all shot beautifully. Some part of me does feel that the film is a bit too long, however a lot does happen and instantly captivates you enough to check out the sequels. The music was fantastic, helping bring the era and authenticity out of the picture and into the deepest parts of my brain. I could listen to the ""Love theme"" all day. As said earlier, the movie is about the dynasty of the family, the business of the family and the vengeance of the family. So many themes are present and so much more are explored. Every gangster film ever made owes something to Francis Ford Coppola's efforts.Final Verdict: Probably the first modern gangster epic ever made. As director Stanley Kubrick said: ""Probably the finest cast ever assembled"". 10/10."
4385,True,"You can't really criticize a film like ""The Godfather"", especially from a younger-type guy like me. Since its release in 1972, ""The Godfather"" has been highly praised by fans universally. It's extremely hard for a person who has never seen ""The Godfather"" without having high expectations because millions of people, maybe more have been talking about how wonderful it is. But as a film critic who has seen the movie several times and has read the novel that it was based on by Mario Puzo, this movie really deserves the credibility it gets. It really is that special. The film is a gripping epic that indulges the viewer with plenty of unsuspecting twists and a plot that works in a multitude of dimensions. The mobster's depicted here face many trials and tribulation that involve marriage, favours, family struggles, turncoats, tragic events, violence and rigor mortis.Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head patriarch and kingpin of his esteemed enterprise is acquainted to at his daughter's wedding, which is a special occurrence in Italian tradition (Sicilian in particular) where the father of the bride is to refrain from offering the groom any special favours. His representatives showing their signs of respect towards the Don are featured in the opening scenes are told through their ways of personal address and greeting regimentations. The Don is to be treated with respect and dignity, a man who follows his own frame of mind to what is fair, and will likely deny any means of avenge. As an example, if anyone was to fondle with his daughter in any kind of way grounds for murder. It's not revenge, as long as your daughter's still breathing.There are also numerous facets that indicate how not so respected the Don really is. Vito comes from the old school of Mafia, and can be labeled as a ""Moustache"" Pete. For one, unlike his adversaries, he refuses to get involved with drugs or smuggling for that matter. It this is much to the chagrin of other rival mob units in the state of New York. The violence is described disturbingly as nothing personal, it's just business. The philosophy behind this organized crime is chilling, but quite convincing. The violence is creepily accepted and sometimes happens all of the sudden. Suddenly, the Corleone enterprise falls on its foundations, and it's up to the next generation to restore the family so it could be ranked as the top of the best mob families.The cast features a myriad of talented performers each playing their respective roles flawlessly. The top stars like Brando as Vito, James Caan as the hot-tempered Sonny, Al Pacino as the likable Michael, John Cazale as middle-sibling Fredo, Robert Duvall as mob attorney Tom Hagen, Richard Castellano as Clemenza, Abe Vigoda as Tessio and Diane Keaton as Kay Adams are what I may have expected what the characters from Puzo's book look like physically. Even the smaller roles deserve special credit. The performances were absolutely amazing. The characters in the film compliment the characters from the novel and it is mainly due to the physical structuring and the carefully planned interpretation.The novel this movie was based on by Mario Puzo deserves praise in itself. Even though this movie was a fictional, there are a lot of authentic features that make every scene and every chapter to be real. I guess people when they think of mob bosses they visualize a supreme Don, sitting in his chair with a long facial expression contemplating with endless level-headedness and leadership. ""The Godfather"" is a marvel from both the film and the novel and it is hard to determine what medium is the better of the two.If there is one thing that the book is better would be character development. Al Pacino's Michael Corleone is a more prominent character in the novel than in the movie. Michael's transformation in the movie is at times a bit rushed, while in the book it's handled more gradual. The other character Luca Brasi played by Lenny Montana was a more vital character in the novel, which while he was an ally to the Corleone clan, is marked as a threatening adversary with a dark and dreary secret. In the movie comes across as a big oaf, and not as scary. It's also nice that some of the smaller characters from the novel have engaging back stories like Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden). But that's good for the novel's sake, while the film would result in overdone detailing.Overall, ""The Godfather"" is one of the greatest films ever made. Thanks mainly to the crew for creating a well-structured setting that compliments nicely to the characters, the script and most importantly, the direction of Francis Ford Coppola. Hats off to the cinematography from Gordon Willis which is backed nicely by the elegant score from Nino Rota and Carlo Savina. This film truly defines the words ""required viewings."""
4386,True,"What's to say about this movie that hasn't been said already. Pure cinema magic. The casting is superb, the character development is superb, the acting is first class, coupled with the legendary soundtrack a true masterpiece.From the script to the whole dialogue and interactions between the characters the attention to detail is stunning and I wish more modern movie makers would take the time to build and develop the characters like this movie does.From the opening scene, when Bonasera is looking for revenge for the beating of his daughter, to the closing scene when Kay sees Michael crowned as the Don and Neri closes the door, the movie just flows seamlessly from act to act. Coupled with the legendary soundtrackThe scene where Sonny, Michael, Tessio, Hagen and Clemenza are discussing hitting Solozzo is pure gold. As they all sit around nonchalantly discussing murder, before Michael pipes up and tells them how if they arrange a meeting he will kill them both is so just so well acted, that you actually believe these guys are gangsters.A real example of great story telling transferred to film."
4387,True,"The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow Min out of paper cartons.""The Godfather"" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.But Brando's performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whisper, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although ""The Godfather"" is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn't time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he'll have to cancel his day at the races).The success of ""The Godfather"" as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garroting."
4388,True,"The first Godfather movie may be over 43 years old but still holds up well after all of these years. The film is at heart a story of family. It is the story of Vito Corleone and his three sons, Santino (Sonny), Frederico (Fredo), and Michael. It is also the story of Vito's other family, the mafia. The story focuses on Michael, the youngest son. At first, he wants nothing to do with the family business but as the film progresses, he is drawn more and more into it and by the end, he is running the family - both families. The transformation of Michael from family outcast to Godfather is fascinating to see. Al Pacino does a wonderful job of transforming from playful young man to fearsome gangster. Without going into too much detail so as not to ruin the movie for those few who have never seen it, several scenes stand out: The horses head is probably the most famous, or infamous, and has been used in homage and parody by many others in the years since the movie was released. When I rank the best movies I have seen, the original Godfather is always number one on my list."
4389,True,"I love this movie. It's the greatest movie I ever seen in my life. Every time I watch it I see something new. It has drama, action and even comedy. The story is great. It centers around the most powerful New York mafia run by The Godfather. It teaches you about family and betrayal, about life in general. All that Michael does is for his family. He even sacrifices his relationship with his girlfriend to protect his family. The movie is amazingly shot, giving it amazing light. The characters are bigger than life and played by some of the greatest actors to ever live. The soundtrack is very good. All in all is must see."
4390,True,"Taking a best-selling novel of more drive than genius (Mario Puzo's The Godfather), about a subject of something less than common experience (the Mafia), involving an isolated portion of one very particular ethnic group (first-generation and second-generation Italian-Americans), Francis Ford Coppola has made one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment.The Godfather, which opened at five theaters here yesterday, is a superb Hollywood movie that was photographed mostly in New York (with locations in Las Vegas, Sicily, and Hollywood). It's the gangster melodrama come of age, truly sorrowful and truly exciting, without the false piety of the films that flourished forty years ago, scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesn't (or, at least, shouldn't) pay.It still doesn't, but the punishments suffered by the members of the Corleone Family aren't limited to sudden ambushes on street corners or to the more elaborately choreographed assassinations on thruways. They also include lifelong sentences of ostracism in terrible, bourgeois confinement, of money and power, but of not much more glory than can be obtained by the ability to purchase expensive bedroom suites, the kind that include everything from the rug on the floor to the pictures on the wall with, perhaps, a horrible satin bedspread thrown in.Yet The Godfather is not quite that simple. It was Mr. Puzo's point, which has been made somehow more ambiguous and more interesting in the film, that the experience of the Corleone Family, as particular as it is, may be the mid-twentieth-century equivalent of the oil and lumber and railroad barons of nineteenth-century America. In the course of the ten years of intra-Mafia gang wars (1945-1955) dramatized by the film, the Corleones are, in fact, inching toward social and financial respectability.For the Corleones, the land of opportunity is America the Ugly, in which almost everyone who is not Sicilian or, more narrowly, not a Corleone, is a potential enemy. Mr. Coppola captures this feeling of remoteness through the physical look of place and period, and through the narrative's point of view. The Godfather seems to take place entirely inside a huge, smoky, plastic dome, through which the Corleones see our real world only dimly.Thus, at the crucial meeting of Mafia families, when the decision is made to take over the hard drug market, one old don argues in favor, saying he would keep the trade confined to blacks¬ó""they are animals anyway.""This is all the more terrifying because, within their isolation, there is such a sense of love and honor, no matter how bizarre.The film is affecting for many reasons, including the return of Marlon Brando, who has been away only in spirit, as Don Vito Corleone, the magnificent, shrewd old Corleone patriarch. It's not a large role, but he is the key to the film, and to the contributions of all of the other performers, so many actors that it is impossible to give everyone his due.Some, however, must be cited, especially Al Pacino, as the college- educated son who takes over the family business and becomes, in the process, an actor worthy to have Brando as his father; as well as James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, Al Martino, and Morgana King. Mr. Coppola has not denied the characters' Italian heritage (as can be gathered by a quick reading of the cast), and by emphasizing it, he has made a movie that transcends its immediate milieu and genre.The Godfather plays havoc with the emotions as the sweet things of life¬ómarriages, baptisms, family feasts¬óbecome an inextricable part of the background for explicitly depicted murders by shotgun, garrote, machine gun, and booby-trapped automobile. The film is about an empire run from a dark, suburban Tudor palace where people, in siege, eat out of cardboard containers while babies cry and get underfoot. It is also more than a little disturbing to realize that characters, who are so moving one minute, are likely, in the next scene, to be blowing out the brains of a competitor over a white tablecloth. It's nothing personal, just their way of doing business as usual."
4391,True,"Since I was a small boy, whenever I heard of others talking of the greatest movies ever made, The Godfather always came up,most of the time, at the top. I always thought that the movie was overrated, that is, until watched it two years ago.How to tell if a movie is good? If you can't stop thinking about it, if you keep replaying the characters' lines in your sleep, then the movie isn't just good, it's great. The Godfather's impact on the movie industry is incalculable, in almost ever modern gangster movie there is at least one reference to it.I can find no flaw in this movie. If there were anything such as a 'perfect' movie, this is it. Coppola provides excellent direction such that though the movie stretches to almost three hours, you won't be bored for one minute. The highlight of this film is an innovation. The gangsters here are not portrayed as mindless monsters but as men with families. We see Vito and Michael Corleone as protagonists rather than antagonists. Credit for this goes to Mario Puzo's original source material but let us not forget the actors.Marlon Brando gives the greatest performance of not only his career but of any other actor as the family patriarch. He's so Don-like that you just wished you could go to him with all your problems too. Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone. But he doesn't give a single performance, he gives two. At the beginning, he plays a war hero who doesn't want anything to do with the family business. Pacino skillfully shows us Michael's transition from this to a cold blooded Don at the end. The other actors play their parts well too. In fact, there has never been any other better cast than the cast of The Godfather.A cinematic masterpiece, this is one for the ages."
4392,True,"""The Godfather"" has been a title so beloved and entirely embraced as a significant, cultural phenomenon, that in a certain level demands of you to watch it with full recommendations off of it. Especially if you're young, there is absolutely no way that the buzz of the ""greatest movie in history"" did not get you. So, even though that buzz doesn't necessarily ruin the viewing for you all-together, I will accept that while I was watching, I was unintentionally trying to like it and feel it.The beginning of the film sets the mood perfectly. There are no attachments to settled humor or dry dialogue. It warns us that this is going to be a serious take, on some pretty serious issues. Don Corleone's first lines are self-aware and carefully put. This dominating appearance shows us a man trusted, beloved and respected and at the same time feared, depressed and deserted. And that goes for both his family and outsiders. He is a mafia man, one of the greatest, and his life is surrounded by his business partners, by his associates and comrades in this dark lifestyle. And throughout the entire movie, he is presented to have balanced the time between family and business, yet that seems like one impossible task. Micheal Corleone, son of the Godfather, is introduced like a man with a very different approach and very different opinions on the case of life and choices than the rest of his family and especially his father. That happens for two reasons: early on his life he decided not to be like him (even though he seems to be the one attached by the Godfather as the favorite) and he has chosen a decent life for him and Kay, the love of his life. Then, everything goes down the drain: someone attempts to kill the Godfather. It is at that point when the son Micheal starts his decay... No promises, no commitments, no wrongs... Someone tried to kill his loving father. He stares at every single person in his family just standing by, so in his rage, decides to do the unthinkable. Using his status as the most innocent of the Corleone family, he exacts revenge.When he succeeds, he exiles himself out of the country until things can settle down. He attempts to start a new life away from the madness with Apollonia, a beautiful woman he meets and falls in love with (although never convincing even himself that he has forgotten Kay). He comes to know the hard way that he can't run away from what he has done and what his family stands for. Someone tries to kill him even so far from his home but gets to Apollonia. So upon his return, he accepts the position of the new ""Godfather"" and immediately seems to be a changed man.Micheal retrieves Kay, makes unconditional promises and ends up being the very person he was trying to avoid.There are several things in this film that make it astounding. Relationships within the family are displayed in such a truthful way. Francis Ford Coppola offers us a chance to connect with many different characters and their several views. The main plot is driven excellently, with Don Corleone and Micheal taking the grandeur, but in the meanwhile we get to know the deep motions and powers of every person slightly connected to this world. What we get is a fiery and passionate film exploring deep meanings and strong notions. Marlon Brando won the Academy Award for what was an unbelievably great performance. After this film, I totally get his worldwide fame as one of the greatest actors of all time. Al Pacino shines with charisma (which he perfected on the second part) in the greatest role of his career. And besides these two super-actors, is there anyone from the cast that I can talk badly for? All great.I guess the only issue with this movie is it's running-time and most importantly the somewhat complicated way things glue together. I understand that Mario Puzo had a difficult task of bringing the book on- screen, but it's the way we are drawn to these characters that makes me confused about who is who. And that is the reason I suggest we stick to the father-son relationship and not worry about certain aspects and scenes we don't understand or just keep asking ""who is that guy talking""?This is the ""Godfather"" that everyone is talking about for decades, and if you don't like what you hear in the very first scene in that dark room, I warn you... turn of the picture and don't watch anymore. Come back a few years later when you could probably handle it.On the other hand, you must ask yourself: can you feel the zest for respect and loyalty when Don Corleone whispers his lines? Don't you yearn for the moral and innocent Micheal as the movie goes? Can you sympathize with Kay when the door closes at the end? Then ""The Godfather"" got you where it should have."
4393,True,"This type of movies which you get to watch over and over again without getting bored of it, they way it has been scripted, acted, produced and directed is really attractive and amazingly catching your breath, it has a lot of life lessons to learn from no matter what do you do in your life, it also shows the importance of family bonding and keeping it all balanced. I'm convinced that I will never ever get to watch a similar movie to this one with this brilliance in every aspect, I don't even believe that if there would be anyone on this earth who has never saw the Godfather Trilogy, it is absolutely highly recommended, but of course its not suitable for the little kids, it has lots of violent scenes, hopefully we'll get to see more and more of these awesome titles."

4395,True,"When people think of ""The Godfather"", they usually think of the Mafia. But, as Entertainment Weekly noted, calling ""The Godfather"" a Mafia movie is like calling ""The Odyssey"" a guide to the Aegean Sea. This story of how the Corleone family rules New York with their own version of justice entails everything that makes movies good.First, the opening scene. The shot of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) sitting in his chair petting his cat sets the Don up as a fatherly - but shady - figure. Then, you see Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding: the Corleones are not just a bunch of evil slime-balls. During the wedding, Michael (Al Pacino) arrives. Wearing his military uniform, Michael looks like a handsome young man - possibly an allusion to how these people are adept at deceiving other people. At the wedding, Michael meets WASP-ish outsider Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), who's naturally a little weirded out by the whole Mafia lifestyle - at one point, Michael has to tell her: ""That's my family, Kay. That's not me."" The other two sons are Sonny (James Caan), the immature playboy, and Fredo (John Cazale), the loser. And there's also the adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), now a lawyer. After a trip to Hollywood where he unsuccessfully tries to get a producer to hire singer Johnny Fontane (who apparently was not really based on Frank Sinatra), we all know what Tom does with the horse.A scene that did a really good job showing the break between 1st and 2nd generation Americans is the scene where Michael and Kay are Christmas shopping and ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" is playing. Vito, as an immigrant, kept many of the traditions from his native country. Michael, born and raised in the US, certainly seems less Italian that his father.Then, of course, Vito gets shot. After Michael gets revenge, he has to hide out in Sicily. While he's there...well, we all know what happens to Sonny. This prompts Vito to negotiate with the other families. But then, Michael turns out to be even more ruthless than his father.Probably the most incredible scene is when Michael presides over the baptism of Connie's child. As soon as Michael ""renounces"" Satan, things get ugly. It basically says that every time that they say something holy, someone gets slaughtered.All in all, Francis Ford Coppola created an inimitable cinematic masterpiece. And the sequel actually managed to equal the original."
4396,True,"I'm not a fan of this type of movies, but since I like Al Pacino and I've heard so much about this so-called ""legendary"" Godfather, I decided to give it a try. I must say this is the most inexplicably overrated piece of trash I've ever seen. The characters are all ridiculous, unsympathetic and under developed, the story drags and lacks any real conflict and dynamics¬Ö But the most disgusting aspect is the movie's intent to glorify a bunch of low-life criminals and turn them into larger-than-life figures, into some kind of royalty. This whole ""family"" tradition is just ludicrous. We're supposed to ""care"" about these characters, to think that they are ""cool"". The major problem here is that there's no real conflict. There's no redeeming value whatsoever, they're all despicable and one-dimensional, so why the hell would I care. The violence (which is particularly sickening) is another issue, but I guess audiences have come to appreciate it, and it's now a ""hallmark"" of the genre. Imagine, the Godfather's pregnant daughter gets beaten with a belt. But guess what: she's not likable either! She's hysterical, obnoxious and, even worse, she keeps defending her abusive husband. In another scene, James Caan beats the hell out of someone in front of children. Marvelous! That's just great, not to mention cool and ""culturally relevant"". Marlon Brando speaking with a husky voice and cotton in his mouth is incredibly ridiculous. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone suddenly turns, from a principled man who doesn't want to have anything to do with murder, into a ruthless criminal. What? This character has no depth, no consistency whatsoever. His relationships with women are so poorly portrayed, they add nothing to his development. It's Pacino's worst, I can't imagine why anyone would think this is a great performance. If you want to see a good gangster movie, go watch ""Donnie Brasco"" instead."
4397,True,"So, those of you who haven't seen it may wonder, ""What's so good about the Godfather? Why is it that this, out of every movie ever made, is considered by so many people to be one of the if not the all-time best?"" Allow me to explain as best I can. It's the kind of movie where everything is perfect. Everything. The acting, the script, the pacing, the cinematography, right down to the soundtrack. All of it.Oh, sure, it's a leisurely movie. It clocks in at just under three hours, and the plot takes a while to unfold. But it is NOT ""slow"" or ""boring."" While not a suspense film in the traditional sense, the movie is definitely suspenseful, and I have to applaud Coppola for his excellent use of tension building. In other words, he uses the three-hour length of the film perfectly: there's not a wasted minute among these 175, not a single bit I'd take out.And besides, the acting is great. Just awesome. Brando's performance is stunning; the guy just oozes cool, as he always does. He's magnetic as Vito Corleone, arguably his most famous role ever. And, of course, Al Pacino's Michael Corleone deserves nothing but the highest of praise. It was the guy's big break, and he does a fantastic job displaying Michael's ruthless, cunning, coldly intelligent rise to power. The two of them pretty much make the movie, but even people playing bit parts give their all, resulting in a movie that makes mobsters seem very human. Special shout-out to Robert Duvall for his excellent turn as Tom ""Badass"" Hagen, and Diane Keaton (one of my favorite actresses, I'll add) as Michael's girlfriend and moral compass Kay. Having been mostly familiar with her for her roles in those classic Woody Allen movies, I had no idea she could carry a dramatic role, but she does an excellent job. And the script is just awesome, including a couple classic lines.Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes."" And, of course, ""He made him an offer he couldn't refuse."" A whole ton of memorable ones. Actually, pretty much every line in this movie is quotable, and given its three-hour length, that's pretty impressive. And that theme song... oh man. One of the best ever written.A note also must be made on the baptism scene. All aspiring filmmakers should watch this movie for a lot of reasons, but for that scene in particular. The building of tension, the symbolism, the sacred-profane juxtaposition, the heart-stopping climax... perfect. The scene encapsulates everything I love about the movie into just a few minutes.And that's the Godfather for you. It's bleak, tender, touching, violent, thoughtful, occasionally horrifying (the famed horse head scene, anyone?), and sometimes even darkly funny. It's a complete masterpiece in every sense of the word. This, and its sequel for that matter, is a movie for the ages. Basically, if it's directed by Francis Ford Coppola and it's got Robert Duvall in it, you're in for a fantastic movie. That's a good rule of thumb. And the book it's based on is just as good!"
4398,True,"The Godfather series stands as the best in the mob dramas, butthat doesn't mean it is as spectacular as advertised.  In generalmob dramas have been overrated from Godfather to the SopranosTV series.  The main problem with The Godfather is that many plotelements are not shown or even described.  The followingexample is a *spoiler* so if you don't wish to hear a fairly majorplot point don't read on.  In the middle portion of the film Sonnypicks up the phone and then goes racing off in the car with othersscrambling to follow.  He then is gunned down.  Neither the topicof the call nor the reason he was killed are told to the audience,leaving them wondering why it happens aside from the usualtension throughout the movie.  These types of skimpy explanations make too many parts unbelievable that the plot is aweakened form of a potentially great plot.  Outside of that themovie features fine acting and scenery for a decent butdisappointing experience."
4399,True,"Given the rave reviews, I was very excited when I finally had time to sit down and watch this movie start to finish. I ended up more than a little disappointed. My biggest complaint is that the movie glorifies the underworld in a way that ends up seeming very corny--one scene features a bunch of civilized looking crime lords sitting around a table talking about how gambling, alcohol, and prostitution are OK, but drugs cross the line.Sure, the story incorporates a lot of dramatic effects, but in the end I felt like the drama was forced into the setting in a cheap attempt to make mid-20th century organized crime look serious and exciting. In this way, The Godfather is a little bit like rap music--it validates a fast-paced, unlawful lifestyle by glorifying the coming of power and masculinity that its main characters undergo."
4400,True,"First I would like to state that I am 20 years old this movie was made 16 years after I was born, but it is my favorite movie of all time. I really get annoyed when I hear this nonsense about young people can't judge movies because they haven't seen all the classics, well I have seen them all , Casablanca, Citizen Kane, On the Waterfront, North by Northwest and so on. I own all three of these movies, and the original is the best, 2 is very close to the original and 3 is decent. I also hate these people who judge this movie poorly because its all about Italians its pathetic I read so many comments here and everywhere that the sole basis of a poor rating is it being about Italians its a joke, Like in on the waterfront when Marlon Brando's character, transitions from a goon for organized crime to at the end of the film a changed man who wants to be a better man, Michael Corleone's character I feel is the greatest transformation in all of film history, he changes from this nice quiet military, war hero, good citizen, to a dark, ruthless, emotionless character, which he really has to do the collapse of his family. That alone i think makes this movie great, not to forget how great Marlon Brando is in this along with James Caan and Robert Duvall. This movie broke a lot of barriers in film, starting a lot of trends and setting standards for so many other mafia movies, like Goodfellas, and the Departed etc... I really think that if you have never seen it you should invest some time because you will not be disappointed."
4401,True,"I am studying Shakespeare's Othello in my Literature class, and i cant believe how much of The Godfather (trilogy) relates to the play.There is xenophobia-Both Othello and Michael are military leaders who are somewhat distanced from their society (the trials in part 2) The idea of Othello and Michael both wanting redemption at the end of their lives by God (Othello kills himself, whereas Michael crushes his internal personality) Women become the object of the men around them, but lead them to their deaths- Sonny trying to save his sister from her husband, & Othello being destroyed by Iago's manipulations about Desdemona's infidelity The patriarchal society, where both Desdemona and Kay are excluded from society The over trusting nature of Othello vs the suspicious nature of Michael The theme of family and the destruction of family internally There are a few other similarities, but i cant think of them at the moment So i simply present this idea as something to look into.Hope this provides some food for thought :)"
4402,True,"The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. Films like The Godfather are the reason i have a passion and love for film. In few movies can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one.If The Godfather was only about gun Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. Every major character,and more than a few minor ones is molded into a distinct, complex individual.The film Begins in the study of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Godfather, who is holding court. It is the wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request on that day. So the supplicants come, each wanting something different - revenge, a husband for their daughter, a part in a movie.The family has gathered for the event. Michael (Al Pacino), Don Vito's youngest son and a second world war hero, is back home in the company of a new girlfriend (Diane Keaton). The two older boys, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there as well, along with their ""adopted"" brother, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the don's right-hand man.With the end of the war, the times are changing, and as much as Don Vito seems in control at the wedding, his power is beginning to erode. By the standards of some, his views on the importance of family, loyalty, and respect are antiquated. Even his heir apparent, Sonny, disagrees with his refusal to get into the drug business. Gambling and alcohol are forces of the past and present; narcotics are the future. But Don Vito will not compromise, even when a powerful drug supplier named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) arrives with promises of high profits for those who back him.Don Vito's refusal to do business with Sollozzo strikes the first sparks of a war that will last for years and cost many lives. Each of the five major mob families in New York will be gouged by the bloodshed, and a new order will emerge. Betrayals will take place, and the Corleone family will be shaken to its roots by treachery from both within and without.The Corleone with the most screen time is Michael (it's therefore odd that Al Pacino received a Best Supporting Actor nomination), and his tale, because of its scope and breadth, is marginally dominant. His transformation from ""innocent"" bystander to central manipulator is the stuff of a Shakespearean tragedy. By the end, this man who claimed to be different from the rest of his family has become more ruthless than Don Vito ever was.Next to Humphrey Bogart's Rick from Casablanca, Oscar winner Marlon Brando's Don Vito may be the most imitated character in screen history. The line ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" has attained legendary status, as has the entire performance. With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando has created a personae that will be recalled for as long as motion pictures exist.Don Vito is a most complicated gangster. In his own words, he is not a killer, and he never mixes business with personal matters. He puts family first (""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man"") and despises displays of weakness. He understands the burden of power, and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the ""throne"", is one of The Godfather's most revealing moments (about both father and son).The Godfather had three Best Supporting Actor nominees, all well-deserved. The first was Pacino (who probably should have been nominated alongside Brando in the Best Actor category). The other two were James Caan and Robert Duvall. In a way, it's surprising that Duvall wasn't passed over. His presence in The Godfather isn't flashy or attention-arresting. Like his character of Tom Hagen, he is steady, reliable, and stays in the background. Not so for Caan's Sonny, whose demonstrative and volatile personality can't be overlooked.Family responsibility. A father's legacy. The need to earn respect. The corrupting influence of power. These are some of the ingredients combined in Francis Ford Coppola's cinematic blender. They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries.Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York's Italian crime families. The word ""Mafia"" conjures up images of the sinister and mysterious - scenes of the sort where Luca Brasi meets his fate. Francis Ford Coppola has tapped into this fascination and woven it as yet another element of the many that make his motion picture a compelling experience."
4403,True,"I finally watched this movie, and I just don't get the hype. I didn't dislike it, and the violence didn't bother me, but I found it over-long and very, very slow. I'm a 50-something who doesn't demand a break-neck pace in a film, even an ""action"" film¬Ö I'm used to watching long movies that take some time to unfold, and I don't mind that. I have patience. But ""The Godfather"" just seemed to be moving at the wrong pace for its subject matter. I never got into it. I finished it, but I didn't feel drawn into their world.Not helping was the fact that of course by now everyone, even those who haven't seen the film, knows about all the catch-phrases and classic scenes, so they seem like jokes (although naturally that wouldn't have been a problem when the film was newly-released). Brando almost seemed to be a caricature of himself in the early scenes¬Ö although he got a little better, a little less heavy-handed, after the Don came home from the hospital. In that first sequence in his office during the wedding, I could hardly understand a word he was saying. How could anyone take a man who spoke that way seriously? But again, I was watching it after many years of encountering deliberately bad Brando imitations, so I was at a disadvantage in that respect.That wedding¬Ö good lord, it lasted longer than many marriages do! I thought it was never going to be over. But while I was watching it, I recalled that I had in fact tried to watch this movie about 30 years ago, when my brother was really into it. I didn't even make it through the wedding. I remember my brother fast-forwarding the VHS tape to show me Abe Vigoda when he became convinced I wasn't going to sit and watch the whole thing with him¬Ö one quick look at Abe Vigoda and I was outta there. This time I also noticed one of my favorite character actors, Vito Scotti, in the wedding sequence.The people who did ""General Hospital"" in the 1990's must have loved this film. They even lifted the mobster's-chick-gets-blown-up-in-car idea for recycling on the soap opera.I watched the DVD over two nights. The local public library gives me 7, and for a while there I thought I was gonna need 'em all. A good illustration of my feelings for the tension and pacing of the film are that after Sonny bought it at the tollbooth, I turned it off for the night and went to bed, since that was as good a place as any to break. Just didn't care, one way or the other, what was going to happen next. One less character to keep track of. Plenty more where he came from. I was just hoping Vito Scotti would come back.I won't give it a 1 as others have in a deliberate attempt to bring down its average¬Ö I'll give it an honest rating that I really feel it deserves. The fact that I don't understand why so many people are so crazy about this film doesn't necessarily mean that I'm right and they're wrong¬Ö in fact, it might well be the opposite. But I stand by the title of this review: I just don't get it."
4404,True,"A family, the Don, everyone knows him, everyone knows of his power, here is the end of his era and simply the beginning of another, we a fantastic look into a family, into a style of life. It begins and we see who Vito Corleone is, we see another man who shares some things with Vito, both are Italians now established in America, that other man believes in the country that gave him and his family a fine life certainly, here you see what the Corleone family can do. And is a wonderful contrast, is the life the Corleone family, Vito ordered for justice and next he is dancing with his daughter. Family and the business, so in the business part we meet Sollozzo, big nose Italian, great businessman, narcotics are the future and Sollozzo knows that to get to that bright future Vito is important. And all is simply because of don't keeping you very own thoughts with you, every one knew that narcotics means dollars, Vito's son and right hand Tom Hagen, Vito's eldest son Santino but the decision was only of Vito. Then this is a terrific story, logic and business, ""nothing personal"", here Michael Corleone will enter, not to the film certainly but to the business. As any other character Michael is really interesting, here we know that he is a war hero, he is not like his family but certainly he knows the world of his family, he was born in that world. Basically during the very first part of the film we see Michael as a normal man with his former girlfriend Kay, buying Christmas presents, going to the cinema, having dinner and stuff. Soon we will see him in Sicily but before we see his first contact with the business part, obviously he suffered like Santino or Tom when he saw on the newspaper that Vito Corleone was shoot and that was still unknown if he was dead or alive so basically is this what puts Michael closer to the business part. So this is the very beginning of a new era but we don't know that yet, after all Michael was going to have a meet with Sollozzo and his dirty police officer because he was a civilian, not related with the family business. Is a great scene, the very best of Pacino in this film so Sollozo and his dirty police officer are dead, a new ""chapter"" in The Godfather begins, another engaging part of the film, for me each second of The Godfather is wonderful. So we for the first time see Sicily, there Michael is just waiting, there he meets a beautiful girl, she becomes his wife, certainly there are news from New York, Santino was killed (an emblematic scene), the future of Michael is only one. The last time we see Vito as the Don we see him together with Tattaglia, Barzini, Cuneo and Stracci, after this Vito realizes about something and that will save Michael's life. He is still the Don for the men of the Corleone family but certainly if they trust in Vito and are loyal to Vito they must trust in Michael and be loyal to Michael who at the time was already father, Anthony the name of his son, together with Anthony Vito is laughing, enjoying a normal time with his grandson, the most unexpected death thinking in Don Vito Corleone after the life he had, he always had honor, love for his family, he died in a peaceful way, playing with his grandson, in his house, if that would have been an offer certainly would have an offer he can't refuse. The cast is simply perfect, the voice of Brando, the strange charisma of James Caan as Santino, one of Pacino's best performances, simply each actor/actress is fantastic giving life to all those memorable characters. My very first experience with The Godfather was not a really long time ago, was in 2005 and I came to them together with some members of my family who like me had never seen by then any of the three films, I loved The Godfather and in 2006 I read the novel by Mario Puzo. I remember not having clear in my mind each detail of the film when I started reading the novel, by then I had seen only once The Godfather. I loved the novel and after reading it I went to another one by Puzo, The Last Don and I loved it also. So after this I remember having this sort of Mafia summer by watching first the miniseries based on The Last Don and later watching again The Godfather trilogy. This film has become the one I love the most, its long runtime feels like nothing, I watched it a lot of times back in 2006 once I had read the novel, fantastic. I received for Christmas the Coppola Restoration four-disc set on Blu-ray, while I haven't seen yet Part II and III (and the new bonus material) on Blu-ray this part looks so beautiful, in short you remember how it looks the blood of Moe Greene (during that memorable baptism sequence)? Well on Blu-ray it finally looks like blood!PD: my very first IMDb comment was precisely for The Godfather. While I'm not at all ashamed or anything like that about it I don't like it either so I decided to delete it and write another one. I was going to put it here just because it was my very first comment but thanks to the words limit I can't. I will put it on my message board profile."
4405,True,"Adapted from a Mario Puzo novel, The Godfather has had the most extreme change in views for me, until a couple of weeks I despised it but that was before I rewatched it and now I love it. I think my hate for it was based on when I first saw it at the age of about 16, I really wasn't mature to appreciate the sheer beauty of The Godfather. When released it became of the biggest grossing movies of the 70's and it's no hard to see why. There are so many great aspects of The Godfather. The characters are just so well etched out. The story centres around the Corleone family who are involved with the underworld and their fight to gain supremacy of the underworld over a couple of decades. There is Don Corleone, who maybe an underworld figure but is a man of principle. An example of that is in the scene where he refuses to start selling drugs. Then there is Sonny,who is a far more ruthless man than his father. Micheal, who is the good son is working towards a respectable career. Their worlds turn upside down when Don is almost killed by rival. Sonny takes over the family business and wants revenge. Micheal gets his hands dirty by gunning down the rival(in the famous restaurant scene). Micheal is forced to flee the country so that he can avoid going to jail. Sonny is then eventually killed by rivals and Micheal is forced to run the business. After a few murders Micheal becomes as much of a ruthless mobster as his deceased brother Sonny. What is so remarkable is how family life and business life are intertwined so beautifully. In the beginning at the wedding for instance when they decide to do favours for their guests. All the leads were extraordinary,my personal favourite being Marlon Brando as Don Corleone. There are very few movies that can still shock audiences thirty years after they were first released, The Godfather is one of those rare movies. The scene in which a producer finds his beloved horse in bed with him was deeply disturbing. The Godfather I believe stands heads and shoulders above any Gangster movies because The Godfather is not just about the Mafia, it's also about family. I think most of the credit for the Godfather should go to Francis Ford Coppola. I regard The Godfather to be one of the most remarkable and iconic movies ever made and all the people involved with it should be applauded. Highly recommended to lovers of classic cinema."
4406,True,"It could be said that the film-adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel marked the beginning of a new era, as it established talents hitherto unknown to the wider public, including Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and director Francis Ford Coppola. Furthermore, THE GODFATHER is often thought of as a ""comeback"" to Marlon Brando, which apparently puzzled the actor himself, as he pointed out in his autobiography that he'd been doing movies without considerable intermission for the last twenty-or-so years. However, the claim may not have been so unreasonable after all, as the role of Vito Corleone made Brando truly sought-after again. By the time Brando embarked on the role, no major studios would hire him due to a reputation for being ""impossible"" to work with, and Coppola was only able to convince Paramount that the actor was simply tailor-made for the part and could not be neglected by having him do a screen-test first. Considering that Brando had once revolutionized acting in America through his raw, unmasked portrayals of Stanley Kowalski and Terry Malloy in the 1950's, this procedure may sound shocking, but once accomplished, Brando proved that he remained the king of acting in the end. His portrayal of Corleone may strike us as being somewhat of a caricature today, as it has been endlessly imitated (and parodied) since, but Brando did in fact attribute the character with far more attention to complex detail than seen in a typical movie ""gangster-boss"" up till that time. That Brando's performance has now, in the eyes of younger generations such as my own, turned somewhat into a clich√© is simply the inevitable result of his initial originality.Also Pacino, Keaton, James Caan and Robert Duvall are, of course, quite outstanding in their roles. Particularly in Pacino's case, his handling of his character Michael Corleone's dramatic development as a person which is so crucial to the story, comes off as completely convincing. From being apparently a rather sympathetic character at the beginning, he changes as he becomes increasingly involved in his father's business life. It is this devoted focus on character development, as well as on how conflicting aspects of a personality interchange such as in Vito Corleone's case, that truly make the story so intriguing as it is. However, it is one thing to have a story of nearly endless potential, but this does not necessarily result in a successful cinematic interpretation of it. Other than outstanding performances, the direction of Francis Ford Coppolla is, of course, more than merely significant; even if one neglects the other qualities of the film, it may be treasured for its own sake, due to Coppolla's extremely competent, innovative techniques. There seems to be too many scenes and moments to pick out just one or two favorites; his ability to define the mood and atmosphere of a particular event through a painstaking attention to every single detail, is arguably of equal impact to the story as the performances of the actors, and make the film a visual delight. This is no less impressive when considering that THE GODFATHER was Coppolla's first major film; he was to establish himself further into the decade with other brilliant films such as THE CONVERSATION, APOCALYPSE NOW and this film's second act.When released in 1972, THE GODFATHER turned out to be, not surprisingly, one of the most widely-seen, lavishly- praised films in the history of the medium, and earned three Academy Awards out of eleven nominations (Marlon Brando's refusal to accept the award, due to the ""treatment of American Indians today by the film industry,"" has become famous in its own right). This is not to say, however, that THE GODFATHER is a film one is likely to grasp at first viewing; I, for one, did not quite understand its incredible reputation at first (though I did think it was a good film). Much as with CITIZEN KANE or BLADERUNNER, it is probably required to view THE GODFATHER through an historical context, and compare it to other films made around the same time, to get why it is so much adored. It helps matters that it's not only brilliantly made but really entertaining as well, so you're likely to have a good time no matter how you watch it."
4407,True,"The most brilliant and famous gangster crime film in history. The late, great Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Marlon Brando stars as Don Vito Corleone, or The Godfather. Introduced, and Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Al Pacino also stars as his son, Michael Corleone. They are a family that do a lot of ""business"". The Godfather is meant to help people with problems, and solve them how ever intense or simple they are. When Vito starts to feel ill Michael has to take his place until he is better. In the end Vito dies and Michael becomes the new Godfather. Also, he eliminates all of Vito's enemies to avenge his death. Also starring Oscar and Golden Globe nominated James Caan as Santino 'Sonny' Corleone, Richard S. Castellano as Pete Clemenza, Oscar BAFTA nominated Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Sterling Hayden as Capt. Mark McCluskey, John Marley as Jack Woltz, Richard Conte as Emilio Barzini, Al Lettieri as Virgil 'The Turk' Sollozzo and Diane Keaton as Kay Adams. A work of genius from Oscar and Golden Globe nominated (lost Oscar to Bob Fosse for Cabaret) director Francis Ford Coppola, with a superb sequel followed, and unfortunately the rubbish third film. It won the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Nino Rota and Best Sound, it won the BAFTA for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. Marlon Brando was number 30, and Al Pacino number 1 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Pacino was also number 26 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Brando was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, he was number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, Pacino was number 5 (along with Robert De Niro), and Brando number 1 on The World's Greatest Actor, Michael Corleone was number 11 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse.""), it was number 5 on 100 Years of Film Scores, it was number 11 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 46 on The Ultimate Film, it was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and along with the sequel, both were number 2 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!"
4408,True,"For years my boyfriend has been insisting that I watch this film - finally I did - big mistake... My issues with this film are multiple ...The pacing of the film is just terrible it's soooooooo slow and yet at the same time rushes through many things leaving many questions unanswered.Character development is beyond terrible especially when it comes to Michael Who goes from nice guy who is nothing like his family to sociopath with no shades of grey in- between .The relationships are also poor - one minute Michael is in love with Kay the next minute he's in Sicily and, in what feels like 5 minutes, married to Apollonia, then about 5 minutes later she's dead and he's home and married to Kay before Apollonia corpse is even cold...Smaller issues include the fact that Michael seems to have a black eye for approximately a year - either that or he spent about a week abroad in which time he managed to get married. Also would have been nice to know what happened to Connie after getting beaten up by her husband - clearly she must have phoned Sonny I assume.... Did she lose the child ?... Or is that the child that Michael was godfather to - if so where did Michael's 4 year old son come from.... I guess I was asleep when that was explained or maybe I'd just lost the will to live. All in all I found the film slow boring and rife withe cardboard cut out characters....My tip avoid.... Especially if you watch with someone who loves the film...."
4409,True,"The Godfather Has One Of The Best Performance Ever By Marlon Brando and Al Pacino there's a reason why this film has a 9.2 on IMDb because it's amazing one of the best movies ever made. Great Cast, Great Director and Great Dialogue the film remains on the top after so many years. The Father and Son relationship grows more as the film continues and there's a lot of character development the rest of the cast does a great job as well Talia Shire, James Caan and Robert Duvall if people love this kind of movies with Gangsters and great acting then The Godfather is the right movie for you and still the best in The Godfather Trilogy. Final Verdict: 10 out of 10"
4410,True,"Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972) is undoubtedly one of the best movies ever made because to me it was a pitch perfect mafia film that definitely compares to the greatness of Scorsese's GoodFellas (1990), and Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde (1967) but so much better than those two great films put together. The best summary for this film would be about an aging mob boss named Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in an Oscar winning performance) who in a few years time is going to retire from his position as Godfather and pass the Corleone family leadership to his reluctant war hero son Michael (played by Al Pacino in a performance that should have won him the Oscar as 1972s best supporting actor). Besides GoodFellas and Bonnie and Clyde having the most obvious thing in common with this film is that all three films talk about the mob, and the second thing that all three films have in common is that they give people who watch them how ruthless the mob can be in real life. Though I didn't read the Mario Puzo novel I understood this film perfectly thanks to all the perfectly acted performances by Brando and Pacino, but as well as Robert Duvall as the family lawyer Tom Hagen, James Caan as Sonny, as well as John Cazale as Fredo. Coppola's film not only depicts how ruthless the mob can be in some instances but also how violent the mob can be as well as those were the perfect requirements for movies like this. The one thing I really disagreed with most with the 45th Oscar ceremony is why Marlon Brando rejected his 2nd academy award for lead acting when in this movie he gave the best performance of his entire since A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) and On the Waterfront (1954), and as to why Francis Ford Coppola didn't win the Academy Award for best director when I really do think he deserved it. But in the end this film is an absolute masterpiece from start to finish."
4411,True,"Like many, I consider Citizen Kane to be the greatest film of all time. For unknown reasons, Gone With The Wind is my second favourite movie. Right behind these two is The Godfather, the mafia epic that perhaps tops more ""best of"" lists than Citizen Kane and Gone With The Wind today. As my third favourite film, I do not mind The Godfather ranking number 1 on lists and don't mind when it is raved as being ""the greatest of all time."" It is not the best in my eyes, but I can see why it would be the best in others. Anyway, my reaction to seeing The Godfather is just like anybody else's that feel mesmerized by this mammoth piece of work.The Godfather launched the careers of director Francis Ford Coppola, author Mario Puzo, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and relaunched the career of Marlon Brando. Because of early classics like On The Waterfront and A Streetcar Named Desire, Marlon Brando earned the rep as the greatest and most influential actor in film history. With a string of less successful movies right before The Godfather, Brando's greatest rival, Sir Laurence Olivier (the greatest stage actor of the 20 century), was the original choice to play protagonist, Vito Chorleone. With Olivier still a huge movie star, Brando's performance in this epic put him back on the map and gave him an Academy Award win for best actor. Others actors, as mentioned above were also nominated for other categories, but all lost. I'm glad they lost, it was such a close call that it would have been a polar-opposing house of opinions. The Godfather tells the story of the Chorleone family: the most powerful and ruthless mafia clan in America. Don Vito Chorleone (Brando) helps out whomever he feels and makes people ""an offer they can't refuse."" When drug dealer, Sollozzo approaches Vito asking for political protection, Vito, against drugs, declines. So Sollozzo and his current entourage of mob families attempt to kill Vito, which would make his son, Santino (Caan), the new Don as he wants to join Sollozzo. Instead, Vito survives and a deadly web of mob violence explodes. Vito's youngest son Michael (Pacino), is a war veteran who wants nothing to do with the family business, but as the violence rises and the family drastically weakens, Michael is the only one that can bring the family to their original status, by being more clever and deadlier than his father could ever be.The first half or so, to me, is more of a thriller than drama. Lots of suspense is created after Vito makes the rejection does not stop until after Michael kills Sollozzo and crooked cop, McCluskey. The second half is a drama as we see the family struggling with their downfall and soon rise. The story get more complex as the movie goes on, which may result in a confusion of who's who. That is why this movie needs your full, undivided attention and full concentration. It took me a few watches to completely understand. I love movies that require multiple viewings. The acting is the best ensemble ever put to film. Brando passes the torch to Al Pacino, as this was Brando's last monumental film and Pacino's first. I don't recall any other movie with such good acting by every single actor."
4412,True,"The Godfather is regarded as one of the greatest films of them all and it's not difficult to see why. It is a bit clich√© to like this movie, but it really does deserve it. Al Pacino plays the son of the head of a crime family who, following an assassination attempt on his father, rises up to become the head of the family, despite previously wanting nothing to do with his family's criminal activities. Aside from the slightly excessive length and the fact that the film made the memory of Al Pacino humiliating himself in Jack And Jill even more painful, The Godfather is one of the few films which could be seen as borderline perfect. Like many great movies, it requires patience. The film draws its audience in slowly as it gets better and more intense as it progresses and by the extremely sad ending there is a sense of awe and genuine astonishment at the quality and power of the movie. It beats Citizen Kane, the other general choice for the best movie ever made. One of the first things to set it apart is the amazing cast, although Marlon Brando is a bit difficult to understand.The direction is excellent as well, as Francis Ford Coppola's filmmaking isn't showy and visually stunning like in Apocalypse Now, but it's more subtle and restrained and draws the viewer in. The dramatic moments are handled brilliantly, and having a great script to work with certainly doesn't hurt either. What makes the film a success isn't any of the above, but the storyline. The story is perfectly structured, and gets better and better as the film progresses. Not only does it have a multitude of brilliant movie moments, it also has many jaw dropping and startling outbreaks of violence, with the multiple assassinations/baptism finale being one of the best movie moments in the history of the medium. Michael Corleone's conversion into the head of his crime family is very sad, and the movie is overall proof that a family drama can still be thrilling, moving and have people queuing around the block. I don't usually agree with the best picture winners, but this is one which totally deserved to win. Like I said earlier, it's a clich√© to love this movie but it really does deserve it.10/10"
4413,True,"""The Godfather's"" greatness extends beyond my ability to sing its praises, so there's not much insight I can offer. Except this: If you haven't seen the movie, and think like I did that you'll be disappointed doing so, see it anyway.I did. And I was disappointed, at least the first time I saw it. It was good, I thought, but not that good. Like this character gets killed off too quickly, or the movie spends too much time away from the main story following one character in Sicily, or that famous lilting melody I grew up with doesn't come up for over an hour. I thought it was good, but overrated.But then I saw it again. Wow, what a difference. Three hours flew so quickly, and I found myself totally immersed in the many different stories going on simultaneously, as well as the way director Francis Ford Coppola weaves them so effectively. ""The Godfather"" has this ability to hit you a completely different way when you see it again, because there's so much depth to what you see on screen at any given moment. But at the same time, unlike a lot of ""deep-thought"" pictures, it's wonderfully accessible, at least to a multiple-time viewer like me.The story at the heart of things is simple. A mafia family, the Corleones, are going through a rough patch. Don Vito (Marlon Brando) appears to be slipping as rival crime families vie to get into the narcotics market, which Don Vito has always eschewed. After one particularly rough gangster named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) makes a move on the Don, its up to Vito's previously clean son Michael (Al Pacino) to involve himself in family affairs and help Pop out.That the Corleones are the underdogs in this movie is part of its brilliant perversity. The movie gets you rooting for them, to the point where your journey becomes similar to Michael's. The corruption he embraces in pursuit of his father's salvation becomes something you root for, until at the end, when it culminates in an orgy of violence, you might like me get as pumped about it as you would be watching your favorite sports team pull out a come-from-behind win.Great dialogue, too, fantastically delivered. Everyone is so excellent in this movie, yet at the same time so understated. From the direction to the cinematography to the music, there's a quietness to the movie that's almost eerie, and does a lot to pull you in. Pacino, Brando, and Lettieri could all be big actors, but they all keep it contained here, especially Brando whose opening scene as the Don sets the bar very high. James Caan is the closest this movie has to an outsized performance, as Michael's hot-tempered older brother Sonny, but even he only boils up once in a while. The phrase ""It's not personal, it's business,"" comes up a few times in this movie, and the scary thing is it really is for them.Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. And if you have already, and didn't think it was that great, see it again. You may wind up as amazed as me at what a difference a second viewing can make."
4414,True,"During the 1970s, American directors decided, like their French counterparts did in the previous decade, to elevate and transcend the genres that appealed to them as children growing up in the 1940s and50s. Lucas took Buck Rodgers and Science Fiction to new levels, as didSpielberg with the Action/Adventure movie.Some re-made war movies in their own image; others re-configured the Western. Coppola took a stab at elevating the gangster film from B-movie to artistic masterpiece.On some level, he succeeded, transforming the gangster film from movies about crooks to movies about crooks and their families.Though it may not seem like such a difference, adding that familial component made movies about organized crime much more interesting than they had previously been. When critics discuss the great gangster films, few films made before the Godfather are mentioned. The Godfather, in one sense, made gangster movies as we know them. That is no small feat and Coppola ought to be commended for that. He made a solidly acted and directed film in a genre not usually known for those attributes.However, the Godfather is not the greatest movie of all time. It is not even the greatest gangster movie (that would have to go to Goodfellas) or the greatest movie of 1972 (compare it to the dynamic performances of Sleuth, the absolutely absurd and insane Ruling Class, and Bunuel's masterpiece, the Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie and you will find the Godfather lacking).Do not mis-understand: the Godfather is an eminently watchable movie, filled with great performances and guided by the sure hand of a very gifted director. It is simply, though, a very good movie - no more, no less. Perhaps I'm able to take a step back from The Godfather because I wasn't there at the timeI understand its appeal and I understand why people call it one of the greatest motion pictures of all time, but I cannot agree with them. It lacks an intangible quality that all great movies have; it lacks an aura. Movies like Close Encounters and Chinatown have an aura that, though difficult to describe, simply exudes greatness.The Godfather lacks that intangible quality while maintaining all of the tangible qualities of a great film. That one, almost invisible piece, though separates the very good from the great. That intangibleis vital and is something this film simply does not have."
4415,True,"The last time I watched the Godfather I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 and I didn't particularly love it and so I was disappointed. I wasn't looking forward to sitting through this 3 hour movie once more but I'm definitely glad that I did as the second time, the whole story became so much easier to understand.The Godfather is simply a movie that deals with the crime business within the Corleone family. The summary given on IMDb doesn't seem accurate to me as it simply deals with the lives of Michael and Vito Corleone, as well as Sonny and Tom Hagen.The greatest strength in the movie is EVERYTHING! I LOVE IT! The acting in the movie is pretty much, beyond explanation with words. Marlon Brando is absolutely a genius of an actor playing Vito, one of my favorite movie characters. Al Pacino did a fantastic job playing the young war hero, Michael Corleone. The only bit of a weakness in terms of acting was Diane Keaton, but it doesn't bother me one little bit.The writing and direction in the movie is superb. Every scene is executed at top notch and this movie is simply a great explanation of what a great movie should be like and clearly defines Francis Coppola as a superb director. The dialogue is entertaining, and unlike the first time, no scene in the movie bored me one little bit. I love the whole movie and honestly, it felt half its running time The characters in the movie are just brilliantly conjured up. They are all so great in their own ways and each have their own personalities making them unique. I love Vito, Michael, Tom, Sonny, Kay, Sollozo, the corrupted cop and everyone, including such minor characters.***SPOILERS*** When Luca Brasi and Sonny were killed off, that left such a strange feeling of emotion in me. Luca Brasi seemed like such a warrior of a man and seeing that Sonny was killed when he was on his way to kill Carlo for his actions against Connie was just heartbreaking.However, no moment in movie history affected me the same way that this scene did and that is the classic scene with Marlon Brando's Vito playing with his grandson in the garden and abruptly, falling dead. It was so beautifully done. In any other movie, this scene would feel so unrealistic that you wouldn't buy it, the fact that a mob leader's final moments were playing with his grandson but here, the scene is executed to the perfect level. It is in fact, my favorite scene of the movie The scene where Connie and Carlo's character is being baptized at the end was just a brilliant scene and was great to see some bloody action at the end of the film. The final scene with Michael lying to Kay about Carlo's murder was great and when the heads of the families meet in his room and call him 'Don Corleone' is perhaps the greatest ending to any movie along with the Empire Strikes Back **END OF SPOILERS*** In conclusion, upon my second viewing, I can gladly say that the Godfather totally deserves to be called the best movie of all time in every way possible though it may not necessarily be mine. My Flickchart list reports this movie as my 6th highest and it all comes for good reason. Superb directing, action, writing, characters and story totally pay off as this 3 hour movie for me, feels more like a 90 minute film!"
4416,True,"It is indeed a true classic and one of the best movies out there, however best movie of all time i would have to say no. It does indeed deserve it's reputation as one of the best movies of all time, however based on the fact it was number 1 on the IMDb top 250 i was a tad disappointed. I was fascinated by it's very engrossing story telling, the absolutely stunning performances and the incredible direction from Francis Ford Coppola . It's a pretty powerful movie with a lot of disturbing moments. It starts of a little slow but once it gets going it never fails to grip you. The direction is Incredible. Apart from the slow beginning the direction is flawless, with an EXCELLENT pace,awesome camera work and the way the camera moved with the characters it was great!, plus he created a great atmosphere!. There is LOTS of bloody violence. We get LOTS of EXTREMELY bloody gunshot wounds, knife in the hand, bloody gunshot wound to the head,severed horse head in someone's bed (VERY bloody), a harsh beating and , an very gory gunshot wound to the eye. The Acting is some of the best i have ever seen. Marlon Brando without a doubt deserved his Oscar for his groundbreaking performance, however having said all that Al Pacino deserved the Oscar just as much, it also was hard to understand what Brando was saying at times!. Al Pacino's performance was just as good and was also deserving of The Oscar, he and Brando had some cool scenes together and watching Pacino was just plain fun to watch!. James Caan was EXCELLENT here in his scenes here and wish he had more screen time , he is a terrific actor!. Robert Duvall is very good here with what he had to do i liked him lots. Diane Keaton is excellent here as Pacino's wife and had awesome chemistry with Pacino. Talia Shire was very good here but went a little crazy at times and she sure broke a lot of dishes! (LOL, and the rest of the cast did a tremendous job as well. Overall this indeed a true classic and one of the best movies out there however i was expecting a little too much and was a tad disappointed however i HIGHLY suggest you buy or rent this now just don't go in expecting it to be the best of all time (although a lot of viewers will probably think it is). ***** out of 5"
4417,True,"THE GODFATHER (1972) **** Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, Diane Keaton, John Cazale, John Marley, Talia Shire, Richard Conte, Abe Vigoda, Richard Castellano, Richard Bright, Al Martino, Alex Rocco. Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece of cinema and one of the most memorable films of all time: Brando (Best Actor) gives a superb performance as Don Vito Corleone, the head of a Long Island crime family who faces all sorts of dilemmas, most of which embroil his youngest son Michael (Pacino in a star-making role), fresh from WWII, who takes on the awesome task of being the next leader in crime, violence and double-crossing. Great ensemble cast and some truly remarkable moments captured on film: offering film studio head Marley ""an offer he can't refuse"" resulting with a horse's head in bed; assassination attempts and successes (Caan's hot-tempered Sonny buying the farm at a toll booth massacre the likes of ""Bonnie and Clyde"") and the piece de resistance of baptism of Michael's' godson and the wiping out of his enemies is the stuff of Greek legend. Pure filmmaking at its best. Oscar winner for Best Picture, adapted screenplay by Coppola and Mario Puzo (from his best seller) and some beautiful cinematography by Gordon Willis (suggesting a Rembrandt painting come to life). Pacino, Caan and Duvall were all nominated for Best Supporting Actor (all losing to Joel Grey in ""Cabaret""). Kudos also to make-up guru Dick Smith for his realistic old age make up on Brando and also to Nina Rota's famous haunting foreboding score."
4418,True,"***Spoilers Ahead***I read the book by Puzo before I saw the movie made out of it. I loved The Godfather in writing. I thought the characters were well thought out and portrayed. When I rented the movie, I knew that there is no way to give the whole story in four hours and make it interesting so I looked for characters and the way they were illustrated.  I looked for the way relationships were passed on to the viewer compared how it was done in the book and after all this I was very disappointed. I can forgive the movie for omitting histories about people like Luca Brasi and Al Neri. I can even forgive them for not working more with Johnny Fontane even though it was a great story that tied in well with the portrayal of Don's relationship with his Godson and how he expected to be repaid by people close to him. The movie skipped characters like Nino, Kay's parents and her background, the doctor and several others, but after all, the movie is not supposed to be a book word for word. The Godfather had great cinematography. The scenes were beautifully picked and shot. My favorite is at the end when Michael stands as Godfather to his nephew and people are getting shot all around, that was amazing. The music was cheesy most of the time, but if that was my main complaint, I could still call this movie to be great. What appalled me beyond belief is the horrible portrayal of Michael and his relationship with Kay (unfortunately it only gets worse in the 2nd movie) and complete lack of the mother's presence in the movie. Her and Kay develop a relationship. Kay becomes super Catholic and goes to church with her every morning. She ran away from Michael with his kids at some point because she was angry with him. And Michael was patient and never lost his temper with his wife. However, he was also very proud and when he returned from Cicily he did not go to her because did not expect to find her still waiting for him. And the movie failed to illustrate how much Tom Hagen was an outsider to the family. The Don lost some of his power because of Tom and that is why Michael removed him from the post. I thought that Sonny was portrayed well as were Connie and Carlo. I thought that oranges as a foreshadowing device was a great idea. The ironies illustrated in the movie like the beginning of a movie with ""I believe in America"" are all good things that made this movie stronger. However, it lacks depth and complexity. I don't understand how one can understand what is going on in this movie without reading the book first.
This movie is considered to be America's best and that should be left on its conscience."
4419,True,"How this works that impressed so put your life and your family?There is a lot of work sees boj1man loans surpassed the movie, would not continue.Vito's most precious Son Michael, the pain passed on did not want him bittenMichael would have understood better than anyone the age-old, yet beloved AnthonyDid not allow easy thing to dream, Vito's father passed on that proudGyesil show his father watching from somewhere in heaven sake do I want to have been no ..."
4420,True,"I decided to read the novel before I watched this, just to allow me to write a fair critique of the movie afterwards. I would've rated this film 10/10 if during the hospital scene, the Godfather's bed rolled down the flight of hospital stairs and out the main doors, with Al Pacino and the nurse in hot pursuit. The bed would then continue to roll down the street, rapidly gaining velocity, as the mob hit men and several police officers continued in the pursuit of him. This scene would be more enjoyable if several civilians greeted The Godfather as he zoomed past them and wished him a Merry Christmas, perhaps piling presents onto the edge of his bed, happy to see he's doing well after being shot on the streets. Overall though, this was a perfect film that followed the novel closely- I don't have many complaints."
4421,True,"I can understand on why ""The Godfather"" is being regarded as one of the greatest motion pictures of all time, if not the greatest by some professionals. ""The Godfather"" is the soul of a perfected cinema, one that will be looked upon by passionate students, and one that will be studied for generations. It is the ultra-American movie classic, which shares its place alongside movies like ""Casablanca"" and ""Citizen Kane"". Even its formidable sequel never holds the same kind of stature. To admire ""The Godfather"", is to celebrate American cinema, or just simply movies.Some time ago, I told a friend that ""The Godfather"" is a great example of a 'complete' movie, and my opinion stays in that manner still. It has everything a movie requires: cinematography, acting, editing, screenplay, directing and obviously, a glorious plot. 'Overrated' is the term adopted by some for ""The Godfather"", and my assumption is that either he dislikes the picture, or he lacks the understanding to realise the wonders of the medium. ""The Godfather"" is the first great film I caught. It is the initiator of my love for cinema. Undoubtedly, the film will always have a special place in my heart.What began and seemed like a happy family, plunges into darkness too quickly. The joy and light at the beginning are merely silhouettes of the Corleone family. Sonny's (James Caan) trifling with adultery, and the show of his temper, a man asking for murder, an unholy loyalty, and Michael's (Al Pacino) telling of his father's ways of abusing power - all these are signs shown by Coppola on the dangers that will rain down upon them. One who flirts with sin, will face a punishment.Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), who is the head of the family, is a very powerful and influential figure. With considerable loyalty that his friends pay for him, he holds the power to accomplish his ambitions. ""The Godfather"" serves introductions to the Corleone family, and only with the arrival of a narcotic baron, a spark of its drama, lighted. Although Vito portrays the main character of the story, I treat it such that the Corleone family is the 'protagonist' instead, with their businesses and goals are the greatest displays of the story.My favourite moment is a scene where Michael places his sick father in a hidden room to avoid a possible assassination. And Vito's tears flow down his cheek upon discovering that his son, has performed with utmost sincerity to keep him safe. That part, clearly magnified a genuine father-son relationship and too, the sheer love that Vito has for Michael and also a magnificent clue that Michael is the right person to succeed his father as the head of the family. No matter how villainous, or powerful or influential Vito may be, he is still an ordinary father who preserves love for his children.The movie opens up relationships between the people in the family. To witness Sonny embracing his brother, Michael, before the disinclined departure, says a lot about the soft spoken allegiance he has for Michael. And also it brings to light about loyalty and protectiveness within. Not only the story painted picture of aggressiveness of the organisation, but also about characters, that men carry.James Caan, John Cazale, Robert Duvall and the rest from the cast delivers perfect performances that have made ""The Godfather"" to be inarguably one of the best acted films in history. Marlon might already have passed terrific performances for his earlier movies like ""On the Waterfront"" and ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", but his work for the ""The Godfather"" transcended all these. His embodiment of an old, fading Don gives life for excellence and the body of an acting genius. Al Pacino is responsible for the convincing but subtle transformation of Michael from an innocent war hero, to a cold, hard ¬ñ hitting Don. That effortless changeover by Pacino is a marvellous piece of acting. John Marley is terrific as the outspoken movie producer but a very short screen time was given for him, and his performance is severely underrated.There is ""The Godfather"", living under the shades of cinematic greatness. The legacy and influence that the movie brings, endures till today. It is pretty much ironic that the greatest gangster movie is actually the one that romanticises the subject, not the ones that vomit the brutalities that many find a strong connection in between. Coppola made a statement that sounds like the movie is actually ""an accidental success"". I refuse to believe in that. I believe that the geniuses of Coppola, the actors, the writer and the filmmakers involved, that have had truly made ""The Godfather"" a timeless masterpiece.(Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com) twitter: @Alex_DeSmall"
4422,True,"I was searching through the reviews of this film and came across a couple that weren't particularly complimentary about the film. Firstly I have to say that this film is not my favourite film of all time, but is definitely in my top 3. Secondly, one person seemed to take offence of Marlon Brando's performance, that in itself is an insult as Brando was incredible in this film. Coppola's direction and attention to detail are inch perfect for me. The whole cast was brilliant in particular Al Pacino who gives an Oscar worthy performance of epic proportions. You don't just watch this film for me, you experience a whole new chapter of life that most would never experience through this film. The word epic can be overused in terms of film but this is 100% an epic of epic proportions. I agree that everyone is entitled to an opinion but get with it man, you don't get films better than this and I refuse to believe that people who have rated the likes of 'Django unchained' as close in terms of quality to this film should be allowed to comment on film in general. 10/10!!!"
4423,True,"The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather. The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie. Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and Marlon Brando's performance is absolutely flawless."
4424,True,"I grew up watching this movie and it's definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. This movie is a gangster classic that every film buff should watch.The great performances from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, James Caan other veteran actors are outstanding in this culture-changing epic. A Sicilian wedding, gun and cannolis, fishes in a vest, a horse head, a corrupt cop, the Don's demise - there are so many events in this movie that you will never get bored of it. I know I never do.I definitely suggest it."
4425,True,"Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint."
4426,True,"Godfather is one of the rare films that I watch over and over and every time I enjoy it the same as first time. It is true masterpiece in many ways from directing and acting to mesmerizing quotes and music. To me it has layers that every time I watch I find something new in it. Its interesting approach to the world of women that overshadowed under Muscular games of men mirrored the social issues of 50s in its hidden layers. The color theme in dark brown scenes reminded the Gothic era and architecture works perfectly. Men in dark rooms and covered windows taking care of their mostly illegal business. Soundtrack inspired by Italian old song comes on the task of dramatizing events moved some scenes in some scenes of violence with the hypocritical guise of characters, that lead us to a deep inferiority."
4427,True,God Father came to the best mafia movie history owes the beauty of the depth of the event although not touching the films screenwriter. Generally greater than all of the family prominent in Mafia movies keep the subject here treated as. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† But if the head is feeling lonely (in every sense) family and professional life is no longer the way it was put right. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† God Father 1 and 2 family integrity while maintaining almost 3 arises where I also ended up in the film. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† There is also something that should not be forgotten alone; When thick to go through every stage of life between the stay should be limits to what the best deals are to be considered.
4428,True,"It's a bit difficult to find a part, a moment, within the film that doesn't showcase great acting, story-telling, and a heart to what it means to have honor and pride. A well deserved film. Brando's brilliance is showcased within The Godfather. Al Pacino is a the seed that is placed within the story, who continually grows throughout by the light of his father. Although, some seeds are worth pulling. The undertone of the story is the concept of corruption and the fall of an empire, and a start to a new one. Fracis Ford Coppola's masterpiece, an everlasting mark on American Cinema. Definitely a piece of history, and you're along for the ride, and experiencing the visceral feeling of that era."
4429,True,"Legendary actor Marlon Brando and Al Pacino,a young upstart who is only appearing on his third film and second major film role star in this classic film based on the bestselling novel by Mario Puzo about the mob in ""The Godfather"". This arguably the best film made in cinema history tells the story of the Corleone organized crime family and the succession of the leadership of the family from the aging Don Vito Corleone,portrayed by Brando in an Oscar winning role, to his youngest son,Michael,portrayed by Pacino.Other members of the cast include James Caan, Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton,John Cazale and Talia Shire.The film directed by Francis Ford Coppola tells the story of how Michael's transformation from being an outsider into becoming the mob boss and how the Corleone family were able to retain the power the family has enjoyed under Don Vito against the rival families such as the Tattaglias and the Barzinis.No question that this film has remained popular among movie fans after more than 40 years it has been released theatrically. It provides a great story of the mob that was actually based on real- life gangsters and it provides the movie fan a view about gangsterism. Added to that,we also will get intrigued on the transformation of Michael from a war hero and an idealistic young man into ruthless and cold-hearted character as he assumes the position of the Godfather.The story clearly explains everything from the moment that his father Don Vito was almost assassinated until he decided to kill enemies of the family such as Virgin Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey and the untimely death of his Sicilian wife Apollonia,who was killed when the car she was driving was bombed. Aside from having a great story,there were a lot of interesting characters in addition to Don Vito and Michael such as Sonny Corleone,Tom Hagen,Kay Adams-Corleone, Connie Corleone and many others.Great performances by the thespians who portrayed them contributed a lot to these colorful characters.Finally,the script written by Coppola and Puzo remain memorable after many years as many of the dialogues continue to be popular such as ""I will given him an offer he cannot refuse"" and many others.No question that the screenplay being imitated and lampooned for so many years is a testament to its continuous popularity.After having stated all these characteristics of cinematic excellence,there is no question that ""The Godfather"" remains to arguably the best film ever made."
4430,True,"What matters is family, you pick a side and you stay on that side, if you switch side, you're the enemy and will forever be the enemy until you're dead. You look out for your family, and make sure everyone is okay. You don't discuss business at the table when having dinner. Power and Money - ""Business"" comes second! It's the Corleone family against Barzini and Tattaglia and 3 other mob leaders. The Corleone family is the biggest most powerful mafia family in New York, and the family you turn to if you need a problem to disappear. A lot of blood is spilled and Don Vito Corleone also known as the Godfather (Brandon Marlon) is almost killed in a shooting by another gang. Mike and Sonny are his sons. Sonny is his right hand at first until one day when he gets killed by a gang after going after his sisters boyfriend for assaulting her. Then Mike steps in and takes over, Don Vito gets older and more cripple and soon he dies too, that's when Mike (Al Pacino) becomes the new Godfather, and kills the 5 mafia leaders, to take control over New York, and eliminate all potential threats. Ah, I just love this movie, slow pace and leaves nothing for your imagination (sometimes I don't like that about a film, but it works in this one). Can we just take a minute to appreciate Marlon Brando's role interpretation, I love the way he worked with the body language, his voice and acting calm. And same goes for Al Pacino, just amazing! I'm so glad I finally got to see this film."
4431,True,"The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life.

The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie. Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I'm crazy."
4432,True,"The Godfather is a film of undeniable triumph; everything from the set to the sound and lighting, the score to the amazing cast, is perfect and Francis Ford Coppola's vision does justice to Mario Puzo's stylish crime novel, with the author partnering with Coppola on the screenplay. The film is a masterpiece of acting and direction, with Coppola's influence clear, and the work of stars such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall centre-stage in a beautifully dark and corrupt tale of a powerful Italian crime family. Never has the Mafia been better depicted in cinema, and I opine never will it be again."
4433,True,"A trip into the bizarre world of people who demand a ""yes"" when they make a request -- or someone or something you love will die.Marlon Brando creates an unforgettable character in Don Corleone, the patriarch and ""godfather"" of a New York crime family that thrives on such enterprises as gambling and prostitution.Corleone lives in a world of quid pro quo -- if he does you a favor, and one day wants a ""service"" from you, you must drop everything and do exactly as he wants or you will probably lose your life.The movie opens at the lavish wedding of Corleone's only daughter, Connie (Talia Shire, a sister of director Francis Ford Coppola). Various judges and politicians who had been invited are not in attendance, but they have sent gifts. The heyday of the don is on the wane and big questions arise as to how the future will turn out.When drug kingpin Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) invites the Godfather to get involved in the highly lucrative drug trade, Corleone commits the act that he refuses everybody else -- he says no. Perhaps this is another sign that the don's glory days are over. Did he really believe that he could get away with his refusal? A mafia war ensues that doesn't end until there's a new crime king in place -- the Don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino).""The Godfather"" beautifully creates the arc of Michael's evolution as a thug. He starts out as the family's first college graduate, a decorated hero returning from World War II. Michael openly describes the strong-arm tactics of his family to the girlfriend he has brought to the wedding. ""That's my family, Kay (Diane Keaton). That's not me.""However, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. And, once the Don is riddled with bullets one day while picking out some fruit at a neighborhood stand, Michael begins taking the reins, beginning somewhat tentatively when he guns down Sollazzo while dining with him at an Italian restaurant and gaining sangfroid and confidence to the point he orchestrates the assassinations of all the Corleone's enemies in one fell swoop while he is ""standing godfather"" to Connie's first child and renouncing Satan as part of a baptism ritual.The Corleones have some good, old-fashioned values but they take them to extremes. Sure, it's good to ask nicely for what you want. However, when someone like Hollywood studio mogul Jack Woltz (John Marley) says no to an offer to make an undeserving Corleone prot√©g√© the star of a film, Woltz wakes up the next morning next to the severed head of his prize racehorse.The Corleones don't believe in such elements of the social contract as waiting your turn, picking your battles, and using reason to avoid murder (as when Michael assures his turncoat brother-in-law Carlo (Gianni Russo)-- ""Please, Mike, don't do this"" -- that he wouldn't have him killed. ""You think I'd make a sister a widow? I'm godfather to your son, Carlo."" Yet, in the very next frame, he has the traitor garroted in the car that was to ferry him to the airport and a new life in Las Vegas.The Corleones abhor dissent and any airing of the family's dirty laundry. Their marriages are portraits of dysfunction: women and children reap the benefits of ill-gotten gains but never speak of them. Son Santino (James Caan) is a violent philanderer. Michael, after having returned to the US and married his girlfriend Kay, blatantly lies to her in denying that he is responsible for the murder of Carlo.A beautiful interlude in Sicily, to which Michael flees after the restaurant shoot-out, serves as a kind of intermission. There, Michael experiences the ""thunderbolt"" of falling in sudden love with a traditional local girl, whose father he strong-arms into allowing a courtship that culminates in marriage, treachery, and murder. Michael never says a word, but subsequently returns to New York. The scene seems a little commentary on the transitory nature of happiness: At any moment, it can blow up in your face.""The Godfather"" seems perfectly cast, filmed, and performed. Accompanied by one of the all-time best film scores, by Nino Roti."
4434,True,"The Godfather films (the first two at least) are operatic in their intent and are as sweeping in their view of the human condition as any American film ever made. They are not violent slice-of-life character-driven action films like Goodfellas or ""The Sopranos,"" which are a superb film and an extremely watchable cable series, respectively. The Godfather is, to my mind, superior filmmaking because of its propulsive narrative and iconic characters.What makes ""The Godfather"" great is that the characters in it know they are doing evil things, but rationalize it to themselves that ""the end justifies the means"". Coppola makes the hypocrisy and utterly failed values system pretty clear. A baptism inter-cut with scenes of murder...Vito Corleone is at his daughter's wedding, but sits there planning brutal mob stuff in his office...leave the gun take the cannoli...OK to cheat on your wife but ""dont discuss business at the table"" and so on.I had to watch this movie several times before I completely ""got"" it. The plot alone is very difficult to follow with all of the questions it raises. However it is one of those movies that rewards the viewers with those very questions for us to ponder and with its richness of story and character. The questions are about how people who regard themselves as ""good"" can do terrible things and justify it to themselves. ""The Godfather"" posits one of the universal problems in life - what is the nature of evil, and how can we recognize it in all its forms? How can people who do evil things think of themselves as basically ""good"" , how can they lie to themselves as they do?Central to all of this is the metamorphosis of Michael Corleone. He starts out as the returned all American WWII soldier with the respectable but outsider (in reference to ""The Family"") girlfriend, Kay, and by just doing what he thinks he must do to protect his family, one thing leads to another, and he ends up the cynical head of the Corleone crime family, morally miles from where he was when we first meet him."
4435,True,"A classical film, deep characters, compelling story and awesome photography. Sit down and enjoy one of the most best movies of all time.The grow in Michael Corleone is remarkable during the development of the movie. You will never feel as much fear and respect as for Don Vito in any other gangster (if one dares to call this film a gangster film) movie.And the opening scene of this movie is the material of legends. The death of Sony Corleone is the best scene in the entire movie. You could dissect this movie scene by scene and find pure cinematographic gold in each one of them.Definitively a must see for everyone."
4436,True,"I was expected a lot from this movie as it is ranked in the second place of IMDb top movies. I know that my opinion is oppose to the majority but here is my opinion. The Godfather movie is quite boring for me. The actions and everything are quite slow and in monotone. The shooting scene in the movie was radiculous and not realistic. The shooting is quite bad as it is an old movie which I understand. The story line is quite simple and quite straight. As I watched this movie, I forced myself to not fall asleep. The only good thing from this movie is the acting and also the music was on point. I would not recommend this movie for those who don't like slow pace movie or even a classic movie."
4437,True,"This film is one of the best! The acting and the chemistry between them are amazing. In this film Tony Montana is Micheal Corleone, born as the last child of Don Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, the head of the Corleone family (Spoilers!: You see more of Vito's background in the second movie) , a big family in New York. But Micheal isn't like Tony, but though the movie he does some crimes for himself. The soundtrack blends really well with the sounds of the movie, you hear it but it isn't too loud, nor it's too low. Marlon and Al really make this movie. If you haven't seen it already, well buy it on Blue ray or watch it on Netflix. It gets only better when you seen all the trilogy."
4438,True,"One of the best classics of all time, good story, with incredible acting. Even though the movie was three hours long, it's hard not finish it.The sequence of the movie flows so good in a way, the audience are always wondering what's going to happen next. Very enjoyable, even for people who don't like Mafia movies in general, because the movie discusses many things in life like family, greed, loyalty and relationships.It's a really great combination that makes the movie one of the best movies of all time, and it always be enjoyable for future generations as well."
4439,True,"In order to grasp the true depth of this movie - you have to read the novel. It's mandatory. To understand the Corleone s, the era in which they flourished & the times in which Vito made Don !!Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando is the greatest portrayal of a fictional character on screen. No one could have played him better.The adapted screenplay is optimally redesigned to keep the movie fast paced, gripping & electric with the fair share of thrills.In one scene, outside the hospital waiting for men, Michael examines his hand. It isn't shaking in spite of the fear. As in the novel, he is beginning to realize, he has a unique calm about him in times of grave danger.That is a magnificent scene, one only Coppola could have directed.I can go on and on and on .. each scene is a monument of artistry. Watch this movie before you die !!!PS: Read the novel first ...."
4440,True,"In 1968 I met the great man Marlon Brando with Charles Chaplin after the completion of 'A Countess from Hong Kong'.We all had lunch together. During our meeting I gave him a piece of amber on a leather string which I was wearing and he had admired and commented 'You are wearing the mystical stone ,20 million years in the creation'. He tucked it into his shirt. I have always wondered particularly as I watched Marlon in 'The Godfather' if he kept his promise always to wear it. I was told years later that he did ..but I have no way of knowing. Maybe someone out there knows.I was meeting the two great men in my capacity as an art dealer and they commissioned from one of my artists a portrait of Sophia Lauren in bronze..At 83 I am writing my memoirs to be titled 'SENTENCED TO LIFE'.Sir Charles and I spoke of the similarities of our beginnings..He in a Home for Waifs and Strays ...Me too...His mother confined in a lunatic asylum ..My mother too.'The Colney Hatch Insane Asylum ' in North London ..He then stated 'Remember ! From the moment we are born. We are sentenced to life'.As I wrote my memoirs 50 years later it seemed to be a perfect title .."
4441,True,"Glorious film in a glorious trilogy. Couldn't leave my bed to get a drink whilst watching this masterpiece which was a shame because I got rather parched. It was pleasant watching Mike turn from a War Hero to a cold-blooded gangster-murdering wife-beating badass. Unfortunately his brother Sunshine wasn't as lucky and received quite an excessive amount of metal shot at him but he was a bit of a dick so I was fine with that and it looked cool, good way to go imo. Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) seemed like a good bloke but changed drastically in his spin off film Apocalypse Now which also starred Vito, which took me by surprise since I thought he was probably too old and too dead to be fighting the Vietnamese commies but then again he did survive a drive-by, unlike his sun sunshine, so I don't see why he couldn't survive a small heart attack so I guess it makes sense. Overall I'd say it was a good watch although I did cry when Luca Brasi died whilst swimming, not surprised though he was a large chap."
4442,True,"It is one of those movies you can watch over and over again and not get tired of seeing the movie repeatedly. The masterpiece of film history. Higher than the first by recreating childhood Vito and his subsequent rise in the world of the mafia, played by Robert de Niro, action that would be worth an Oscar masterful, and that would lead to stardom, being considered today one of the best actors of all time, but the best. Al Pacino makes the best performance in the history of cinema. A display of how to act it would enshrine in the film world as one of the best players in history, with a solid film career available to very few. Her performance is masterful, magnificent, powerful as it was in the first, but this far exceeds the. That look like ice shivers when you see it and freezes your blood, penetrates like you two knives stabbing you, this passivity when it is in front of his wife is historical, one of the best images from the history of cinema; also master the kiss with which condemns his brother Fredo, just spectacular ..."
4443,True,"This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on a lot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family.This is definitely a ""must see"" masterpiece."
4444,True,"I haven't seen a master yet like unto The God Father, while once a pond of time in America-mobsters is OK, or Mobsters as well is good, nothing has ever came close to matching the mobster action and masterpiece of the God Father. Since my youth I love action fighting movies, boxing, kung fu, and wrestling just to name a few. Why can't they make another Master Piece like until the God Father. As they made attempts nothing has ever come close, then again I can be wrong, prove me wrong. Show me another great all time master piece as the God Father Movies. And I will surely watch them and give you my honest opinion. While the Spanish version of the God Father known as Scare Face is great, but it has nothing on the God Father. Being African America the Old God Father don't even come close or near the God Father movies, never the less I do love the super-fly, that will always be one my favorites, Please anybody show me Master Pieces like until the God Father, I'm trying to build up my collection of these great master pieces. I get too tire of watching the master piece theater, while its great, it put me to sleep sometimes. Hey if you like to contact me at artwearsusa@gmail.com or go to my website at www.artination.com and share your opinion I'll be happy to read them and watch what ever you like me to watch and I will kindly share my opinion as well about the subject. Thanks this is Calvin Bridges."
4445,True,"In my opinion, this movie was the best mob movie I have seen in a long time.The acting was suburb and the written plot was extremely entertaining. The ending were the least suspected son gets 'Don"" is really astounding and reminiscent. The suspense shown was also extremely on point, when Micheal's newly married Italian women gets killed you don't know what to think. After when he returns it puts a strain on the viewers when Vito is seen to be supporting his son being 'Don' but you can tell that he does not like that deep inside of himself. Impressive acting made the movie really stand out and the ending would make you sit there and think... is there going to be another godfather or not? I rate this movie 10/10 because of all those reasons."
4446,True,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable."
4447,True,"This movie is one that has got to be on anyone's bucket list. It is a masterpiece that will never be able to be paralleled in film making history. While it did have its moments of a little too much talk, these moments were fine due to the large amounts of action and death. Personally my favorite death was the one of Luca Brasi, where he will be sleeping with the fishes along side Solozzo and Captain Mccluskey who were of course killed by good guy Michael! The death that saddened me the most was the one of Sonny played by James Caan. With his temper he was able to keep me engaged and entertained throughout. He was probably my favorite character. But the one thing you should take from this is ""Never take sides against the family."" Be sure to check out my Youtube channel where I do many top 10 lists and its quite entertaining https://www.youtube.com/user/xAdmiralCacti"
4448,True,"Great movie, lots of emotions, incredible film. Though Marlon Brando's appearance adds up to the whole movie and makes it something wonderful, the trilogy is still great. A masterpiece and a great piece of ART. This movies travels you to the depicted age and era. It gives you the feeling of completeness although you never actually find closure in the film since nothing actually comes to an end. Wish that even more of such films would find their way to the cinemas, but these days these kinds of pieces of art are no more the main target of producers. Finally a great job by Nino Puzo for writing the novels. A fantastic job overall."
4449,True,"The Godfather is a classic movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It's about a mobster family where the whole family is involved except one, because he's a college student. The family didn't want to involve him because he had a good educated head on his shoulders. When his father is out one day, there is a mafia hit on him; however things don't go as planned exactly. Long story short, the dad ends up in the hospital and the educated son feels the need to get involved and help his father out. To my surprise, the son who didn't want to be involved finds himself completely wrapped up in the mafia lifestyle. Shockingly due to previous mob movies that were not as popular with the box office, Paramount Pictures was very hesitant to adapt this film. It was a good thing they did because this was the start up to many successful mob movies. Mario Puzo is the author of the book ""The Godfather"" and thanks to the success from the book, the movie was able to be produced. In my opinion, I love the cast. Al Pacino is an amazing actor and he is known for mafia movies. I was shocked to find out he was almost fired from being in this movie! I can't imagine what it would have been like without him. All of the cast took their roles really seriously and met a lot of mobsters to really get the feel of the role.One of the most important thematic elements is the very first scene when the bride's dad goes into the room to ask a favor from the Godfather. This is important because it shows how respected and powerful the Godfather really is. That scene was really good for character development and plot. Italian lifestyle is a big part in this movie and one of the ways its portrayed is through the language. Throughout the movie there are some parts that are fully in Italian. Even if you're not Italian after watching this movie you'll be sure to feel like you are. Violence is a big thematic element in this movie. It is constantly happening in almost every other scene. Violence and death are big parts in the Italian/ mafia lifestyle and thats how it always was and always will be. A very important scene happens right off the bat, Coppola didn't waste anytime! The father is shot, and was supposed to be killed. This is the motivation for the sons change of heart and priorities in life. Another important scene is when Michael goes to visit his father in the hospital bed. While he's in here he has his eureka moment and saves his fathers life. All in the same five minutes another important scene takes place. As Michael was leaving the hospital he runs into a dirty cop who is also in touch with the mafia, and there is an altercation, you'll have to watch to see what happens next! When Michael gets up his confidence, another crazy scene takes place. Michael became sneaky and learned the ways of the mafia. He goes into a sit down with the guys that are above him on the mafia ranking and when he goes to the bathroom he takes the gun that he planted prior to the sit-down and kills all the men at the table. Obviously this is a key point because it shows Michael's growth. The last important scene happens after a lot of deaths take place. There is really no one left in the family so the responsibility of running the family business falls into Michael's hands. This movie has a lot of story lines which only makes the movie more interesting. Obviously the mafia is a big one. In the first minute were in the room with the Godfather, the boss. Another storyline that unfolds is family relationships. The son, Michael didn't want anything to do with the mafia but once his father got involved he had to do what was right and stand by his father and help out anyway possible. Business is another storyline that keeps the movie moving. The Godfather's famous line is ""I'm going to make you an offer, you can't refuse."" Every time the Godfather says this you know some type of business exchange is about to go down.I think the director did an amazing job of putting all of these story lines together. There was never a dull moment in the film from the first five minutes to the last. It wasn't like he added unnecessary scenes or additional story lines to make the movie more interesting, everything had a purpose and had me at the edge of my seat the whole three hours!The most important relationship that is developed in this film is the relationship between Michael and not only his father, but the whole family. He was always the outcast of the family because he never wanted to live the Italian lifestyle but as the movie rolls on, he becomes closer and closer to the lifestyle and more importantly, his family. By the end of the movie Michael's life becomes the whole family business, and let's just say there's a new Godfather in town."
4450,True,"The Godfather was an excellent film. I very much enjoy a good organized crime film. I think it was a break out roll for Alpacino who played Michael Corelone the son to the Don (Marlon Brando). I must say it made me wonder if the Italian mafia world really exists, and if so is this real in-site. There were some parts that could have been left out, I did feel the wedding scene was being dragged out, I understand that was the only day the Don would grant wishes. I still give it a 10 even the beginning was a slow start. In my opinion I do believe Michael made a good Don, and we all knew once the Don had an attempt on his life he would not fully recover from it. Sonny (James Caan) the eldest son to the Don was groomed to take his father's place if a tragedy were to happen to him, so i was very surprised and a little sadden when he was ambushed and murdered on his way to protect his sister. I think this movie gave some real in-site to a gangster's paradise. It showed how the power can change from one individual to the next in a blink of an eye.How ironic the one son whom wanted nothing to do with his fathers lifestyle, who went to college and fought in the war, was the son who ended up filling his shoes. I would recommend this movie for viewing as well as Thr Godfather II to explore Michael's Journey as the new Don Corelone."
4451,True,"This is a trilogy that has Al Pacino as Michael Corleone in each one but in this film he goes from the nice, innocent boy in love who has a great respect for his father (Marlon Brando) to the leader of the family. THE DON. His transformation shows how amazing Pacino is as an actor. Him and De Niro who I consider the greatest two actors in the last 40 years both rules the 70s, they prove it again in the sequel that I don't find quite as good as the original, even though MANY people think that this is the one time the sequel finally surpasses the original in the Godfather Series.I do not.I think this first Godfather is leaps ahead of the rest, not exactly leaps maybe in front of the second but most definitely the third.While I like Heat and Goodfellas more then the Godfather I think this is a perfect 10 out of 10 for everything. The morals, the messages, the family values, the acting, the story, the action, the characters, everything in this film is flawless.This movie is one you need to be in the mood to watch due to the length and its time, but you feel slick after watching so many performances.This what film-making is all about.This is Cinema.One of the greatest movies ever made and it will be like that for years to come.A movie that will never be forgotten.A movie....you just cant refuse!10."
4452,True,"""The Godfather"" is an American Crime film, which made its debut into theaters on March 24, 1972. The film was based on the original penned by Mario Puzo, with the same title. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the film was centralized around the lives of an elite mob family in New York. Regarded as a classic, The Godfather has been an iconic American film, having been considered one of the greatest features in American films. It is a film that is multifaceted having evidence of several emerging underlying themes.The film commences with the wedding of mob leader, ""Don"" Vito Corelone's (Marlon Brando) daughter. Arriving as a decorated Marine, Corelone's son, Michael (Al Pacino) is in attendance to his sister's nuptials. Michael is adamant about his unwillingness to participate in his families' business of organized crime and is a decorated United States Marine returning from World War II. In the midst of the celebratory event, the Don has a private meeting with Virgil Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) whom requests a monetary commitment and protection to engage in a partnership within the emerging drug trade. Pursuant the investigation of a spy, it is unearthed that that Sollozzo was involved with Correlonne rivals, the Tattaglias. The denial of the opportunity sparked a fire fight between the two clans; resulting in a failed assassination of the Don. This ordeal prompted Michael, to pursue involvement within the family business. After a visitation with his father at the hospital exposed that the two hired men hired to defend the mob boss were unable to located leaving Vito vulnerable to additional attacks. During his recovery, Vito's eldest son and Michael's brother, ""Sonny"", portrayed by actor James Caan, assumes seniority and regains control of the family affairs. It was following this change-of-command that a string of mafia murders commenced.Continuation of the feuds between opposing families resulted in many casualties, including that of Sonny, was murdered en route to apprehend, brother-in-law Carlo, for brutally abusing his wife, and Vito's daughter Connie. While idling at a local toll-booth, a slue of heavily armed assassins relinquished gun fire succumbing Sunny to his demise. Away from the heart of the happenings, Michael meets romantic interest Appollonia (Simonetta Steffanelli) , in Sicily. The pair wed, however all is far from a fairy tale ending. The existence of the couple was short lived, as Appollonia was murdered in a vehicle by detonated car bombs that had been placed by assassins sent forth from the feuding families with an attempt to kill Michael.It is with these developments that you truly see the development of Michael's character.Shaped by experiences, plagued my unspoken heartbreak by losing loved ones, and embracing a life of crime which he formerly opposed. ""The Godfather,"" continues with plights of violence and opposition, as Michael assumes control of the mob's affairs. The move, has set high standards for the genre, as standards for forthcoming films will be comparable to this favorite film. Other movies represented in the same category are those are well-crafted, however, aren't comparable to the storyline and the character development that is presented within the Godfather Trilogy. Movies such as ""Reservoir Dogs,"" imitate the same violent antics that are exhibited in other mafia features, however,lack the same continuity that the Godfather possesses. As Michael is declared the new ""Don"", he seeks to relocate the business to Nevada to avenge his family, lovers, and friends. The film, is action packed with surprised lurking around every corner with unsuspecting twists that occur as a result of the gritty , unsuspecting life of a mobster. A compelling crime-drama, the Godfather, will never cease to disappoint its audience, and remains a top contender within its genre."
4453,True,"Well, I have seen a lot of movies in past, and will watch even more in the future. But, this one movie will always fascinate me.I don't know whether its it story or what? I think it's his characters. Every character in the movie, right from, Sonny to Michael has its own impact.The hero of the movie for me, was Godfather, himself and not Michael.What I like most about GF, was that he was not like we have seen Gunshots in other and most of movies. He was calm and was much like a business tycoon. He was humble and respectful.The story turns out that how a man, who wasn't and didn't want to get into all that mafia stuff, get into, for his father and family.The film doesn't have a great story, but it has grip and aura, which fascinates the viewer."
4454,True,"Mario Puzo's The Godfather is an exciting thrill ride into the 1940's mob lifestyle. It follows a character theme with additional focus on the plot. Though all five theme elements are present, this story is told with a vision into the lives of a mob family and therefore takes on the character theme. Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brandon is the head of one of New York's five mob families. He lives with the old world style and the Italian tradition that family and business issues should never mingle. At his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding it is custom of the Godfather to take requests. This sets the scene for the ties that bind this family to power. Don Vito has three sons,Santino played by James Caan, Fredo played by John Cazale, and Michael played by Al Pacino. He has one adopted son Tom (Robert Duvall) which is his personal attorney and consilere(adviser). Each of these boys with the exception of Michael is learning the family business. Michael returns home from the military unsuspecting that he will take his role in the business after his father is gunned down by drug lord Virgil Sollozzo. In return for protection and political contacts Sollozzo offers the Godfather a reasonably large profit, but despite the advice of his boys he continues with his old world ways and denies the opportunity. Sollozzo, seeing that the next in line to run the family (Santino) found this to be a lucrative deal then orders the hit on Don Vito. This sparks the mob war of all the five families and the rise of the future Don.This film in many ways is reminiscent of Donnie Brasco due to its focus on the characters in a series of events. The motifs within this film open up to the central theme of the characters by showing their power and lack of empathy when settling a score. The color pallet was not vibrant which would have been risky since the tone of the movie is more dark and sinister. The fact that this is a movie made in the 1970's as compared to the film technology of today is of no issue because you are truly lost in the actions of the characters. This film is now and will forever be iconic. It shows a blend of chaos and calm and that not all books can be judged by the cover. The reputation of the characters in this film will always be illuminated in the eye of the viewer and it will be difficult for those who have watched this movie to take them out of the characters they portray. The Godfather is a must see and will continue to be a front runner in movie history."
4455,True,"I LOVED IT! The movie was so long but had great suspense in it. The story line was ever flowing and the way the characters dealt with the situation was cleverly written and acted. I loved Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in this movie and it was a one of a kind movie that people of any nature can enjoy! So looking forward to part 2!I loved Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) for he was the Godfather and his wisdom and ways were just brilliantly thought out. His love for his family and ability to keep peace within the Dons was great! Vito had his priorities right and was unfortunate to get shot leaving his sons in charge.The beginning was superb as you got insight to how the Godfather worked and then the events that happened after with the numerous shootings, the loyalty tested, the reluctant son becoming the Godfather and the war between the mobs was just well written and put together. I loved every minute of it! It is an offer you can't refuse!I would recommend it to any adult and young adult that have a love for movies. This movie is a classic and has every reason to be. The people will need to set aside time to watch it, but once they do, it is worth it!"
4456,True,"I just saw The Godfather a few days ago. It is a classic movie. Its one of the most well-made movies I've every seen. Its every bit as good as everyone says. I may not give it the title of ""The best movie ever"", but its just as good if not better than any other ""best movie ever"" candidate. Its very realistic. Throughout much of the movie you feel like you're with the characters. You feel like your in the same room with the Mafioso's. Marlon Brando was perfect as Don Vito Corleone. I don't really think his performance could have been any better. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone was great, almost as good as Mr. Brando's (and that's saying something). Its hard to explain how great of a movie the Godfather is. You just have watch it and see for yourself. There's just something about it that makes it so believable. The scene with Michael in the bar was amazing. I thought it was the greatest scene in the whole movie. (a runner up would be the horse-head scene). There was so much tension leading up to the scene. It was almost like a mini climax. The scenes in the hospital were also very suspenseful and well-filmed. These scenes were so suspenseful that I think I jumped just when a nurse appeared. This movie is most definitely worth watching, whether you've read the book or not."
4457,True,"The Godfather is an insightful sociological study of violence, power, honor and obligation, corruption, justice and crime in America. Part I of The Godfather Trilogy centers on the Corleone crime ""family"" in the boroughs of New York City in the mid 1940s, dominated at first by aging godfather/patriarch ""Don"" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in a tremendous, award-winning acting portrayal that revived his career). A turn-of-the-century Silician immigrant, he is the head of one of the five Italian-American ""families"" that operates a crime syndicate. The 'honorable' crime ""family,"" working outside the system due to exclusion by social prejudice, serves as a metaphor for the way business (the pursuit of the American dream) is conducted in capitalistic, profit-making corporations and governmental circles.This epic story traces the history of their close-knit Mafia family and organization over a ten year period (although the specific words ""Mafia"" and ""Cosa Nostra"" are not found in the film's script - they were replaced with ""the family""). The presiding, dominant Corleone patriarch, who is threatened by the rise of modern criminal activities - the drug trade, is ultimately succeeded by his decent youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), a US Marine Corps officer in WWII who becomes even more ruthless to persist. Family loyalty and blood ties are juxtaposed with brutal and vengeful blood-letting and the inevitable downfall of the family. Romanticized scenes of the domestic home life of members of the family - a family wedding, shopping, a baptism, kitchen cooking, etc., are intertwined with scenes of horrific violence and murder contracts - a total of 23 deaths litter the film. Over 50 scenes involved food and drink."
4458,True,"Because of all the hype surrounding Godfather, I decided to take the plunge. I started out reading the book. I read the first 40 pages on a long flight. Not wanting to spend endless hours reading nearly 500 pages, I decided to watch the movie instead. I have to say I was disappointed. Godfather is basically a soap opera shortened to 3 hours.First, there's too much dialogue. Godfather's probably 10% action and 90% talk. It wouldn't been so bad if you could understand the conversations, but I found myself constantly missing out on something and having to rewind. I particularly got lost when the Don meets the Sollozzos for the first time. This conversation was one of the most important parts of the film, yet I heard nothing but mumblings.The jumbled storyline doesn't help either and not much makes sense. Michael's activities in Italy, his business dealing in Vegas, and him beating up a guy in the street had absolutely nothing to do with the plot. Why the hell those scenes even added? I have never seen a movie that conveyed so much confusion to their audience.The acting was excellent though, but as one has already mentioned - lacked depth. Godfather had little character development and the characters do not have distinct personalities. I swear you couldn't tell Michael or Sonny apart. I think this was more the fault of the scriptwriters or director. Also the chemistry between Kay and Michael just wasn't there. Their marriage at the end seemed odd because of the poorly scripted relationship between them throughout the film.A good movie in my definition should be one that can be interpreted by even a ten year old. Too often, the movie conveys too little information and expects you know everything that's going on.I do have to say the movie has an artistic quality to it. The setting and camera-work beautifully done. And as I have said before, the acting was top-notch. Unfortunately the negative aspects doesn't make up for it. When the movie was over, I couldn't believe it was over. I was like, that's it? I was expecting so much more, especially for being a top ranked movie on IMDb.If you want to see a real movie/show, watch Prison Break."
4459,True,"All these years people have been praising this film to no end. Yesterday I watched it for the first time just to see how good it really was.First I feel quite disturbed. All the brutal shooting, wife beating, and all forms of killing and hurting made me quite uncomfortable. To me, it makes no sense to glorify violence to such degree.Put the excessive violence aside, this movie is not bad. I was not bored at all while watching it. But do I get the same satisfaction after watching Schindler's List, Taxi Driver, or Lord of the Ring series? Not really. Will I see it again? Probably not. To me, once is enough."
4460,True,"`I believe in America' are the first words spoken in The Godfather. The fact that they resonate with such power to someone who has no personal or professional ties with the country speaks volumes. My first viewing of this film was anticipated with equal amounts excitement and trepidation. How could a film of such enormous stature possibly live up to anyone's expectations, let alone mine? Over two and a half hours later I realised I would probably never see a finer film in my life. And about six or seven years on from that revelatory experience, that view grows ever stronger. With the exception of The Godfather Part Two that is. But that's a film for another day. The Godfather is now so much a part of our culture that it becomes difficult to talk about it as a film by itself. Entire books have been written on how it has not only affected change in the way films are conceived by individuals and whole studios, but also the very nature of the film industry itself. At the time nobody could have predicted that a lengthy (and costly) film set in the 1940's with a relatively little know cast and a serious and weighty subject matter could have made such a huge profit at the box office. Much like in the film itself, ambition and bravado is rewarded with great success and power, and this was true for many of the cast and crew with their subsequent careers. There may be spoilers ahead but the plot and events in this film are now so well documented I doubt anyone will be surprised.The film opens with a wedding taking place between Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie and Carlo, a wannabe member of the Family. While the celebrations take place outside in glorious sunshine, in the darkened rooms of the main house Don Vito pays court to various people requesting help with whatever problems they need assistance with. This is where Bonasera, a local baker, opens the film with the aforementioned line and seeks revenge on two men who savagely beat his daughter after she refused their advances. The subsequent conversation sets the tone for the rest of the film. Respect is always demanded from those in power and who are willing to use that power to benefit you. But there may always be a favour required by The Don in return. Later in the film, this favour is repaid to The Don in a way that is both shocking and relieving to Bonasera. Every element in this first scene demands attention from the audience and rewards them by setting a very high standard thereon. The way the camera slowly pulls back from Bonasera to reveal The Don listening to the story as we are, the use of lighting to almost hide The Don's eyes in the darkness, and the expressions, the voice and even the movement of Marlon Brando as The Don immediately put us in the company of one of THE great acting performances. Also attendant at the wedding are The Don's sons, Sonny the firey tempered James Cann, the weak willed Fredo played by John Cazale and Michael, the youngest and most cool headed of the brothers, played as such by Al Pacino. As with Brando, you are assured career defining performances by all three men, and I don't think any of them reached these acting heights again. Equally impressive but not strictly a family member is Robert Duvall as The Don's Consilgerie, Tom Hagen. In a nutshell (if such a thing were possible) the film follows the reluctant but necessary rise of Michael to the head of The Family and his dealings with his immediate family, his wife Kay (Diane Keaton), the ranked members that protect their Family (Tessio, Clemenza, etc), other Mafia Families and corrupt  state officials. Throughout the film Michael's views on his involvement with his Family change from the events that happen to his father after The Don refuses to involve his Families resources in distributing drugs into the city. When The Don is gunned down and left for dead in the street, and Michael has his jaw broken by corrupt Police Captain McCluskey, whilst trying to protect his unguarded father in the hospital, he sets in motion the revenge killing of both McCluskey and Sollozzo, the man partly responsible for the attempt on Don Vito. The result of the ensuing incredible set piece makes it necessary for Michael to leave the country to Sicily until it is safe to return. There he experiences both happiness and tragedy, as he takes a new bride, Apollonia, and receives news that Sonny was killed for a hit he had ordered on a rival Families son in previous retribution for the hit on The Don. Sonny's death scene is itself one of the most memorable set pieces in all of cinema. When a failed attempt on Michael leaves Apollonia dead, he returns to America, cold and hardened by these terrible events. There he begins to pick up where he left his life with Kay and moves to become his fathers heir. The phrase that there is honour among thieves is nowhere more relevant than in The Godfather. Michael, Sonny, Fredo and Tom are bound together by the respect and loyalty they hold for their father (in Tom's case, unofficially adopted) and the Corleone name. Their Family will always come before anything else, as shown when Michael leaves for Sicily without much of a thought towards Kay (being both Jewish and a woman excludes her from the Family), or when Sonny rushes to his sister Connie's aid (and ultimately his demise) after she receives another vicious beating by Carlo.
Some of the most fondly remembered and famous scenes in cinema occur throughout The Godfather. The sequence with Khartum's severed head is an undisputed classic for both the shock value and for showing us early on how far and what type of methods the Family will employ. Sonny's murder is brutal and affecting, the attempted hit on The Don is wonderfully staged with the camera looking down on the event from above, the cumulative killings of the heads of the five Families at the end is a masterpiece of editing (note to George Lucas circa Phantom Menace. This is how you direct separate climactic events that reach toward the same goal!) , and these are only some of the major events that take place. There are so many great lines that it would be fruitless to list even some of them here, as many of them are now as much a  part of the English language as any piece of classic text. What I will mention however, are the delivery on some of the lesser known phrases. When Tom has to tell The Don that `They shot Sonny on the causeway. He's dead', it's a heartbreaking moment both for himself, The Don and the audience and we can completely emphasise with their pain. The fact that we can emphasise at all with these criminals and killers is not only due to the acting, writing and directing of these characters, but that the Corleone Family is just that shade more moral and honourable than the other Families depicted in the film. When The Don calls a meeting with the heads of the five Families to clear the bad blood between them and prepare for Michael's return to America, his delivery of the line `..but I'm a superstitious man..' and subsequent warning is so powerful and commanding that nobody but Brando could have pulled it off with such weight and grandeur. When Michael asks the powerful Vegas hotel owner Moe Green that `You straightened out my brother?' the ¬ëthreat' is so tangible that Moe is immediately sorry and Fredo tries to make light of the situation by assuring Mike that he and Moe are best of friends. Thus begins the tragic downfall of Fredo¬Ö At the beginning of the film when Michael is telling Kay about his family he assures her that `That's my family Kay, it's not me'. At the end of the film he tells her `Don't ask me about my business Kay'. Both times he is completely sincere and believable. All throughout the film there are little moments where there may not be any dialogue or anything particularly important that happens to the plot, but they made such an impression on me that I have to mention some of them. The moment when Sonny bites down on his fist so (I assume) he wouldn't swear in front of Connie when he sees the bruise marks left on her face by Carlo, gave me goosebumps. The shot of the Statue of Liberty in the backdrop after Clemenza takes Paulie out to pick up some Cannelloni and has Rocco kill him and leave him bleeding in the car. The simple shrug of The Don's eyebrows when Tom returns from meeting Jack Woltz, and the previous shot was hearing Woltz's continued screams after finding the head of his beloved horse Khartum, in his bed when he awoke. The impeccable way Michael looks, dresses and carries himself when we first see him after returning from America as he steps out of a car toward Kay, and the way Brando's face literally crumbles as he is told of Sonny's death. Every technical element in this film is of the highest level. The cinematography is beautifully composed and framed, the period designs of New York are utterly believable and we never assume we're in any other time. The music is simply stunning and perfectly highlights the mood of the characters throughout, with the main theme one of the most recognisable pieces of music in cinema. When watching this, the film simply FEELS rich. I take a great sense of importance and history from it, as though it's not merely a film but something much bigger. And there are plenty of arguments to support this, given the massive impact it has left not only on the film industry, but also on American businesses, commerce and crime. There are many stories of real life Mafiosi who base their lifestyle and way of conducting business on the Corleone way. I think the best compliment I can pay to The Godfather is that once the door is closed on Kay's face and we've both been shut out, I feel like I've witnessed an event, rather than just watch a film."
4461,True,"Possible SpoilersI did have high hopes for this film (because it's at number one on this chart), but after about 40 minutes into it I think it's the most boring film I have ever watched. In my mind it's just a bunch of people talking total nonsense all the time and how on earth Marlon Brando got a best actor Oscar for what seems to be 10 minutes on screen time I will never know.The only scene I liked from this movie is in the cafe I think it is, when Michael kills those two people in order to even the score for his father, and to be perfectly honest about 1 hour and 10 minutes into the movie I decided to stop watching it, otherwise I would have thrown myself out the window, that's how bad this movie is to me.I did try to like it but you cant please all of the people all of the time can you, and the last thing I want to say is that if this film was so bad, I would dive off a cliff rather than see it's sequel.In my personal opinion."
4462,True,"One of the most critically acclaimed films in all of history, The Godfather shows us inside the world of the mob. But not in a usual way. The main character Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the crime lord of the biggest crime family in Ney York, but the film portrays him as an honorable person. He never really does anything that we can look down on him for. He has a strict moral code and always spends him free time with his family. He is an elderly man who has 3 sons and 1 daughter. Michael Corleone (Al Pachino) wants nothing to do with the crime family, Sonny Corleone (James Caan) is a hothead, Fredo Corleone (John Cazale) is a weakling, and Connie Corleone (Talia Shire) is Vito's only daughter. The story really begins when Vito refuses the request of local drug lord Virgil Sollozo (Al Lettieri) and as a result, Sollozo attempts to kill Vito. With Vito in the hospital Captain Mark McCluskey (Sterling Hayden) a corrupt police officer working for Sollozo arrests all of Vito's bodyguards leaving Vito unprotected. With Sonny as the acting don, Michael goes to visit Vito in the hospital but as he is leaving McCluskey shows up and attempts to arrest Michael but not before Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) the Corleone's lawyer shows up to save Michael. Later after convincing Sonny, Michael stages a meeting with Sollozo and McCluskey in a restaurant but in a life changing moment shoots them booth in the head. From that point on the film showcases the evolution of Michael from the college kid he was before now to a ruthless mobster. This film is one of the most celebrated and critically acclaimed in history, and it's easy to see why. The characters here are all great. The acting (which is important because that's what makes the memorable characters) is equally great. Brando in fact won an Oscar for his performance as Vito. If you ever come across this movie, stop and watch it."
4463,True,"The Godfather is the greatest film ever made.It has the greatest critical and commercial successes in Hollywood as it gets everything right and has no shortcomings whatsoever.It exceeded expectations as the Mario Puzo's novel,from which the film was based on which itself a classic,and it also created a new standard and benchmark for the great American movie.Aside from that,it was one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time.In summary,it is the movie that provided the greatest on both excellence and entertainment.The story begins as Don Vito Corleone,the head of a New York Mafia ""family"", oversees his daughter's wedding. His beloved son Michael has just come home from the war, but does not intend to become part of his father's business. Through Michael's life the nature of the family business becomes clear. The business of the family is just like the head of the family, kind and benevolent to those who give respect, but given to ruthless violence whenever anything stands against the good of the family. Don Vito lives his life in the way of the old country, but times are changing and some don't want to follow the old ways and look out for community and ""family"". An up and coming rival of the Corleone family wants to start selling drugs in New York, and needs the Don's influence to further his plan. The clash of the Don's fading old world values and the new ways will demand a terrible price.The epic film stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte and Diane Keaton, together with John Cazale and Talia Shire.The film benefited greatly from the performance from its stellar cast especially from Brando as Don Vito Corleone,the head of the New York Mafia ""family"".Also,the actors who played his sons like Pacino as Michael,Cazale as Fredo and Caan as Sonny,were also outstanding in their performance. The cast was simply superb in this film.Other unforgettable features of this film is Nino Rota's haunting and memorable musical scores;the editing by William Reynolds and Peter Zinner;Dean Tavoularis's evocative set design; and the screenplay of Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola as well as the direction of Coppola. Overall,The Godfather is the ultimate family film that member of the household will enjoy and could relate to."
4464,True,"There might be many movies made since the inception of cinema and trust me wen i say that I have seen superb cinema of many ages and of many genres but never have I come across a movie like the Godfather. It just is the perfect synonym for cinema which can change your life.It is no secret that The Godfather has impacted so many moviegoers and made them into successful film makers or at least aspiring film makers. There are so many things which can be written about the genius of the Godfather.But the most striking thing which has to be mentioned is the perfect transition of the book onto screen.The book has been adapted so well that the movie seems better than the book in some frames.Mario Puzo and Coppola have collaborated so well that its a product of genius. Now we have heard a lot about the casting,but what can i say.I feel I am nothing to speak about the acting prowess of Marlon Brando.I have never come across a performance so spell binding with an amazing screen presence.Brando was Don Corleone will remain etched in every body's mind as the perfect man for the role. Al Pacino was simply sensational.The way he portrayed his emotions are a joy to watch on screen.His acting to me has to shown to every aspiring actor because its such a powerful act which just refuses to fade away from your memory.The supporting cast of Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and James Cann as Sonny are exemplary. The back ground score and cinematography is of the highest class. And the dialogues are just extra ordinary.For example dialogues such as, i will make him an offer he cant refuse.I will reason with him are just so powerful but yet so subtle. Mafia was never so stylish nor powerful.It is a movie to watch for every film connoisseur because until one does not watch the God father he cannot know or cant fantasize A PERFECT MOVIE. a work of absolute Genius.I believe everybody associated with the movie is so god damn proud of himself for having his name attached to it. and I am proud of being a FANATIC of the Godfather."
4465,True,"I had to watch the entire trilogy and reflect on the films for a while before I realized what a great film ""The Godfather"" is. As I watched all three films, I really got familiar with all of the characters and became more intrigued as the series went on. Looking back, I felt that this first film was the greatest of the trilogy for several reasons. First of all, it has Marlon Brando, who portrays the amazing character Vito Corleone. This is one of the most memorable, imitated, and lovable characters in film history. His character is masterfully balanced as a powerful mafia patriarch and a loving family man. For this he won a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar. I also prefer this film because Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is a hero rather than the villain he later becomes. As Vito Corelone is wounded by an enemy, Michael must take over leading his empire while he is recovering. The interactions between the characters is excellent here, as is the film's dialogue. There is also a great supporting cast, consisting of Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and more. What a well-crafted story. Part II is almost as good, but I think this is slightly better. Close to perfect.***1/2 out of ****"
4466,True,"Well what can i say? A great cast, a great director and a great film. This surely has to be one of my all time greats, beautifully acted and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, in a sense that its almost ubelievable to believe that a director could achieve this. The cast line up includes Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino and Diana Keaton. Marlon Brando gives an extraordinary performance as Don Voto Corleone aka the Godfather. With its breath taking story line and emotional story telling and a stellar cast.What more can you ask for this emotionally gritty drama. And the answer is nothing, because this is to as near perfect film making you are going to see. Don't MISS ME"
4467,True,"Imagine a room full of seasoned movie goers and critics. The topic of discussion - what movies are the best ever? And the name that unanimously pops up as a strong contender for the top spot - The Godfather. With an incredible star cast, an incredible director (Francis Ford Coppola) and a strong story (Mario Puzo) this movie surely deserves all the praise that it can get.The Godfather is a three hour movie based on the life of the Italian American Mafioso based on the original novel written by Mario Puzo, who also has written the screenplay along with Coppola for the movie as well. It stars legendary and highly respected actors namely Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, etc.What makes Al Pacino's role particularly tough is the evolution and the development of his character. He starts out as a person who does not want to do anything with the family business and as circumstances change he gradually changes the direction of his life and evolves throughout the movie. And Pacino does it splendidly. Surely his acting skills are not overrated as some might feel.The story is a depiction of bitter reality, a bitter reality that was already put forward in the novel and made more accessible and imaginable in the movie. Perhaps this also explains why some haters of the movie exist. It does not offer the escape from reality many other movies seem to offer and let us face it - it is not a simple, straight story to understand. Though 3 hours in length, many viewers could watch it over and over again and each time a viewer watches it he might understand it in greater depth.The direction is near flawless. This is one huge reason why this movie is always critically on the top spot. Incredible research has been done by Copolla and Puzo in depicting the Mafia world. How does a Don think? How does he protect himself by organizing layers and layers within his empire that render him untouchable by the law? How insecure does he feel? What does he consider when he plans a move? How careful does he have to be in every step that he takes? How does he exploit the whole system around him in order to be the one controlling all the strings (please note the puppeteer's strings in the logo of the movie The Godfather)? These are some of the questions both the movie and the novel try and answer.For those of you who have read the novel, I am pretty sure most of you will not be disappointed. It is the best example of how best can a movie be made out of a splendid novel! And for those who saw this movie and liked it, I'd suggest that you read the novel as well for it shall explain in even greater depth the subtle details of the working machinery of the Mafia empire. And yes, please see The Godfather 2 as well.And may I also add in the end that the second part ""Godfather 2"" is a fulfillment of the first. A must watch for every person who has watched part one.I am sure that this movie is going to retain the honour of its top spot and critical finesse for many years to come."
4468,True,"The Godfather has influenced every gangster film that has been made since. In terms of mannerisms, quotes, story line and characters.Vito Corleone is also known as Don Corleone, who is the head of the Corleone Crime family, who are one of the five crime families in the Italian Mafia that rule America. Don Corleone meets a drug dealer named Sollazzo who wants to make a deal involving narcotics, the Don who has old fashioned value see's this as a threat and rejects the offer only to be gunned down. The Corleone kids, Sonny, Tom, Michael and Fredo must unite to hold their family and organisation together. And for Michael the youngest, things will never be the same again.The Godfather is a masterpiece. There are endless scenes in the movie that strike a strong and powerful cord with the audience. From the first scene which shows Don Corleone sort out a problem to the violent death of his son and the rise of Michael.Although made in 1972, still connects with people today. Its a different type of family movie like someone previously reviewed. It holds a strong sense of loyalty and what one will do if they are pushed beyond their limits. The cast is perfect; Marlon Brando is amazing as the ageing Don, while James Caan plays the hot headed Sonny perfectly and Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall give a great performance. But it is Al Pacino who shines. He portrays the innocent young man who vows to never be like his family only to plunge himself into darkness in order to protect his beloved family.A masterpiece. A masterpiece that has effected the world when it comes to gangster movies."
4469,True,"""The best film that's ever been made""That's a lie by my book. This film is - yes, I think I'll go as far as to say this - bad, in many ways.Where do I start?1. Poor acting Brando was the only saving grace in this film, and the only reason I saw it through to the end. The rest of the cast were not good. I wanted to tear my eyes out and cut my ears off every time James Caan came on-screen for instance. Al Pacino was awful too. No chemistry in my opinion.2. BORING Seriously, I was on the verge of turning this movie off; there were no engaging elements to the film or story.3. It was very cheesy There are no words to describe this aspect, just...cheese all over.4. An incredibly annoying score I've read comments calling the score a ""classic"". I don't find a score that consists of bringing in the same high-pitched melody in over and over again, ""classic"".All in all, what are the people of the world thinking, ranking this movie so high?!1/10, purely because of BrandoScorsese does it a million times better..."
4470,True,"I could not maintain concentration throughout that film. When I heard it was on, I had high expectations. But I was throughly disappointed with how boring it was. I can't see how it was so good, it's just a load of Italians in America killing others. So boring I decided not to watch the last hour.I will admit that the scene where the police captain and the drug guy was shot was quite good. The uncertainty of whether the gun is there or not is well produced and the effect with the white noise sounding like blood rushing through your ears was much more effective than the lame heart beats that you get it some films."
4471,True,"I'm a modern type of movie viewer, but I can appreciate classics, like ""Annie Hall"", ""Midnight Cowboy"", ""Forrest Gump"", ""Casablanca"", etc. I simply do not understand what people see in ""The Godfather"" To start with, I'm not really into the whole crime mob Italian Sicilian Naples mafiosi family thing, so it didn't have my attention at that. The acting was good, but Marlon Brando was annoying--his weirdy voice is infamous, but I couldn't understand anything he said! It sounded very flaccid and emotionless, too.The story itself seemed very pointless... Michael Corleone kills a bunch of people, mob hits, his father gets shot or something, he becomes the new Godfather or something. Nothing had shown itself much changed or resolved. Didn't serve a purpose other than to show a bunch of cursing and killing. With thick accents.The mood was also very very cold-hearted. There's a general complaint about Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"" that it's very cold, too, that the characters don't have a warmth to them that you can identify with. ""The Godfather"" characters are like this too. You can't identify with any of the characters because they seem so heartless and cold, not even with a hint of charm to them to make you like them, except maybe Marlon Brando, who seemed like a crazy old grandpa who's half-senile.I can't see the classic status of this movie. If it were released today, would it receive the same praise?"
4472,True,"IT was good for its time yeah sure but do you really still think it deserves #1 of ALL TIME!!?? I just think there are better films out there ones with more action, suspense,special effects ( i know it was low budget),actors etc. There just seemed to be more dialogue than anything else in the film put together. If you showed this to the younger generation then they would simply not be impressed. There are bigger titles out now and why is everyone still voting this in? It would be much better to vote the lord of the rings trilogy in the top 3 or put the shaw shank redemption at #1 that would make more sense. I would personally put ""The Godfather"" at #5 seeing as it does have the best title for a film of all time."
4473,True,"In the beginning, a young war hero tells his future wife, how his father helped a successful crooner in his career, by making his manager an offer he couldn't refuse : basically threatening him to death with a gun on his head. Through a true story, he was revealing a secret that showed how menacing is his family, and how different he is. At the end, not only did he threaten his brother in law, but he killed him, and when asked by his wife, if it was true, he answered: 'no', concluding one of the most fascinating characters' arcs in a movie. What happened in between is just the greatest cinematic metamorphosis, pure magic.This is not the story of a pure soul being corrupted, but the story of a soul whose only choice in order to protect someone dear was to become like him and therefore to realize that the crime that inhabited his father's life, not only could be justified, but ultimately, was the only destiny that could allow him to succeed. This is the irony of the American Dream, of a man who parodied the capitalism to underline its own limits, the same limits that ultimately built his power. An irony that inherited his youngest son, who lost his soul for the sake of blood loyalty: losing principles for the sake of mightier principles.The fact is that some principles transcend the conventional ones, and if the father didn't want to be a puppet, he had to be the one who pulls the strings, like Presidents who don't pull the trigger, to be the ones to declare the war. More than an iconic cinematic allegory, the strings symbolize the tight frontier between being a legitimate politician and a respected criminal, in other words, being Vito Corleone. Being the master who gives you protection, in exchange of loyalty, letting you act knowingly that everything is under control. That's the point, with Vito, everything is under control. When he promises that the two thugs who brutalized a poor undertaker's daughter will get their comeuppance, we know he'll do it. Now, the question asked in the beginning is : which of his three sons will succeed to this exceptional man?The answer relies on one scene. Michael kisses his father's hand, in danger in the hospital, and tells him respectfully: ""I'm with you, Pop"" and a tear runs in Vito's face. His son is protecting him and for some reason, we're almost sure that his father will survive, just like with the undertaker. The only man who inspired the same level of confidence than Vito is his son, Michael, who's (ironically again) the civilian, the non criminal. Not because the other sons were not meant to be Dons, the older one was Sonny, hot headed, good hearted, the other was as good hearted but weaken minded, both were criminals in a way or another. Michael was the one because he had to be. More than a story of succession, it's a story of destiny.And ""The Godfather"" is one of the greatest evolutions that ever enriched the silver screen. Mainly because of this story that everyone could relate to, one who loved his family and whose only choice was to corrupt his soul to protect it. It's not about crime, it's about the very necessities that make crime, not legitimate, but justifiable. It's not about crime; it's about its roots. It's not a crime or gangster movie, it's a movie where the crime setting highlights some principles like blood loyalty, friendship, or family that would have been meaningless in a more legitimate world. This is the thought provoking genius of ""The Godfather"", that made it so universally appealing, because people from every cultures respect values like courage, loyalty, family, and respect itself.The nature of the story is just one of the pillars on which the greatness of ""The Godfather"" has built its legend ... and I focused on this because the rest has not to be proved: the acting, the direction, the music, the quotes, the characters, the cinematography ¬Ö every analyzable element is a living proof of the movie's closeness to perfection. Why should I develop this? If you read these lines, you know what I'm talking about, so let's keep this prudish and not try to be too enthusiastic. How ironic that the movie was based on a kind of pulp fiction novel ¬Ö How ironic that the direction that made the movie with such confidence was so imperceptible ¬Ö Indeed, Coppola makes us feel as part of this family, of the Corleones, they are criminals, yes, but the intimacy helps us to root for them ¬Ö But another irony is that the direction is still present by these little details that gave the film its legendary feeling, every single death occurring has a little something that makes it memorable, from Khartoum's decapitation, to Sonny's ambush, from the restaurant to the baptism scenes, not to forget the two strangulations that opened and concluded the human deaths' series. The details are everywhere, in the script that enriched the cinematic language with so many iconic quotes, from delightful culinary parallels to other fishy metaphors ¬Ö a script that transcended the novel, and made the film even more legendary.When it comes to defend ""The Godfather"", I'm the most passionate fan you'll ever find, but I prefer to prevent this review from an overdose of superlatives. I know the movie is the greatest, not because it's my personal belief, but because I can't see another movie to top it, whatever cinematic category I use : story, acting, casting, writing, scoring, editing, direction ¬Ö I can find a movie better in every element but not in all of them, and beyond all this technicality ¬Ö it's just a movie that grows on you, after so many viewings, that shines cinematic respect in every single frame. The greatest ¬Ö"
4474,True,"The story begins as ""Don"" Vito Corleone, the head of a New York Mafia ""family"", oversees his daughter's wedding.

It has great masterful acting, excellent actors and lines, terrific script and the ending is a WOW!!!!!!!!!!!! Rated R for Extreme Graphic Violence, Profanity, Sexual Situations and Brief Nudity."
4475,True,"There is no denying that the Godfather is a classic and one of the best movies ever made. It is a saga of a major Mafia father, the upper echelons and there struggles. It starts with Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) on the day of his daughter's wedding and doing favours for people invited to the wedding. The films shows the outcome of these favours, including the famous sense of the horse's head in the bed. The film then shows Vito refusing to take part in selling drugs and ends up having an assassination attempt against him. The Corleone family is forced into a tuft war before peace is made. At the same time the Godfather shows Michael's (Al Panico) rise in the family, from being a bit of an outsider not wanting to get involved to becoming the head of family after Vito's death. The film shows how person relationships developed and shows the characters as real people. It shows how the Mafia would have worked in the 1950s, focusing on deal making, rising up the ranks and showing acts of violence being conducted.The gangster film was not a new genre, their were good films in the film noir period such as Scarface, Little Caesar and the Killing. However I am not aware of any major gangster films in the 60s. The Godfather focused on the characters and many different and complex plots and subplots. It was able to bring in more violence into the genre because by the late 60s films were allowed to show more violence. The film also benefits from a brilliant script, the excellent direction of Francis Ford Coppella (this film along with The Godfather Part II are his best films) and a brilliant cast. Marlon Brando was brought back into the mainstream after gaining a reputation for being an ego-maniac, and help made the careers of Al Panico, James Caan and Diane Keaton. This was also the first film I aware of focusing mainly on the Mafia and how it functions. I remember watching a document on the making of the film on Channel Four and how difficult it was for the filmmakers, fighting with the Italian-American community.The Godfather and Godfather Part II are both classics and must watch films. I admit I have not watched Godfather Part III but that because I heard it wasn't as good and ruins the first two. It has been very influential in the gangster genre afterwards. They was Once Upon A Time in America which was similar in it approach, having many story lines and themes and similar filming of violence. They was Goodfellas which forced on foot-soldiers of the Mafia and set mainly in the 60s and 70s when it was filmed in the 80s. They are also films like Casino and American Gangster, the list goes on. They are also parodies such as Family Business and programmes such as the Simpsons, Futurama and Family Guy. Finally their was the Sopranos (one of the best programmes ever made), mixing elements of the Godfather and Goodfellas. All in all the Godfather is a very important film."
4476,True,"The entire scale for this movie is huge, and every scene carries emotions with it. The acting is amazing, as is the score and direction. So, what's wrong with it?SPOILERS FOLLOW
First of all, people get their hopes up so high when they see this film that, it's to the point, if it doesn't change their life it's considered to be boring and dated. But, also, people also down vote it when it threatens the popularity of their trendy LOTR flicks and other movies that make you 'cool' if you like them.Acting - Brando was so subtle and yet had such a dramatic impact on the way acting was done. I have images from this film that I remember, and mostly I remember Brando holding the cat in the opening scene. His voice has influenced modern film and television - as almost every show on television has paid homage to the father of all film. Score - The score is haunting, and somber in all aspects of the word. It builds emotional tension and it has a pay off. The main theme is amazing and is beautifully put together and is always in the right context when it shows up in the film. It's beautiful, and I strongly urge you to get the original soundtrack.Direction - Francis Ford Coppola took a very subtle and consistent approach in bringing this film to life. Think of Michael in the diner with Captain McCluskey and Sollozzo, as the train is perfectly timed in going by, before Michael (in Al Pacino's career making performance) explodes with rage. It is so apparent in his face, and we feel as he does -- nervous yet we still anticipate. Story - The script is very well written, adapted from the brutal book by the brilliant Mario Puzo. The story of the film was ahead of it's time - and it still is. While being played on television today there are still people who refuse to like this simply because it's hyped. They try to go against anything that's popular in an attempt to look cool. It doesn't work - so give me The Godfather over Pulp Fiction (and all of the hip crime film copy cats that it spawned. i.e. The Usual Suspects [which is ranked higher than ON THE WATERFRONT] -- what is wrong with our society?)
Everything is perfect as we become immersed in the world of the mafia boss Don Vito Corleone, and we're along for the ride as well follow him through a few years of his life. This film changed the way I saw art within movies.
Yes, I hated it the first time I watched it. But, for some reason, felt I should watch it again. On the second viewing it was confirmed; I hated it. I trashed it everywhere, including on this site, and made it sound like the worst movie ever made. Boy, how much I've grown. I trashed it because I didn't want to be caught up in the frenzy this movie has produced. It created a whole spawn of copy-cats and followers trying to capture the art as The Godfather did, and sadly, it will never happen. This will never be duplicated or surpassed in any sense. From start to finish I am completely captivated at the imagery, the music, the brilliant acting, and the underlying script that holds so much warmth, and brutality.For any true fan of film - do not hate this simply because you want to be 'different' from others and look like some sort of outsider since you went against society by not liking a great movie just to prove how original you are. Face it, you're not original - you're doing the same thing others have done when it comes to this film for years, and as I once done as well. All of these kids who hate this film will have the hip movies in their best of lists, and you can figure out their personality from reading them.Their lists will have these films on it:The Shawshank Redemption (another reason why people try to hate The Godfather; Shawshank is their favorite film and it burns them inside to see The Godfather best it in the top spot)Fight Club (hip and trendy, violent and against society. What more could an angst filled teenager want?)LOTR (The scenery is beautiful, but turning everything into some sort of contrived melodrama because the script calls for it is ridiculous; this is by no means the best film ever made. It's a flavor of the month that will die out as time goes by and people realize the acting is horrible.)Etc, etc, etc. It seems like it's cool to dislike The Godfather films because it makes you look like some sort of 'rebel.' Trust me, Spock, it doesn't make you look like you're cool; it makes you look very stupid.
So many people have given this film a '1' in voting. How in the fudge? The music was awful, the acting was awful, the direction was awful? I highly doubt it. Anyone with an IQ over 100 would never say this film deserves a 1.My proposal for a new IMDb rating system, based on categories.SCORE: 1-10 [1 = awful   10 = excellent] ___10___ (KEY)
 ---------------------The Godfather:Acting (leading) 10, Brando changed method acting forever and, in this role, plays the most memorable film character to ever grace the screen. His voice only deepens his enigma. Respect this man.Acting (supporting) 10. Coppola got wonderful performances out of his mostly amateur cast.Score: 10. It's at the same time haunting and beautifully done.Direction: 10 easily. This changed American films forever.Script: 10. Written with brilliance, sheer brilliance. The story is brutal, and so is this ambiguous adaptation.Replay value: 10 -- this film never lets go of me, and has my eye from the very start. I could never get bored watching the masterful acting come from every character in the movie.There, and I average it up and get my rating of: 10. ------------------2 Fast 2 Furious:Acting (leading) 4. I've seen worse, but not much worse. Words are repeated so often it feels like a cheap video game.Actor (supporting) 5. Tyrese gives needed comedy, but still needs to watch some good films.Score. 1. Awful, tries too hard to market itself towards an ignorant mainstream teen audience.Direction: 3. Some of the scenes are decently choreographed, that's about it.Script: 1. Totally forgettable. The dialogue is stagnant and brings absolutely nothing profound or new to the table.Replay value: I'd never watch the film again. It brings nothing new to the table and is stupid.Average that up. If someone gives 2 Fast 2 Furious a 10 for ACTING -- they don't deserve the pleasure of being able to relate to the majesty of the best American film ever made; yes, that's right: The Godfather.
If you don't like it the first time -- watch it again and force yourself to not get bored. If you make it through the second time (it's an acquired taste) think about it, think about the profound story it expresses, the emotions it throws into scene after scene after scene, inviting us to consider, and even feel, the pain they are all going through, and the love and happiness they often share with their, you guessed it, family.Don't like this movie? I'll make YOU an offer you can't refuse: a hip trendy blow-em-up-shoot-em-up flick with no moral value and no merit at its core.
Score: perfect all down the board, this film could never be topped. To me, the only films that come close are Apocalypse Now and Rashomon (in the woods - Akira Kurosawa)But, before you trash this film -- do what I did: give it an honest chance and forget the hype. After a while you will realize the hype was there for a reason, this film is amazing and will continue to be looked at as the best film to ever be made, regardless of what anyone has to say about it. Say it's dumb, say it's long and boring, yeah yeah yeah, you've got ADD, go watch commercials. They're easy to understand and yet so informative. If anyone actually thinks this movie deserves more than a 6 in rating it is disturbed. No professional film goer (someone who has seen over 100,000 films) would EVER say this movie was horrible. Goodfellas is just a mundane rehash of everything The Godfather had already perfectly portrayed. It's a good film in its own right, but could never match The Godfather. Sure, it's hip -- let's get some of that so people will invite us to the mall so we can check out the latest ORIGINAL clothing that everyone else that's trying to be original is wearing! Oh, a shirt that says ""you laugh because I'm different, I laugh because you're all the same."" What a wonderful paradox; there's a million cliche'd teenagers out there wearing that shirt now, thinking they're original for doing it - but yet it's a mainstream shirt that everyone has. Come on kids, watch some good films."
4477,True,"I watched The Godfather for the first time in the mid-70s, shortly after it came out, and I have watched it occasionally during the following years, along with its sequels, and one thing that has always intrigued is how it has failed to carry me on with it, to have me on the edge of the seat and to evoke in me that ""(sigh) Oh, they are playing¬ÖSo And So!"" feeling when I have found it while surfing channels on TV as it has happened with many other movies, including some minor ones. I never could find why until, as in many other occasions before, I came to read the negative reviews of the film: because (American) mobsters are not interesting people. They are just violent, unsophisticated, predators. So no matter how hard Coppola and his collaborators worked during the years that took to produce the 3 films, how much talent was involved, from the director, the top actors down to the humble extra, no matter how hard they tried to give the Corleone family something of an aristocratic dignity, a sophistication, even an ethics, a basic honesty ¬ó""we are into gambling and prostitution, we wont lower ourselves to sell drugs to kids""--this is not a work of art which will last much longer in time because it stays where it was born, in the dark, tortuous, smelly, bowels of the criminal world. The three TGs are not in any way works that overflow their origins and spread to the entire world, as a true masterpiece does. All along the series the Corleones remain strangers to us, they don't belong in our world, our lives, their plight and their labors are theirs, not ours, and there is no way they will ever be. When Corleone grieves for Sonny we don't cry with him, we only say, ""well, what he expected, that's the way you live and die in his social milieu"". And the same with every other (violent) death in the series. (BTW, the only one that gets my sympathy is Freddo, he is the real tragic here, he didn't have a choice to be there as he was born into a world he was completely unfit to deal with, while being at the same time too weak to leave all that behind and start a new life elsewhere. The only one with whom I may relate in any fashion, a real hostage to fate.) But don't get me wrong, I still consider THE Godfather 1 and 2 cinematographic masterpieces--Godfather III is another story--but in the same way that I consider the pyramid of Keops and the Great Wall of China as masterpieces. I stand in awe in front of them but otherwise they leave me cold, I can't relate in any possible psychological, ethical, emotional way to them and here is the reason why that may be.Let me explain IT by comparison. Don Quixote has been chosen as he greatest work in literature because it perfectly embodies the eternal struggle in the human soul between spiritual yearning and the nagging needs of the flesh, the temptations of earthy pleasures, which is true now as it was a thousand years ago and it will be as along as there as a human being alive. We all may identify with it so this is an enduring work of art, one that belongs to all of us. The same can be said of many other works of art, including Coppola's Apocalypses Now. They all touch something in us, they either remind us of our own frail human condition, our dreams, fears, pains, works or constitute simple metaphors of life itself, like Kafka's The Trial. There we can include movies like the Matrix, that explores the essence of physical reality as opposite to pure imagination, and toys with the scary idea that we may not even be capable of making the difference between both. Or Memento, which shows us in a really scary way how we are prisoners of our brain. That is what makes these two movies so interesting, we can see ourselves, our own reality, fears, anxieties, dreams, mirrored in them. That is not the case in the TGs series. At its very core TGs is not different in any way to, say, Casino--mobsters, doing bad things and getting their comeuppance--the only difference being that Coppola tried¬óunsuccessfully in my opinion¬óto envelope the bad guys here with an undeserved halo of dignity by giving the story the form of a family saga like Bertolluci did with his 1900 masterpiece.Now, there is no arguing that the production is perfect. Technically the entire series deserve a 10/10¬óif there was only that to factor in. Everything from the production values, the direction, the reconstitution of an historic era at a very specific place has been done to perfection. The acting is impeccable down to the most humble extra, so the direction and the camera work. The only missing element being the lighting, which sometimes leaves us practically staring at the dark. But as said, all that is enveloping an empty shell with no transcendental meaning. If you don't agree, just do this experiment: watch the movie again and look around you the luxury in which they live, and think that nothing of this has been obtained with honest, work, but with the proceeds of gambling, prostitution and maybe drugs. Pretty hard to base a parable on the human condition on that context, you got to reckon.In all, entertaining to watch when it is raining outside and nothing worthy on TV. Which means 7/10."
4478,True,"I must say that I did not like Godfather when i saw it for the first time. This may have something to do with the fact that i was 10 years old and loved Arnold Schwarzenegger action movies. I watched it again when i was 17 and i was blown away by the beauty (and tragedy) of the movie.I can understand why everyone does not enjoy Godfather. It is quite slow paced and does not necessarily appeal to a viewer who is used to gangster movies with lot of action in them, movies with 'dramatic' Hollywood soundtrack and movies that have quick 'dramatic' plot twists.First of all, you must remember that this is is not a gangster movie. This is a movie about family. This is movie about responsibilities. So if you are waiting to see Scarface then you are in for a big disappointment.Best part of the movie is the story. Movie tells us tale of the youngest son of the American-Sicilian mafia family. Tale of the son who has decided to live his life by the laws of the united states and not have anything to do with businesses of his family. But through the tragedy that brings the whole family together, son is little by little drawn back to illegal side of family. Finally son becomes what he did not want to be. What he despised. Because of the responsibilities to the family he forgets his ambitions and plans and becomes the Godfather.Coppola has really got the best performance out of the actors in this movie. Every emotion of Michael and other characters is forwarded to viewer. Special mention to the cast of this movie. I have not seen a movie with better casting. Cinematography of the movie may be a little out of date but it still is really really beautiful. Especially beautiful sets in Sicily deserve a mention. Nino Rota's soundtrack supports the drama of the movie in a way that I can hardly think of the soundtrack that does this better.All in all, i love this movie. If you combine first two films, you get the classical story of man changing to what he does not want to be. Classical story about rise and the fall of the man who turns from kind and loving person to ambitious, greedy and paranoid leader who pushes all his loved ones away. Story not too far from another one of the greatest movies of all time. Story not too far from Citizen Kane.And oh yes. I will dance Speak softly love in my wedding next august."
4479,True,"THIS HAS A SPOILER IN IT!!!! DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN IT!!!!!!I just saw this movie a couple of weeks ago, and i loved it. I had heard so much hype about it, and that it was the greatest movie ever, so I was skeptical. I was not disappointed; except when Sonny died, that just ruined my day. He was my favorite. This movie has everything that a good drama needs.Actors: Everyone that had a role of significance, played it to a tee. I never noticed any moments of ""I can't believe he just said that. This is like CSI:Miami."" Characters: This movie got you to root for basically the ""bad guys"". It portrays them in a way that makes you feel that they are just like your family, they just happen to kill people for a living. They were all dynamic and interesting, and you couldn't really just classify them as the good or bad guy. Filming/technicalities: Their lighting was the one thing that I actually noticed about the technical aspect. They always had innocent events out in broad daylight, but when a bad guy came on, or something dark was going on, it was almost always concealed in the shadows. Normally I don't really care about those types of things, but it gave the movie a nice effect."
4480,True,"When Francis Ford Coppola is on, he is absolutely on. The Godfather, in all of its noirish glory, is brilliant in virtually every respect. It's hard to criticize it, so I'll just honor it some more.In The Grapes of Wrath (the novel), Ma Joad asks Tom if being in prison has made him ""mean-mad."" She knew Pretty Boy Floyd's mother, and she recalls how Floyd started out as a nice boy who kept getting hurt time and again, and who eventually became a monstrous killer. Michael Corleone is the epitome of that concept. As soon as Vito says that Michael is not to enter the ""family business,"" you know that he will be damned. The movie is his struggle to overcome every single hurt that comes his way, especially when they involve the ones he loves most. You can watch him lose his soul as the movie progresses, and your heart breaks. Coppola and Pacino make you wonder if you should pity Michael, hate him, love him, admire him, condemn him, worship him. That's the difference between a film that skulks around the bottom of the Top 100 films ever made and a film that is always in the top three."
4481,True,"Let me start by saying that I didn't particularly enjoy the Godfather. I found the film too slow paced, and James Caan was extremely irritable. Vito took FOREVER to recover, and when he did he choked it not long later.Saying that, I respect the film and Coppola on the effort and technical prowess on show. Al Pacino is brilliant, if a little predictable, while Robert Duvall steals the spotlight if you ask me, with a truly masterful performance.The final scene will always be remembered, and for good reason, its artistically genius, but I won'y give it away.This film isn't for everyone, so don't worry if you think you oughta enjoy it just because it's ranked number 1 in the top 250. Just remember that films are always about opinion, and there can never be justifiable official ""Greatest Movie"", so if you don't like it fine, don't let other people hound you down just because they insist that it's the perfect film, because as far as I'm concerned, there can never be a perfect film.As Peter Griffin once said, ""It insists upon itself Louis""."
4482,True,"This movie is outstanding for a great number of reasons. Not only is the film aesthetically pleasing but the grandiose storytelling at work is a must see for any film enthusiast.The real success of this film is the much discussed, understated performance from Al Pacino. It is ironic that an actor who is famous in contemporary cinema for his over the top performances in 'Heat'(When I think of a woman's ass..) and 'Devil's Advocate (insert any line here) delivered one of the finest understated performances in cinema history. Another actor could have over played the part and rotted what has to be seen as the films core. Where Pacino is the core, admirable support surrounds him, with brother Sonny (James Caan was never better) and father Don Vito (Marlon Brando) played lovingly and sympathetically. Brando excels in his death sequence playing it with real heart and also displaying the frailty of a former 'tough guy'.Although labelled as a masculine film, the film heralds to great supporting performances from Diane Keaton and Talia Shire. The chemistry between Diane Keaton and Al Pacino in the opening wedding scene is a rare thing and the Documentary featured on the DVD allows us to see more of this. Any couple not gripped by the inner turmoil of the male/female relationships in this film must have hearts made of stone.Finally, my favourite aspect of the film is the work of Walter Murch. This is evident in the caf√© sequence where Murch added the sound of the train to the soundtrack. Cinema has never been so tense.The only way that anyone can realise the true power of what is the finest single achievement in cinema is by watching it themselves. And remember without the first film, the second would never have existed."
4483,True,"This is a legendary movie that I watch over and over again is not boring. The movie content and the actors are all perfect, standard to every detail. Hopefully after a few years we can see a remake"
4484,True,"I love this movie. The continuation is also excellent. Michael was a good successor to the Corleone family, but one of his biggest problems was at home: Kay. If Apollonia was alive to the end, it would be different."
4485,True,"Lovely work All team and supporting artists.
God bless you all team and production House members."
4486,True,"Along with American society in the 1940s, the process of Italian immigrants accumulating illegal property is being portrayed with realistic firefighting, mafia who thinks of families first, and trumpet music.The reason why I chose this film as a top-of-the-line film without hesitation is that story, actors, and music are so perfectly matched. If you are watching this movie, you will soon become immersed in the movie. After seeing this movie, I can not get out of something dark and gloomy.It seems that the process of accumulating wealth beyond poverty in any country has been fierce.The first one was good and the second and third were also great.The Godfather, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, has created the best memories of my life. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino ...PS: Thanks for reading. Please understand that my English is not good."
4487,True,"Best of the trilogy ƒ±s this. I believe that Nino Rota's influence on this movie can not be denied since the main theme is actually amazing. They say for the song Godfather actually named as speak softly love. The theme is amazing just as good as its name. Additionally, al capone is the emphasizing character and I believe it was one of the most prominent character in the movie."
4488,True,"This must rank as the best film. John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza)give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano was Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role. All Actors bring their A-game to this piece of Art thus making believe of the film world to pass as reality. Great performances make the film memorable and trust me you can be addicted to watching it over and over.Watch it."
4489,True,"Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie Welland. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.Nolan has made his ""I will always be remembered"" movie, this is the crown jewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect."
4490,True,"I read the paperback book, ""The Godfather"", when I just became a teenager. The book and the movie are rare for both being excellent, which is why both received high awards.I found the book riveting and I couldn't put it down. But being an innocent young teenager I was horrified by the violence that men can do to men. The character of Luca Brazzi was terrifying, even though it was just fiction. Even the actor who played him, a former, 6'6"" wrestler, was perfect for depicting the quiet, smoldering malevolence as a family 'company' man who took care of the family's enemies in frightening, brutal ways. It was no literary surprise when the Brazzi character met his own brutal karma end.It's easier to gain an assessment of Don Corleone's three sons, Sonny, Fredo, and Michael watching the movie while the book does go into better detail.In the book/movie, Michael, the reluctant son, proves the most capable in the intelligence, cunning, and amorality of his father as his two older brothers fall by the wayside. Yet the whole tragedy is that Michael wanted to be a good man of ethics and morals and would have been a very decent man in a normal family. Fredo, the middle brother was also born in the wrong family. Portrayed as the weak brother, Fredo's weakness was that he completely unsuited mentally, psychologically, and emotionally for life in a crime family and to do the kinds of evil and violent things that would be expected of him. Both men, Fredo, and Michael, would have flourished in normal, middle-class to upper middle-class families. It was the eldest son, Sonny (Santino) who possessed the strength, charisma, apparent leadership ability but not the deep intelligence, foresight, perception, self-control or wisdom to lead the Corleone family.For me the tragedy is not so much the violence or the Corleone family but the two younger brothers, Fredo and Michael, both of whom sincerely and strongly desired to be good men. Fredo's inner weakness led him to betrayal and his ultimate end. Michael's love for his father and family led him to sacrifice the life of a good man for that of an evil crime boss who could give the orders to kill enemies without hesitation and emotion and no regrets."
4491,True,This film is the best movie in the world and it is wonderful and beautiful story and absolutely is one of the best act from Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. Every body most see this three films of Godfather. great story with great directing from one of the best director in the world Francis Ford Coppola.
4492,True,"This the greatest film you can ever watch. Starting from the actor .. moving to the team and technical they used that time. It is amazing and unbelievable they did such a beauty.The story is moving smoothly, the body is building the main point continuously. Music also a PLUS point in the film."

4494,True,"This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out.. With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on a lot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day.."
4495,True,"The Godfather' epitomises how violence can be used effectively within a film. The Corleone's are some of the greatest antiheroes to have ever been seen on screen, whilst they are villains, the audience will refuse to accept that fact, Coppola does something simple and audacious, he takes the guilt out of organised crime. A film rife with beautiful cinematography, memorable musical scores and well-paced action and drama. Overall, The Godfather is one of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes that gets everything right; a gangster flick"
4496,True,"Amazing movie worth watching, not just for entertainment, but for life less too. Each scene shines and brings reality to life.Every moment changes and at times you forget that you are watching a movie. I highly command this to anybody who loves acting,history or the mafia it's self too, it teaches to crap side of life, but with every coin you toss there are two sides to it."
4497,True,"This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life I love this movie and all of the GF movies I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly) This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot."
4498,True,"What a Wonderful Film ..... Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it. But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it."
4499,True,"This film really hits me right in the core of just how powerful the love and loyalty within families are. Also, the struggle within the power of mafia as well as the price on the drug-selling world. Even in its time, it shown light on these things far more than most films really did. Not to mention, the entire cast was exceptional. I could watch this movie over and over again!"
4500,True,This is quite simply the greatest film of all time. The greatest story of all time. By far the greatest cast of all time. It also contains the most iconic and memorable performance of all time by the greatest actor of all time. The greatest introductory monologue of all time. The greatest crime film of all time. SPOILER: The greatest horse-related scene of all time.
4501,True,"Great Movie I loved it Me and my wife saw 3 time when my kid watch it they love it I bought the whole collection to my dad he love the color of the film n the 35 years he spent as TIME's resident expert on all things Hollywood, Richard Corliss, who died Thursday at 71, reviewed more than 1,000 movies. He offered insight into a generation's great works of cinematic art, he applauded real emotion on screen and he wasn't afraid to speak up when he disagreed with the crowd. (His Titanic pan remains legendary, but he stood by his opinion.) He helped us decide how to spend our Friday nights. He encouraged us to look deeper or to look again. Above all, he reminded us why we love the movies."
4502,True,Mighty Mo don't listen to them to answer your question no this is not better than godfather 2 by any stretch of the imagination to most godfather 1 fans and this film takes place in my heart which takes place before the second godfather wan I watch it I always want to reply the first history to understand what happened exactly but there you goÔªø
4503,True,"My favorite film of all time, and the true ''Godfather'' of the gangster film genre. This film has it all; memorable characters and scenes, terrific acting all round (James Caan as Sonny Corleone and Al Pacino as Michael are among st the best acting performances I've seen) and a wonderful and gripping story line. And it's all beautifully filmed; the dark and smoky interiors of the Corleone's retreat (complete with Godfather sitting in the corner in his armchair, face shadowed), the family wedding, Michael's exile in Sicilly and of course the tense scenes at the hospital, and the famous restaurant scene, where Michael turns killer for the first time. Totally memorable, and no other film I've seen is quite as perfect, polished or stylish as the Godfather"
4504,True,"This film represents a complete and perfect mafia life. Of course, this film has a great impact on the lives of the audience. We also see that a brutal mafia can be a good father and a loyal wife. In this film nothing is far from reality and everything is realistic.Corleone's character represents a powerful, serious, and reliable man."
4505,True,"Boi, settle in, i respect people's opinion when they say the godfather is overrated but how can you hate a movie that is so well made on all level the acting is above superb everyone does a great job especially the leading men Marlon Brando is spot on with body language voice and general acting, Al Pacino seems bad at first but once he does the shooting scene it goes uphill like very uphill the shooting scene is his best where his eyes tell the whole story its like he is Micheal Corleone at that moment Robert Duvall does great load acting along with James Caan and a lot of the other male characters. The directing is so spot on in my opinion the second best directed film Coppola strives for such realism you can see it in the scene with the dead horse the actor wasn't aware that there would be a dead head in his bed and the head is real from a real horse so is scream is so authentic. The opening scene and ending scenes has so much detail and symbolism that I can't even go into details. The pacing is f.....g amazing you never get bored even thou it's 3 hours long when ever you are close they hit you with a scene that just blow up and you are fully hooked again. The script is amazing a great story and so many quotable lines the story has so many twist and turn and the characters always feel real the dialogue is spot on delivering so much suspense and information so effectively. The Score it's probably the best score of all times I have never heard a score that fits the movie so perfectly and could also work effectively as normal music it delivers so much suspense and, the best pieces are the godfather waltz (the start) and the baptism these pieces deliver suspense information are are just great I sometimes start hearing these pieces in my head because they are so good. The cinematography is also some of the best of its kind the lighting conveys so much information and every scene is framed perfectly every scene could be a painting. And that is just some of the reasons why the godfather is one of the best film of all time and not overrated (I still respect your opinions)."
4506,True,"This movie is one of the greatest is old but Gold that's why i love it in this movie you learn a lot for the world , family , friends and dirty biz This movie is one of the greatest is old but Gold that's why i love it in this movie you learn a lot for the world , family , friends and dirty biz This movie is one of the greatest is old but Gold that's why i love it in this movie you learn a lot for the world , family , friends and dirty biz This movie is one of the greatest is old but Gold that's why i love it in this movie you learn a lot for the world , family , friends and dirty biz"
4507,True,A masterpiece must watch one of the best movies i V ever seen awesome movie believe or not but this movie is the best I'm serious you really need to watch it i mean if you like mafia movies this movie is the best i think this is the best movie ever I've ever watch this is a legendary masterpiece that you really need to watch I'm sure this movie is the best movie ever
4508,True,"I'm not going to get into everything about the movie and give away spoilers. Instead i am just going to tell you that this movie is a masterpiece and a very realistic portrayal of the Italian Mafia and the crime underworld. And one of the best things to know about this movie, and the rise of Michael Corleone, is that The Godfather 2 is even better and shows the rise of Don Vito and The Corleone Family and at the same time it shows Michael becoming more powerful and expanding The Family to Las Vegas. The movie is like a prequel/sequel combination. I kind of went into part 2 a little more than i should of. To put it to an end, The Godfather is not only one of the best Mob movies ever made, it is one of the best of any kind of movie ever made. If i had to give a list of the top 5 movies ever, The Godfather 1 and 2 would be in that list, no doubt about it."
4509,True,"The best movie in my view made in the 20th century, especially love the Don's line: ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse"". The actors, script, set design, costumes are all top notch and well worthy of the recognition provided by awarding of the Best Picture Oscar for 1972. MUST SEE."
4510,True,This film will and forever will be a masterpiece. The Godfather is filmmaking at its best and ahead of its time. This film broke the boundaries when it came to basic lighting and cinematography because it was one of the first films to not light their highest paying actor up to par. It is one of the greatest crime mob stories ever told.
4511,True,"First there was John Cassavetes, then Francis Ford Coppola. Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, THE GODFATHER is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. There is something deeply resonant in the film's treatment of filial piety, the need for respect, and Western culture's abiding interest in the parallel moral universe of the Mafia. Particularly when trying to understand how the establishment and the corporations that form operate today, having drawn so many lessons from the modus-operandi of mafias and narco-trafficking cartels around the globe. The CEO's of Barclays and HSBC as the latest incarnations of what Marlon represents in the title role of this film: an all-consuming, naked ambition of power, who are always more than ready and eager to splash vast quantities of other people's blood in the pursuit of profit, while hiding behind minions to do it.This film continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 30 years after its release. Nino Rota's score, Gordon Willis' chiaroscuros, the sumptuous set design, and Brando's raspy pseudo-whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory.The film possesses an operatic quality, yet it's more understated than it is flamboyant. It takes its subjects seriously, bestowing legitimacy upon the internecine power struggles of the Mafia normally reserved for classical themes in high art. The film's release initiated a period when American filmmakers dared to take themselves and their artistic ambitions seriously, like the French New Wave and Free Cinema in the UK had done before them."
4512,True,"This film presents a look at the mafia lifestyle in a brutal and violent display. This film has many scenes with very tense and emotional moments. Such as when Michael is at the restaurant with Sollozzo and the commissioner. The moment is very tense, there is no music. The sounds of a train stopping ramp up in volume right before he shoots Sollozzo and the cop. Leave the gun, take the canoli."
4513,True,"Undoubtedly a cinematographic work, represents each character in an imperious way and the drama of the film is backed by an excellent script. With an exquisite cinematic direction making of the film an almost perfect semiotic and narrative composition. Francis Ford Coppola tells us the importance and honor of the Corleone family and its consequences of betrayal in business. The family, business, advice and decisions are the saucer that offers us this great film that despite the years that have passed continues and will remain a classic cult film, recommended in its entirety by filmmakers of all genres."
4514,True,"The Godfather - best cast, best screenplay,best director, best music, so Best movie.When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen."
4515,True,Its a classic for everyone.It's like a wine and never wear off.Day by day its getting change and every time you see this movie you look another perspective to life .In our life everythink get away from taste bu this movie always fresh and it doesn't lose anything.In my conculation teach us a lot of thing for Italian tradition and it will keep teach next generation too.
4516,True,"I saw this film when I was a fresh graduate from college and I literally jaw drop at the epic presentation and epic storytelling in this non linear film. The acting is beyond refined and exceptional I could not fathom up to this day how they got that so natural and so out of this world actions immortalized to the screens by these outstanding actors and actresses of our generation. The director itself is not only a genius and clever one but a perfectionist that presents a movie with almost no single flaw creating a visually impacting, aesthetically appealing, technical excellence, epic storytelling, outstanding acting and exceptional film. What can I say more?"
4517,True,"The Godfather is by far one the best films I have I ever seen. It is my favorite movie ever because of various reasons. The cinematography is exceptional. The dark atmosphere provides the viewer with a visual representation of the shadiness of the Corleone family. The directing and editing are beautiful, with scenes like the baptism killings and Michael's killing of Sollozzo and McCluskey showcasing this. The acting performances are fantastic, some of the best I have ever seen. Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone left a mark on me after seeing it. Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Vigoda, and Castellano all portray their characters perfectly. There is not much else that can be said about how fantastic this movie is. It might be the greatest American film in history. If you have not seen The Godfather, watch it now. You are missing out."
4518,True,"The Godfather is 170 minutes of excruciating realism in the virtually intoxicating world of Italian Mafia - every detail is picked upon, every emotion is explored with fine resolution - it is a masterpiece.Francis Ford Coppola cleverly insinuates an inherent evil in all his characters, weaving a sense of fear in the audience through every frame as he skilfully employs his overwhelming background score to amplify the significance of every transition. Marlon Brando is impeccable in his intimidating yet layered performance as the Don, but it is truly Al Pacino who heightens the picture as the viewer feasts on his electrifying rise from an innocent, patriotic soldier, to the head of the Corleone family.There are numerous thrilling set pieces throughout the film that resonate profoundly towards the audience through their eminent grandeur, such as the Baptism killings, the Sollozzo assassination and the brutal murder of Sonny. However, amongst these iconic scenes of visceral brilliance are the character arcs that truly touch the viewer, including Michael's subtle romance when taking refuge in Sicily, as the audience indulges in the glorious beauty of Italian culture, or even the domestic predicaments that Connie has to painfully bear, which the audience takes to heart.Ultimately, it is the homely, yet threatening physiognomy of The Godfather which makes it the perfect gangster film, one which should never be missed."
4519,True,"From Brando to Pacino, this movie exudes class, Pacino a relatively unknown actor, who grows from a reluctant mafioso outsider, to boss. The story that grows is simply one of the best that converts to cinema, the scenery, the era, the cast, all contribute to a stunning three part drama. Personally, Brando gives a master class in timing, delivery, to the extent we can all see, he is the boss, in this star studded film. I will leave you with this advice, please , watch it a few times, there are pieces of the film you will miss, it's only after reviewing it a few times will you pick up on the nuances that make this epic a stand out."
4520,True,"it is a good movie.http://khanmp3.science.One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing 'The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story."
4521,True,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***Honestly, I don't know a single respectable person who doesn't like this film. It is perfect from every angle and is enormously culturally significant.From the start when we are introduced to Don Vito, to the end where we see the conflicted Michael take control of the dark empire of his father, every scene is captured masterfully. With such a great cast including Al Pacino, James Caan, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, with the ever masterful direction of Francis Ford Coppola, it is difficult to see this film ever failing.Not only performance and direction-wise, it follows the book very well, too. Sure, some subplots are deleted, but with an already immense running time of 3 hours, backgrounds of minor characters like Al Neri and Rocco Lampone will be missed, but accepted as non existent.Overall, this film is perfect."
4522,True,"Great movie to watch over and over again! epic tale of a 1940s New York Mafia family and their struggle to protect their empire from rival families as the leadership switches from the father to his youngest son. The Godfather is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathise with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove. During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organised crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt. The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): Don't ever take sides against the family."
4523,True,"The Godfather set the tone for generations of film after it; through directing, acting, the power of music, and the power of culture. Francis Ford Coppola masterfully creates a small world within America, where the Italian culture permeates and adapts to the world around it. Brought to life by giants like Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall, and juxtapositioned against an alienated Al Pacino, who evolves his character to a point where he finally shoulders and carries the film. The music is so wonderful to the time the film is set in, and is a character in and of itself, marking distinct scenes into immortality. The Godfather is a film built out of perfection, and easily stands the test of time."
4524,True,"Very good movie ! I saw this several times and I enjoyed with my family. I think it's a best choice for someone who wants to build his future in a good way. It's good to know that this film is for adults , because they think different and it could be constructive for themselves. It's an interesting film about life and her principles, about what happens when somebody makes a bad choice or a good one. I think that this movie make us take a risk and make our life more beautiful and easier in a safe way! Special movie! Very good movie ! I saw this several times and I enjoyed with my family.

4525,True,"In ""The Godfather,"" we have the New York-New Jersey world, ruled by five ""families,"" one of them headed by Brando. This is a world where emotional ties are strong, loyalties are somewhat more flexible at times, and tempers are short.In makeup and physical movement instantly evocative of Orson Welles as Charles Foster Kane in ""Citizen Kane,"" Brando does an admirable job as the lord of his domain. He is not on screen for much of the film, though his presence hovers over all of it.It is Pacino, last seen (by too few) in ""Panic In Needle Park,"" who makes the smash impression here. Initially seen as the son whom Brando wanted to go more or less straight (while son James Caan was to become part of the organization), Pacino matures under the trauma of an assassination attempt on Brando, his own double-murder revenge for that on corrupt cop Sterling Hayden and rival gangster Al Lettieri, the counter-vengeance murder of his Sicilian bride, and a series of other personnel readjustments which at fade out find him king of his own mob.In a lengthy novel filled with many characters interacting over a period of time, readers may digest the passing parade in convenient sittings. But in a film, the audience is forced to get it all at one time. Thus it is incumbent on filmmakers to isolate, heighten and emphasize for clarity the handful of key characters; some of that has been done here, and some of it hasn't. The biggest achievement here is the establishment of mood and time.Among the notable performances are Robert Duvall as Hagen, the non- Italian number-two man finally stripped of authority after long years of service; Richard Castellano as a loyal follower; John Marley as a Hollywood film mogul pressured into giving a comeback film role in a war film to Al Martino, an aging teenage idol; Richard Conte as one of Brando's malevolent rivals; Diane Keaton as Pacino's early sweetheart, later second wife; Abe Vigoda as an eventual traitor to Pacino; Talia Shire as Brando's daughter, married to a weak and traitorous husband Gianni Russo; John Cazale, another son who moved to Las Vegas when that area attracted the mob, including Alex Rocco as another recognizable character; Morgana King as Brando's wife; and Lenny Montana as a mobster.Nino Rota's fine score, plus several familiar pop tunes of the period, further enhance the mood, and all the numerous technical production credits are excellent. So, at the bottom line, the film has a lot of terrific mood, one great performance by Pacino, an excellent character segue by Brando, and a strong supporting cast. That will be enough for some, only half the job for others.Murf."
4526,True,"(I'm Dutch, sorry for my bad English)Okay, The Godfather is number 2 on the top 250, so I'm supposed to like it. But I didn't. I want everyone who liked this movie to like it, and please do not care about bad reviews.There are three reasons why I didn't like The Godfather. At first, there were many characters, and it was not clear for me every moment if someone was good or bad. Because I couldn't recognize all characters by their name, I didn't understand all the dialogue about other people in the movie. So any time they were just talking, looked boring to me.Secondly, there was a moment in the movie where a man and a woman where fighting at home. Maybe it's just personal, but I really hate family-fights at home, where one of the fighters is much stronger than the other. At last, the movie is almost three hours long, and if you don't like the movie, that is much too long. I don't say I hate long movies, because I loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Schindlers List and King Kong.There were also very good moments in this movie. The scene with Don Vito Corleone in the hospital when Michael Corleone visits him was quite thrilling, and the scene where (major spoiler ahead) Michael Corleone shots two people in a restaurant was also very good.I think I should just watch this movie again, when I have time for it. Maybe the second time I like it, because I understand more."
4527,True,"Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well- made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint."
4528,True,"The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. The assassination scene is one of the best scenes ever made and you don't forget it. Its not a movie about criminal life or just mafia wars its a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable.Its a perfect movie The music, the acting, everything. The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie. John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role. fabulous acting, superb story and played with characters Do not miss this film!"
4529,True,"The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence. The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis."
4530,True,"The Godfather was one of the great films that I still failed to watch, so lately I took the advantage and gave it a try. There is so much written and said about this movie already that you should probably go far more into the film to really get all the points that make this title as lasting as it has proved to be. But I'll try to sum up what went through my mind as a viewer without further knowledge of the background and making of The Godfather.First I have to say that I am not at all a huge fan of mafia films. Not that there weren't multiple good ones but the topic in general doesn't really catch me most of the time. What makes this one special is that it achieves to make plausible why people act the way they do. It doesn't glorify the mafia or paint a pittoresque picture of it, rather it shows how tired the business can make people and how even they hope for a better future for their children.You can really relate to how exhausting it has to be to be in danger all of the time, not knowing whom to trust or what to expect. Even though I'm quite sure not all the mafiosi were perfect gentlemen like described in the movie and cared first and foremost for the safety of children and innocents.The running time is indeed quite long, but since it could be characterized somehow as kind of a saga, you don't really start to feel bored. To be totally honest, even though some parts could be also told shorter, it didn't bother me at all.What prevents me from giving it a full 10 stars are mainly two aspects. First the characters, or at least some of them appear a bit stiff. Hoe Michael turns from a ""regular"" member of the family to someone that is left with one facial expression only is somehow not really believable. Which leads secondly to some plot points that I think are a bit under-explained. When Michael's wife gets killed in Italy and he returns just to tell Kay he loves her, that development just seems a bit out of the blue to me.But never mind, you see how much work and effort was put into this movie and no-one should regret seeing it. I don't think it is a must-see because after all it's message for me is not that powerful but if you are looking for a well made movie then you should definitely lay back and give it a go."
4531,True,"it is a great movie.. it is wow... i can not describe it... i am going to watch it again fifth time. he Puzo novel is brought to the screen in the definitive tale of the Mafia. A towering achievement for Coppola, who was only 32 when this film was released. Brando is ideally cast in the title role, but his is basically a supporting role. This is the story of Michael, and Pacino is excellent in conveying the transformation of the character from a geeky soldier to a tough mob boss. Caan, Duvall, and Castellano head the terrific supporting cast. Despite the nearly three-hour running time, it does not drag for a minute. The cinematography perfectly evokes the period. Rota's score is one of the most memorable in film history."
4532,True,"This film is excellent on terms of everything present in a beautiful film.Characterization,Narrative,Direction and Acting everything in this movie is perfect.It has aged pretty well as it has been 44 years since it's release and people still discuss about it. They quote lines from it.It is not just a gangster movie.It's about family,loyalty,betrayal,power and so much more.This film has a story which will seem relevant even after 100 years. Michael's transformation into Don Corleone is probably the best film about rise to power ever put on camera.Above all the movie is served by some powerhouse performances : Al Pacino,Marlon Brando,James Caan and Robert Duvall.Basically this film has all things a classic needs to be a GOAT(greatest of all time)."
4533,True,"May contain spoilers*To review what is in my mind the greatest film of all time could involve many superlatives, mind blowing, genius, astonishing. All of which would be true, but its the components that make up those superlatives that I'd like to write about. I procrastinated watching the Godfather trilogy for about a year. My dad had pushed me to watch the films but for reasons that now seem insignificant I refused. One of the reasons was the length of these films, my OCD wouldn't allow me to only watch the first film, as I had been told by a few people the second film was even better.Another reason was the subject matter, I just didn't think gangster films where my thing, how wrong I was. Several Godfather sessions later and the procrastination of watching them in the first place seems comical.From the first second to the last, The Godfather had me mesmerised (theres one of those superlatives I spoke about) the film completely took me to another world, a believable one too. I was in awe of the big named actors that I'd seen in more recent films but never actually seen the film that they were all known best for. Al Pacino's break through role, Marlon Brando's peak performance, along with Robert Duvall and James Caan. Two actors who i'd grown up watching in various other films and yet I'd neglected the one they surely must be most proud of.I grew up seeing cartoons such as the Simpsons reference the Godfather, never knowing what the references where. Famous scenes such as the horses head in the bed and Marlon Brando stroking his cat as he talks of respect. All things I'd seen homaged and yet there I was... a clueless kid.I've seen many Al Pacino and Marlon Brando films, but to have them in the same film, its an honour to watch. Two of the greatest actors of all time and probably two of my top three (along with Robert De Niro who features in the sequel).I could go on forever about the stylisation, cinematography and genius direction from Francis Ford Copolla but the simple truth in my eyes. As a matter of fact the truth in most people's eyes, is that this is the greatest film of all time. A perfect 10/10."
4534,True,"It is always difficult to talk about classic and no doubt ""The Godfather"" is a classic, in fact, one of the greatest of all time. The film has a charm part, which are the details behind the scenes, over all star cast, the author of the script and clear about the director and screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola who is a legend! No doubt the best of the film is the direction, which is an exquisite class! With an absurd Coppola will calm counting frame by frame this story that could have been done in a hurry the basis of chases and shootouts endless. But on the contrary, with few action scenes, the director uses all his talent to focus on very rich scenes with good use of light, sound, photography, performances and spectacular dialogues, all working in harmony and building this history that is intertwined with the dirt permeating the mafia and at the same time love and loyalty that is due to the family."
4535,True,"The best movie of all time. Story, script, scenery, sound, everything. The Godfather is sensational. The actors fits perfectly into their characters, it is a story that delights that captivates the viewers. The nearly 3 hours of movie appear to be few for beauty and motion that the film passes. Will be at the top of the best films of all time by several generations, The Godfather is a classic. Director Francis Ford Coppola has a work which was to be shown only in the best theaters of such grandeur that the film goes on! Francis Ford Coppola, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Abe Vigoda, Diane Keaton, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale ... and all the other characters and involved in the work. Congratulations!"
4536,True,"One of the best trilogy of all time. In my opinion. Story is great and Mario Puzo put this story very realistic. Parables is excellent renovated. Cosutmes are excellent public throughout the film. Nino Rota made great music and left the classic tunes that will be played for centuries. These giants that act in this film made me great fan of 7th art. I simply can not find enough words to describe how much I love this movie, every scene in it. It deserves a place on this list, which is also to say and voices of other people. The film looked at more than 30 times, and every time I have the opportunity to look at it again, whether it's TV or from a private collection, it does not matter. All the best."
4537,True,"Really it is a one of the awesome movie .super like Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.Do not miss this film!"
4538,True,"It is very difficult as a young person to evaluate a movie which is older than I am, but this movie is still very enjoyable despite the poor quality which comes along with 1970s movie making. I expected a lot of this movie because of its reputation, so I was a little bit disappointed but it kept me engaged from start to finish so I was still quite happy after watching it. This movie is so unpredictable it felt like I was behind the plot from the beginning, but I enjoy a movie that makes me think, but that might not satisfy everyone. The development of characters didn't keep the leads separated enough in my mind. In fact, when Sunny and the Don were shot it took me a second before I knew for sure who had been shot. All in all, it is a very good movie that would certainly be improved upon in the modern day, but because of when it was made, it can't be compared to modern films. I think this movie will appeal to most people who enjoy a deep, complex, multi-faceted plot."
4539,True,"Despite being a head of one of the Mafia families in NY and managing it's dirty business that involves racketeering, violence and murder, Vito Corleone is a very respectful and simply human towards others. My favorite scene with Vito sets him in the garden with his grandson, where he dies a happy man. Feels like Marlon Brando lives through all of it, making it true. Could not imagine anyone else doing a better job.His sons, Fredo, Santino and Michael are portrayed brilliantly, showing the diversity of different characters. Santino being warm-blooded and Michael quite the opposite. Caporegimes, always loyal Clemenza and witty Tessio alongside with the story about Connie and her husband brought the depth.I want to give it a 10 out of 10, but there is just something that I was looking for, but did not found.Pros: Perfect casting; Great acting; Very human;Cons: At times too simplistic; Some interesting characters left behind along the way;"
4540,True,"Best movie ever <3 Al Pacino Great Old but gold Seriously Worth watching Dons A great Lesson we learned Never to give up no matter what happens If anyone didn't watched it i will recommend this movie Best 3 hours Love Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business."
4541,True,best movies ever u cant stop watching it i love every part of it the actors was very talented and it make some of them full stars movie after this movie thanks i love i care i watch i do best movies ever u cant stop watching it i love every part of it the actors was very talented and it make some of them full stars movie after this movie best movies ever u cant stop watching it i love every part of it the actors was very talented and it make some of them full stars movie after this movie best movies ever u cant stop watching it i love every part of it the actors was very talented and it make some of them full stars movie after this movie best movies ever u cant stop watching it i love every part of it the actors was very talented and it make some of them full stars movie after this movie best movies ever u cant stop watching it i love every part of it the actors was very talented and it make some of them full stars movie after this movie best movies ever u cant stop watching it i love every part of it the actors was very talented and it make some of them full stars movie after this movie
4542,True,"The Godfather is the best movie ever. No, sorry, is a masterpiece. Great script, great casting, great music, excellent acting and directing. When somebody asks me to explain this movie: ""I... There are no words. Watch it. That's all I can tell you is watch it. Then you will understand why there are no words to how good this is""Ôªø One of the best scenes in all of cinema. The Don gives no loyalty to country or political party. He has no faith in the government or the courts of law. He is fiercely and violently loyal to his family and friends. He abides by a code of ethics. In many ways he has effectively declared himself independent of the government. He looks for no handouts from the government, and he assumes full responsibility for himself, his family, and his friends. This includes the responsibility to wage war if or when necessary. He is ruthless, but not arbitrary. The punishment must fit the crime. He is loyal to his friends, and he expects his friends to be loyal to him. Those who betray are traitors, and traitors are to be put to death. In his own way, he is a dedicated businessman, a politician, a judge, a soldier, a husband, and a father. He provides. He protects. All he asks is for your respect, your loyalty, and your friendship.ÔªøPhenomenal film.R.I.P TessioÔªø"
4543,True,"I don't want to waste time writing a review.Bering, slow, pointless , plot less movie. I don't even remember any dialogues. may be""Dont say you are innocent, it insults my intelligence"" and of of course the famous "":Am going to make an offer which he cannot refuse""Its hard to understand what Marlon Brando is talking. Total waste of time. Main god father, with whom they sold the movie, gets shot, admitted and does not appear for quite a longer time and finally he dies. What a joke!!!Al pacino was sleepy, sluggish, and crying.Slept twice while seeing the movie."
4544,True,This movie totally sucks to infinite and beyond.How the hell is it good? It's total CRAP low budget CRAP actors Al pacino sucks Marlon Brando sucks no violence no gore CRAP story without a doubt the WORST movie I have ever seen! THE best part is the end of this piece of CRAP! Franciss ford coopla should be ASHEMED of himself for this boring.low budget piece of CRAP. HOW? is it number 1. Whats so good about it it's pure S***.It should be number 1 at the worst movie ever made! The ultra cruel Horses head in the bed scene. Al pacino's CRAP acting no guns no violence NO nudity Christ Mario Puzo should be ashamed of of himself for this GARBAGE it's nowhere near as BAD as Goodfella's which was CRAP from beginning to end I HATE Martin Scorese and STUPID Francis ford coopla. They couldn't even make porn look good Stick right away from this RUBBISH!
4545,True,"A movie that apparently needs no introduction. The Godfather - a movie that tops most ""greatest movie of all time, period"" lists, won three Oscars including Best Picture and is #2 on the IMDb top 250. So if there was any indication from all this information it is that this movie is one which has few people raising a word against it. So naturally I wanted to go out and watch this movie and see what the fuss is all about and I didn't like it.The story is that the Corleone family is a mafia family. After the Don (Marlon Brando) is shot in cold blood his reluctant son Michael (Al Pacino) slowly goes back into the family business while his brother (James Caan) runs the family. As time goes on the more the feeling of things being unstable surfaces and James Caan's character is shot and killed. When The Don recovers from his injuries he announces retirement while Michael runs things.Okay onto the positives. This movie's cinematography, editing and directing I have to admit are all very good. I'd say the scene where Michael says his vows to become Godfather of his sister's child while his enemies are being murdered I would say that scene is masterfully done among a few others in this movie.Okay now the stuff people will flip tables at me for, the stuff I didn't like. For a three hour movie I felt very little investment in the story or the characters. The only one I wanted to see make it out okay is Michael and all the rest either have too little screen time or I just never saw reason to connect with them.Okay I hope I have made through reviewing this movie without stepping on too many toes. I mean if someone said they liked this movie I can see why - Some of the technical stuff is almost worth the three hours of my time and I can see some people being more invested in the characters than I was. I'd say check it out, in terms of the technical stuff this movie is worth a glance and maybe you might like the movie more than I did and even then I could see why but for me I just didn't like it."
4546,True,"I personally believe that although the godfather got rave reviews, and is generally thought of as the best movie of all time, I didn't care for it. The truth of the matter is that the epic saga insists upon itself. It was predictable, it was depressing without anything really to be depressed about, and lastly, the dancing elves were really quite over the top, and unnecessary. It was arrogant, pompous, and there was really no plot. It was the worst movie I ever saw. It should have taken a lesson from the movie teenage mutant ninja turtles( which was by the way, the best movie of all time). It was atrocious. Also, what was the deal with the birthday party scene in which Al Pachino gets plastered on moonshine with Barbara Bush, or maybe it was Paula Dean. I can't remember which one; I get the two confused. To even compare this to movies such as The Pink Panther, and The Wiz is atrocious. Both of those movies were brilliant compared to this high budget slouch. Even Marlin Brando's benign performance is not enough to bring this movie up to a two star rating."
4547,True,"Okay, so I've seen this now and I began asking myself, how could this movie possibly end up on 1st place at IMDb and how come everyone loves this movie? I've seen this and, it's horrible. I fell asleep after watching two hours of this. This and Pirates of the Caribbean is the only movies I've fallen asleep to, seriously, and yet it's so unrealistic, like when Don Corleone is out buying fruits he gets shot like eleven times and still survives. You would die after two shots from those types of guns also.Go see Donnie Brasco if you like gangster movies. This is bad, really BAD!"
4548,True,"I don't understand why this movie is on top of the list, i din't find any thing in this movie to top the list with highest ratings. The cast did very good acting though but story not deserve to be on top of best 250. This is one of those rubbish old mafia films This movies always fence around the gangster family about there revenge story sucks, ridiculously overrated in the end all you found that you wasted 3 good hours of your day, its a goddamn crap its annoying. soooooo boring! whatever the reviews and rating says i hate this crap and I won't recommend any one to see this it will only disappoint you from what you expected from ""The Godfather"" Don Out."
4549,True,"Everything that can be said in praise and in analysis of The Godfather has already been said, so I'm just going to write my favorite things about it. One of my favorite scenes is when Vito dances with Connie at her wedding while the main theme is playing. Similarly, I love the scene where Michael and Apollonia are just walking together after they have dinner with her family for the first time down the dusty roads of Corleone Sicily. Few moments in cinema match these in shear beauty and humanity. I tear up every time I watch them. Also, Al Pacino's performance gets better and better each time I watch this film. There are so many layers to it that I just keep finding."
4550,True,"The film is one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment. When, after ruling for two generations, the Mafia's New York Don (Marlon Brando) dies, his youngest son (Al Pacino) takes over reluctantly, but later learns the ruthlessness and brutality required to maintain his position.The Godfather is a brilliantly-made film with all the fascination of a snake pit: a warm-hearted family saga except that the members are thieves and murderers. Its position as one of the great films of the last century is secure, in part because it works on so many levels: as a father-and-son story, as an epic account of the Mob's overt power and clandestine business empires in America; and as an apparently authentic glimpse into a closed world, with its own distinct and deadly codes of behaviour."
4551,True,"Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is an elegant, epic and thrilling work, to a large extent worthy of all its praise.The cast is very impressive and everyone is doing a good job. Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is iconic even though I find his overly coarse voice and stuffed cheeks borderline comical. Perhaps the best thing about The Godfather is that, even though the characters are involved in some questionable activities, they aren't really made out to be bad guys; you keep cheering for the Corleones almost no matter what they do. Some people might use this as criticism but I think it is rather refreshing.Finally, the film is so well crafted in almost every aspect; the sound (particularly in the scene where Michael Corleone kills Sollozzo and McCluskey but also Nino Rota's score, of course), the cinematography (there are some stunning shots) and the aforementioned acting is all top notch. And yet, I think it falls a bit short of a masterpiece even though I have very few complaints. Perhaps it is a bit like with other classic works of art such as Stairway to Heaven and Mona Lisa; The Godfather has been so quoted and praised that it is hard to be completely blown away by it. Nevertheless, it is a solid and unforgettable film that should leave few people disappointed."
4552,True,"I can easily understand why this is considered by many people on EVERY single communication way as the best movie ever made. First of all, I have to say that this isn't a movie for everyone. If you are easily offended by violence then you should think twice before watching it as part of your film culture. I'm not saying it should be avoided because in my opinion; it's the most perfect film ever realized. ""The Godfather"" is perfect on every aspect. The plot is intriguing, very interesting but also very disturbing and cruel at some points. But the movie displays the reality of the horrors that surround mafia and narcotraffic. It also demonstrates the consequences of display of unlimited power, connections, and how leadership is vital for taking important decisions on any level.The Godfather's importance relies on it's influence on modern culture and cinema in general. I could go on and on mentioning the most memorable scenes and not make justice to them. (Taking a breath): The headless horse, Brasi's murder, Vito's demise, Michael assassinating the turk and the captain, ""leave the gun, take the cannolli"", ""Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes"", the FINAL and almost heavenly baptism-massacre parallel situations. ""The Godfather"" is perfect. It paved the way for crime films and believe it or not, I'm sure it generated interest in mafias in the real world.The acting is superb, classic. Marlon Brandon delivers probably the most popular and outstanding performance in cinema. His portrayal as Don Vito Corleone generated a school of acting. Al Pacino plays his part with smoothness and demonstrates his cold blood in the most important family decisions. James Caan is also memorable as the wild, attracted to money son. He is the opposite side of Michael. Robert Duvall is fantastic, he is the most equilibrated character in terms of pace and emotions. Special mention to Lenny Montana for his display as the brutal cold blood bodyguard Luca Brasi and for Abe Vigoda. Also, Peter Clemenza was a key character that could only be acted by Richard Castellano. Diane Keaton was also excellent. The Direction is just amazing. Francis Ford Coppola created a sandbox where crime and politics were generated like a clockwork orange. The visuals are amazing; the Italian exteriors and the American settings make an excellent contrast on every single aspect. When I think of this movie; the first setting (the wedding) comes immediately to my mind. That is because it perfectly describes everything that's going on: negotiations, underground business, and mafia's working for their own benefit. But all these aspects just surround The Don, The Godfather. I'm amazed how all the events are important and relevant in order to deliver the final punchline. I can't praise this movie enough, what I've said, it's been said by millions of persons. But I declare myself as a die hard fan of The Godfather and I believe that ""his"" legacy will last forever.Having power has all kinds of consequences."
4553,True,"Every now and then a film comes along that is something truly special. Within these films everything seems to come together so perfectly, ranging from the acting, to the writing, to the directing. The Godfather is one of those such films.The Godfather is one of the most endlessly entertaining films of all-time. Each and every time you watch the infamous hospital scene you can't help but get tense. When Michael goes to get the gun out of the toilet, your heart quickens. This all a testament to the film's magnificent director, Francis Ford Coppola. This is Coppola's finest work of his career. Though not only is the Godfather an entertaining film, but it is also the thought provoking character study of Michael Corleone, which is just one more reason as to why Coppola deserves recognition. Though Coppola's true merit as a director can be seen in the many magnificent performances within this film. The stellar cast ranging from Al Pacino to James Caan is awesome, though its Marlon Brando's iconic performance as the Godfather himself that steals the show.Overall the Godfather is easily one of the best films of all-time, and while it may not necessarily be my number one, it is awfully close.I give the Godfather a perfect 10 out of 10!"
4554,True,"The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time. Everything about the film is masterful and legendary. The cast is as good as any movie. Marlon Brando (In my opinion, the greatest actor of all time) plays the role of Don Vito perfectly. Al Pacino is amazing as Michael (should have won the Oscar for supporting actor) and the other supporting actors are fantastic. James Caan was the perfect choice for Sonny, Diane Keaton is great as Kay, DuVall acted marvelously as Tom Hagen and Cazalle is great as Fredo. The plot is masterful. There isn't one scene in the movie that doesn't have importance to the plot and there are several memorable quotes. (""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"") Finally, the music by Nina Rota is superb. It fits perfect with the film and is in my opinion one of the greatest movie scores of all time. There isn't one weakness in the entire movie and there is't one single thing I would change about the movie. Finally, the ending is great with Micheal killing the heads of the five families, killing Tessio after finding out he was betraying him and Carlo because he set up the death of Sonny. A true legend."
4555,True,"A few thoughts and observations on an American classic- I doubt 'The Godfather' was shot sequentially (hardly any movies are) but it sure seems to me that the first scene, the wedding scene, was also the first one filmed. The reason I say this is that none of the actors seem completely comfortable with their characters yet; it's as though they're still figuring them out, unlike later in the film, where almost all the actors absolutely inhabit their roles. The same goes for the direction and dialogue, which contains some heavy-handed exposition that is noticeably missing later on too. (Robert Duvall's Tom Hagen tells his wife at one point that he has to go back to work because no Sicilian can refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day. Oh really? His wife never knew this? She's finding out just now, in the middle of the festivities?) As Sonny, James Caan is still working on his swagger, and even Marlon Brando is shown at his desk, holding a cat and stroking it, as though he's auditioning to be the next James Bond villain. (There are no further shots of him holding a cat.) This early awkwardness soon passes but the next scene is just as confounding, in a different way. Hagen is sent to California to convince a Hollywood producer to give a movie role to Johnny Fontaine, Don Corleone's godson. This scene sticks out like a sore thumb now and has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, despite providing 'The Godfather' with one of its most famous images, that of the severed horse-head in the movie producer's bed. No, it's only when Hagen returns to New York that the film really begins. The first several times I saw 'The Godfather,' I had a difficult time breaking it down into segments and sections, as in what happened in relation to other things going on in the film. This of course is the sign of smart scripting and directorial slight-of-hand, and clever pacing which keeps you guessing. For instance, the different scenes where Luca Brazi is killed, then Don Corleone is shot, Tom Hagen is briefly kidnapped by Sallozzo, and Michael Corleone finds out what has happened. These all seem to happen at roughly the same time, but Michael finds out from a newspaper! Yet one never questions it while watching. There are so many great and famous scenes, it's hard to pick favorites, but I notice now when I watch it, I particularly enjoy the one where Don Corleone and his inner circle meet with Sallozzo, just before the aforementioned violence. It's one of the few times in the lengthy film where we actually get to see the Don at work guiding his empire and making decisions. Not a great deal happens in the scene, but it's a good example of Don Corleone's thinking and helps explain why he is held in such high regard, why he is in fact the 'irreplaceable man', as will soon become apparent. Sonny is obviously to be his successor, and just as obviously lacks the old man's reasoning and negotiating skills. Fredo is just another body in the room and Michael isn't yet ""with"" them. Despite the incredible wealth and influence we've seen the Corleone family possess, this scene and its immediate aftermath show just how fragile and tenuous its grip on power is in dangerous circumstances. The relative ease with which the Don is set up and shot, as well as the quick dispensing of his main hit-man, Luca Brazi (who had been portrayed as almost invincible), proves that Sallozzo was correct, in the short term anyway: get rid of the Don and his empire collapses into confusion. The rest of the film is more or less the laying out of a careful and methodical revenge plotted by both Michael and the old Don, following a major subplot having to do with Michael hiding out in Sicily after killing Sallozzo and a New York police captain. It all leads to perhaps the most famous scene of all in 'The Godfather,' the baptism sequence where everyone who plotted against the Corleones get their comeuppance, from Connie's husband Carlo to the rival Mafia chieftains who hoped to exploit the Corleone family's momentary weakness. That it feels like justice being served says something about how Coppola has successfully manipulated the audience into rooting for the Corleones. The word 'adventure' doesn't usually come to mind when discussing 'The Godfather,' but that's what it is, an astonishing adventure for the characters and an eye-opening look inside a powerful crime family for the audience."
4556,True,"This is my personal favorite movie of all time. It's just perfect. I actually hate to give it 10 stars (because there's no such thing as perfect), but I haven't a choice. It's just perfect. If you hate this movie...well, then, that's fine. This is the greatest movie I've ever seen. The settings are amazing, as are the camera angles, and the acting has no spots. The only thing imperfect about this movie is the character Santino. I just hate him. I'm glad he died. Critic's Star Amount: 4 (out of 4) Stars My Rating: 4 (out of 4) Stars You should watch it. It's just perfect. THere are few movies that can even compare to this. I just suggest this...if you only like the film because of the bloody scenes, then you should watch Pulp Fiction."
4557,True,"I am an avid gangster film collector. The Godfather is my favorite movie. I watch all three every six months. My mother introduced me to this when I was a teenager in the 80s and I was hooked. Paccino is my favorite actor and I think up until the mid 90s he was the best character actor who ever lived in his error. Mario Puzzo did a great rendition of the book although when you read the book there are some differences as there always is. Mike was that ruthless cunning boss who would not let anything go, even if it was his own brother! You can't help but wonder if his character was based on Carlo Gambino who was also cunning in how he worked his family."
4558,True,"Ladies and gentlemen, I happen to think that this is a major milestone in my film review career. This is my 500th review on IMDb. I feel proud, I feel excited and yet now I have 1000 in my eyes and shooting for the stars. Thank you to everyone who reads and enjoys my reviews because I love watching the movies...even the bad ones...but I am excited about 2007's Summer films coming out. Live Free or Die Hard is one of my most anticipated!! To choose the film that I would bestow my 500th review on was actually very simple. I knew it had to be a classic, something perhaps controversial and to me The Godfather was the obvious choice. To some The Godfather is considered the finest film ever made...period. It might be the mostly widely accepted classic in cinema history and there is good reason behind it. The Godfather is also currently the highest rated film on IMDb (currently getting an outstanding 9.8 average.) So let's talk about The Godfather.For me The Godfather is true brilliance...I won't argue with it and I came into this review determined to nit pick this classic and try to find something slightly off with it. I couldn't do it...I couldn't find a single reason why I wouldn't slap a 10/10 on this...so I did. The Godfather is far more than a 'gangster flick,' it's far beyond Goodfellas, Casino, or The Sopranos because The Godfather is a drama, a deep intense, disturbing, dark drama that draws you into this political, violent, gritty world that this family lives and breaths and has for years. You see a man who grew up in this lifestyle under the most powerful man in the underworld and yet chose to turn away from it but is almost destined to be pulled back towards it and take control of the powerful family. Every scene in The Godfather is done with the utmost care and respect, the characters are so intensely created from the smallest roles, to the biggest and you feel like you're right there. From the streets of New York, to the countryside of Sicily, from brutal murders and assassinations, to marriages, funerals, and births. The Godfather is quite simply an astounding piece of epic cinema.Marlon Brando because he is Hollywood Elite certainly gets top billing for the film. I admit I have only seen Brando in a handful of films and The Godfather is the earliest work of his I have seen so I have not seen Brando in his 'classic' Hollywood roles. I just don't think Brando should have gotten top billing, that being said Marlon Brand IS The Godfather. The only problem is that throughout the film he is aged, delicate and sickly so that we don't see him in what would have been his prime and yet with every movement and word that Brando does you can envision Vito Corleone as the powerful figure he once was. Brando IS The Godfather...period. Al Pacino is the true star of this film. He brilliant creates the son of Vito Corleone Michael. As a character Michael goes through more diverse changes than anyone else. In the beginning he is a returning war hero, desperate to keep his distance from his family name and family business and yet by the end he IS The Godfather...Don Corleone and single handedly has saved his families future. Pacino is downright brilliant and I love his work but this is one of his truly best performances. Pacino was absolutely robbed by not receiving a nomination or win for this performance when Brando got both and didn't even accept it. Pacino turns in a better and more depthy performance by far. James Caan is also brilliant as the hot headed and easily angered Santino Corleone who is forced into the position of heading the family when his father is almost assassination. Caan doesn't get as much screen time as his character deserved but nonetheless makes 'Sonny' one of the most memorable characters from the film. Robert Duvall turns in probably one of the second best performances in the film as soft spoken, legally minded and intelligent Tom Hagen who tries to guide the Corleone family through the worst of times both diplomatically and strategically. He never dirties his own hands but is always willing to do what necessary to protect the family. Duvall is brilliant as well. This main cast is supported by a brilliant supporting cast including Richard S. Castellano, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, John Cazale, Al Martino, and Lenny Montana (all of these actors stand out from the enormous cast as important and well played characters.) As you watch the film you might even think it's dragging a little and thinking it's a little slow but then you're so incredibly caught up in every moment and every story of this family that you're completely enthralled. Their are more brilliant and shocking scenes than almost any other film in history including...Michael's first wife's death, the horse head in the bed, the Assassination Michael performs in the Restaurant and the downright poetically disturbing murder of all the five family heads at the end. Director Francis Ford Coppola set himself apart permanently in the history of cinema by making this beautiful, gritty and quietly violent film. Mario Puzo wrote characters that have so much depth and importance and such real emotion to them. It might take awhile to get through The Godfather but every minute is worth it because this film lives up to it's powerful name and is truly worth the title of classic. 10/10Keep reading my reviews and see you at 1000!!!

4559,True,"It has been over three decades since its birth, yet *The Godfather* reigns as the yardstick by which all other gangster movies are brutally scrutinized.Only twice has its proprietary mien been challenged - with Scorcese's gutshock *Goodfellas* in 1990 and David Chase's superlative *The Sopranos* in 1999. Everything else runs a far, far fourth behind these juggernauts.From Mario Puzo's book of the same name, Francis Ford Coppolla directs the legendary story of an East Coast crime lord, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in the eponymous role), grooming his eldest son, Santino ""Sonny"" (James Caan) to take over the Family Business, that being, one arm of the Italian ""Five Families"" who run the Eastern seaboard's organized crime. When Sonny is brutally gunned down in an inter-familial dispute, Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), who sought a life removed from the Family's ""business,"" ultimately discovers his familial and business instincts and steps into the breach to take the reins.Like the movie itself, its characters have weathered the three decades to become icons by which all other movie gangsters are measured; most of the actors in these staggering roles never quite shaking off the specter of their characters ¬ñ which will surely haunt them far past their own deaths.These archetypes have become so ingrained in our culture that it is almost impossible to think back to a time when they did not exist; like trying to imagine a world before *Smoke On The Water*, or *Star Wars.* Very simply, if not for *The Godfather* these archetypes would not be archetypes. The movie actually influenced real crime families with its new street vernacular (""Make him an offer he can't refuse"") and manner of conducting ""business"" (that of regarding any means to achieve an end as honorable ¬ñ as long as the good of The Family was invoked).The greatest gift *The Godfather* bequeathed the movie-going public was its unapologetic stance on anti-social behavior. Beyond ""Man with No Name"" protocol ¬ñ where a lone stranger would operate by his own rules, disregarding anyone else's well-being for his own ends - here was a FAMILY, an organized para-militia of sociopaths who followed principles wildly at odds with ""normal"" society's. Yet Puzo, Coppolla and actors boldly offer no excuses as to their characters' existence, motives or actions. After our Gangster 101 schooling with James Cagney, Edward G. Robinson and George Raft, here was a blood-driven, wealth-engined world only hinted at in those previous gangster genre movies, now fleshed out almost against our will; here was a world where our societal notions of right and wrong were utterly reversed, yet which made sense in the verisimilitude of its own universe.Searing with grand irony, the first line of dialog in *The Godfather* is, ""I believe in America."" And indeed, these characters are not mindless convenience store hijack artists ¬ñ they are businessmen in the truest sense of the word. They are also imbued with a strong sense of loyalty and justice. Though *The Godfather* may seem apologist in its stance towards supposedly heartless criminals, telling the tale from *their* point of view allows us freedom from guilt when we realize that ""crime"" is a subjective term. As Don Corleone states, when opting not to murder molesters, but rather land them in hospital like their victim, ""We're not murderers."" No matter they dabbled in gambling, prostitution, money-laundering and murder, they sought only to be self-sufficient, to keep their families well, and to live comfortably in peace - otherwise called The American Dream.In setting the tale in the 1940s, Puzo and Coppolla removed us from everyday reality from the outset; in this insular universe we readily accepted The Family's version of morality. It was no stretch to dovetail the authorities' actions in the film with our suspected perception of them in our reality. Matter of fact, it seemed to vindicate our darkest suspicions that the people whom we place our unmitigated trust in for safety from society's savage shadow dwellers are in cahoots with those very shadow dwellers who are trying to subvert our safety.There are scenes that will be burned forever into your mind's movie wall: the opening tableau of the Godfather presiding at his desk; the head of racehorse Khartoum in Jack Woltz's bed; Michael gunning down the police captain; Carlo Rizzo being bitch-whipped by Sonny; the slaying of Sonny; even seemingly-benign scenes like Moe Greene's meeting with Michael, where he claps his hands together and exclaims, ""You goddam guineas really make me laugh!"" ¬ñ the subsequent bullet through his eye is another mind-burner; and the grand ""cleansing"" ¬ñ scenes of the East Coast bosses being killed systematically juxtaposed over Michael renouncing Satan at his god-daughter's baptism¬Ö Through it all runs the unbreakable thread of Family. The opening wedding scene ends on a poignant note of a father dancing with his daughter. Harking back to the familial theme constantly, Coppolla reaffirms our deepest vicarious desires. We are all immigrants to some extent, the bonds of our heritages displaced, fragmented, growing weaker over every generation of X-Box and internet junkies; there seems nothing that can bind the strands of our familial threads. We find affinity in the blood bonds of *The Godfather*, on some level deeper than the span of oceans and the passage of time.(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)"
4560,True,"I found the godfather to be slightly growling and over long, however I am not a gangster movie fan. You cannot put the Godfather down for it's immaculate acting and terrific set design. Marlon Brando was absolutely fantastic and never failed to shock with his brilliant performance. Al Pacino didn't impress as much as I thought he would, however, he carried off the performance with style. The hidden details within the Godfather are subtle yet enthralling. Attention to detail is duly noted and can be seen in many of the scenes, including where Michael makes his first killing. The change in character is subtle yet powerful and you can't help but wonder whether he's doing it because he wants to or because he feels he has to. all in all, The Godfather was a good FILM however I found it slightly dull but may appeal to another audience."
4561,True,"During a normal day in the life, a daughter is getting married, which should be the most proud time for a father. It should be the day when it is all about getting together with the family and enjoy the just married couple... yet Don Corleone has some business to attend to, and during this wedding he offers his help to many people, who needs justice the hard way. Vito Corleone has under-the-table-deals which are just as important to him as protecting his family. The opening scene is about twenty minutes long, where the Godfather setting is established. The raw criminal life of gangsters who must take care of the family as well as the family business. A great bunch of stories are entwined in this movie - stories about family(especially father and son), tradition, criminal life, power, all perfectly combined into one great story about the Godfather. It's well instructed, especially the scene where the Corleones are killing the leaders of the 5 families... it's a robotism, but with the sad church choir music and all the killings going on at the same time, it all seems pretty much like a requiem... Marlon Brando's performance as Vito is outstanding but so is Al Pacino as the son Michael. The movie is filled with great acting which includes Robert Duvall's work as Tom Hagen. The greatness about the Godfather is, that it's a perfectly combined story and very well directing as well! Francis Ford Coppola knows exactly how long a scene should last in order to give all the actors the time they need to show how they master their roles. This is not boring, but on the other hand very exciting as it gives the movie quite an artistic perspective. It goes from being a great movie into being beyond great.. It's a cultural and intelligent masterpiece that takes a lot of patience though but what art doesn't require patience?.... bad art!"
4562,True,"I am not able to discern much greatness here. Very slow to start it takes too much time to set the mood with period sets and as a consequence does not have the time to make us get into the characters, raise our interest for them. For a long time it is not really clear on which of the main characters the movie really focuses and we thus cannot invest ourselves in one of them, but have to watch in a rather detached way the ""epic story"" of an entire family, their general mafia business dealings which to me at least are nothing new. The focus on Michael which comes only after some time is achieved with a scene where as a loving son he saves his father, then with a rather inexplicable revenge act which starts an all out gang war, and finally with a cartoonish love story which is also an exploitation device: the one full frontal nudity shot is totally out of place, and I am not against sex on film in general (the scene is however a direct adoption of Mario Puzo's pulp style, so it's at least true to the original material). All this is hardly above cliche. Compare this to Goodfellas, where Martin Scorsese lets us into the head of one single gangster. By concentrating on three friends and their ascent in the mob, the viewer is guided in an effective and engaging way. The exhilaration, the rewards, the madness, the brutality, the arrogance, the anxiety of the mob life are all presented and, using voice over, explained. The viewer gets to understand the motivation of the characters in depth. That Scorsese is a much more effective director than Coppola can be seen from a direct comparison of two scenes. In The Godfather, Sonny beats up his brother-in-law Carlo when he discovers that Carlo beats his wife. This is done in a somewhat drawn out, brutal but standard style, filmed from a relatively static viewpoint at a distance. The average viewer having witnessed hundreds of movie-brawls is most unimpressed. In Goodfellas, Henry knocks down the guy who was harassing his girlfriend in a very similar scene. However, set in a peaceful neighborhood and done in a much faster editing style, the violence comes as a shock and it's over before it has begun. When Henry concludes the encounter with a death threat and Karen in voice-over talks about how she gets excited by the behavior of her boy friend, Scorsese has created a lasting impression. Or, as another example, compare how food is treated, an obvious fetish for the Italian-Americans as portrayed in movies. Coppola treats us to an recipe explained on-screen by Clemenza and a few shots of dining tables and dishes full of food. Scorsese however continuously gives us close-ups of frying pans and people cooking and amassing foodstuffs, and, in the narration of the last day before Henry is arrested, makes the stirring of the tomato sauce into the calm eye of the storm. This is just a masterful characterization, giving 'flesh' to the topic and guaranteeing to leave everybody hungry. The Godfather does have it's moments, of course, and it has a formidable cast. The problem is that they only have a pulp novel to play with, whereas in Goodfellas it's the true autobiographic material of a real life gangster.
Finally, I want to add that The Godfather is certainly not the ultimate masterpiece for Coppola. From a directorial standpoint he has achieved much much more with Apocalypse Now. In the end, however, Martin Scorsese is still a better director by far."
4563,True,"(WARNING: Plot Spoilers)
If you have not seen the Godfather, do yourself a favour - skip my comments, and rent it today! I have seen this movie too many times to comment without giving away key elements.This movie is a cinematic landmark - one of the great achievements of the 20th century. From its quiet opening in Vito Corleone's office, with the the blubbering appeal of Amerigo Bonasera (""Make them suffer as I have suffered"") to the closing of that same office door at the end, when Kaye comes to grips with the man she married, every frame of this film is filled with intrigue, images and treachery.You cannot view this film and judge its morality - it has none. It told entirely on its own terms. All the main characters are career criminals and the only law enforcement office in the movie is a corrupt cop protecting a drug dealer. To watch the movie, you have to accept its terms. If you do, you will be in for an experience of a lifetime.The wedding scene at the beginning is brilliant. Slowly but surely, all the characters are introduced, while at the same time, we get bits of information on their personalities and foreshadowing of future events. Note some of the payoffs that this scene sets up. That Paulie Gatto is a traitor (""If this was someone else's wedding). That Bonasera the undertaker will owe the Don a service, to hide his son's massacre from his wife. That the plea of Johnny Fontaine for a movie role will result in him reluctantly agreeing to perform at a casino for the family. And of course, there is the introduction of the fearsome Luca Brasi.Marlon Brando makes this movie great. Don Corleone is arguably the most famous and most imitated character in movie history. The accent, the hand gestures, the sly smile he give Solozzo are  all a credit to an acting genius.The score by Fellini composer Nino Rota is one of the creepiest and most famous in film history. It complements the film rather than overpowers it, and gives the Godfather its unique quality. Gordon Willis' cinematography can only be described as perfect.The movie ends with the famous ""baptism scene"" in which Michael renounces Satan while executing all of his enemies - the baptism is the perfect alibi. In this scene, we learn how Michael views himself - a man in perfect control over his own world, above the law of both man and God. Truly fascinating.The Godfather also contains my single favourite line in movie history, spoken by Clemenza after the murder of Paulie Gatto: ""Leave the gun. Take the canoli.""I like Part II even more, because the plot is more involving and the flashback scenes to the rise of Vito Corleone are the best cinematic work ever (imho). Needless to say, these movies are numbers 1 & 2 on my all-time list.For me, this is a perfect motion picture. **** out of ****."
4564,True,"The sequel of this movie is the American masterpiece, not this oneAnd it's so obvious if you watch the sequel and see how much has gone into it and the fact that it still stands up better than the original.Robert De Niro is a much better actor than Brando and proves it in this film. Al Pacino is at the top of his game also in this film, so this all adds up to this being the Godfather of American film making.No competition, Godfather II is the best, the 'Elephant Man' being a close second and 'The Butcher Boy' finishing off my selection.Who else loves 'Elephant Man'?Roll on 'War of the Worlds', big up Spielberg."
4565,True,"So this movie is only number two out of 250 of the greatest movies ever made ¬ñ whatsa-matta wid u? Dis movie should be numba one; along wid ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino."" Yeah ¬ñ dats right, dey all gotta be numba ones; numba twos is for losers. Time to make offers dey can't refuse; clean da horse-heads out a-da bed and load up dat ole John J. Bartek moving van ¬ñ we gotta settle dis ¬ñ once and for all. OK, maybe I am going a little over the top, but before the Corleone family hit the cinemas, there really wasn't much spattering screens that defined what went on behind closed doors in 'The Cosa Nostra'; 'The Mafia'; 'The Family' or whatever these folks are known as. From the time Mario Puzo's pen first bled ink onto an empty pages, who would have guessed a masterpiece was about to be born. By the time Coppola's finishing touches on this creation, there could hardly be any doubt. This cinematographic brilliance known as, 'The Godfather' is a story hard to beat. There are those who say the movie is 'overrated'...to them...I say 'Go Watch ""The Birdman.""' Haters are just going to hate like a bunch of crybaby haters. ""The Godfather's"", writing and script are superb; the acting and cast is outstanding and the saga's story-line is unmatched, what else is needed? I like the pace and depth. No super villains and no super cops...just Mob vs. Mob vs. Mob...I love it. Anyways ¬ñ watch this when you can - or if you haven't already. You are encouraged to come to your own conclusion using sound judgment. And remember...if you don't mark this as numba one you will want to reconsider ¬ñ at least that's if you know what's good for you."
4566,True,"I don't think I can safely call this overrated as I'm seeing it forty years after its release. It definitely stands the test of time, since it appeals to both older crowds that have grown up with it as well as younger movie fans like me that have grown up with a completely different breed of genres and story structure and the like. I don't think you could make a similar movie today that accomplishes being both highly respected and highly successful. Not to say that those two qualities can't go hand in hand, but dramas just don't draw huge crowds as much today. It's too bad, because I'm sure there could be a Godfather for this generation, but it has to compete with all the teen book series movies and superhero movies and an endless stream of smaller comedies that take precedence at the box office.The complexity of the plot is pretty well balanced; it keeps you interested and you'll learn a lot more from your second or third viewing, but you understand the story pretty well the first time you see it. The large number of important characters can get a bit confusing, especially those like Barzini who are not on screen very much but are mentioned a lot and are very important to the plot. The extended runtime allows for lots of development for each character, but the Michael is really the only one with an arc. Characters like Sonny, Kay, Vito, and Tom Hagen have progression but we don't have any real sympathy with them. The family as a whole has an intensified view of what a lot of the American working class sees as right and wrong. Within the family, there are defined boundaries that cannot be overstepped, as seen with Connie and Carlo's relationship. But in the world of the Mafia, there are no such rules and the ends always justify the means. The emphasis on family ties is integrated into the business of the Mafia since family and loyalty is what keeps the business together and keeps it functioning well. This is probably what makes Vito a likable character even though he deals in some dirty business. His work and his family are what are most dear to him, and the nature of his work allows him to work for both simultaneously. Also, he gives respect to those who show virtue, but not to those who just do things out of self-interest as with Bonasera in the opening scene and his refusal to invest in the drug-dealing business. This sort of mentality is not as present with Michael, who is just as ruthless as his father in making ""offers they can't refuse"" and such, but does not hold family trust in as high a regard. Once Vito is gone and Michael has gotten over his aversion to mob life and fully accepted his role as don, he effectively orders Carlo's death, ignores his sister's resulting emotional breakdown, and does not even trust his own wife with the truth of the matter. Perhaps this is the sort of thing that Vito had in mind when he appointed Michael as don; he knew it had to be done, but couldn't do it himself.I wasn't absolutely wowed by any of the actor's performances, but the entire cast gave a great showing. Much of the dialogue is good. Some obviously is spot on, but the rest is pretty low-key. The conversations are well constructed and it definitely improves the flow of the movie, but it's not something that you notice while watching it. The pace can get a bit slow at times, but then picks right back up again with some shocking event. This was something that I thought was really well done. Things were predictable and unpredictable at just the right moments. Vito's shooting, Apollonia's death, the mutilation of the horse in that guy's bed, and the murder of Luca Brasi are all sudden and shocking and come out of nowhere. Then events like the murder of the other four don's, Apollonia's father admitting his relation to her by denying her existence, and Vito's death in the garden are all intentionally very easy to foresee, but they have to be shown to have the full effect. You could just have Michael come home to Vito's dead body, but somehow it's better to see his final moments.If you haven't seen it, it's an interesting watch. It's not terribly confusing, but don't watch it if you aren't into complicated movies. I didn't find it over-hyped, but some people might, so lower your expectations a little. I would suggest watching it in as close to two sittings as possible. One sitting might be too long and cause you to get lost. More than two and you start to forget important plot points. Definitely try to find an environment where you can keep the volume constant so that you can hear the quieter dialogue but don't have to worry about disturbing people during the sudden spurts of violence. On that note, I will warn that there is a fair amount of brutality and blood, some of which might be disturbing and not the type that gets your adrenaline going like modern action movies. So if none of what I've described deters you, definitely give it a shot. Overall Rating:8.8/10."
4567,True,"The Godfather is a 1972 film based on the homonym book Mario Puja. Was director Francis Ford Coppola and starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. The film is considered one of the best films of all time. In March 2010 page Internet Movie Database1 is rated by users with 9.1, extent to which he holds the second place. Since the film also has stay the phrase had said Don ¬´I'm going to make him an offer he can not refuse ¬ª(I'll make an offer that can not be refuse), which was voted as the second most memorable phrase in the history of cinema. Very nice Cast! Thank you! The Godfather is a 1972 film based on the homonym book Mario Puja."
4568,True,"just outstanding the sense or morality even thought what they do is wrong, you get a sense of pride and respect. at the end you do start wanting to create the same level of respect and love with your own family as if it was the same. defiantly deserves the word legendary as it is a timeless classic and should be watched if you haven't already.this movie should be watched closely and with patients to get into as i can come across so the viewers that are not use to this type of pace, storyline can get confusing sometimes if your bad with names, other than that there no issues the film is well known for a reason and allows for multiple deductions to made within it as you try to find out who did what."
4569,True,"the best American films ever made thank you This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic. Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family. The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for ""gangster movies"", but its influence goes well beyond that."
4570,True,"The Godfather is one of that movies that has something ""out of print"". It seduces you from the beginning 'till the end. It has very many pluses from the background atmosphere to the characters construction. Marlon Brando he is obviously one of the best actors of all time. He is the type of actor that was epic for his time and if he could somehow appear in our days he will definitely rule. With only $286 million at box office, the movie was for a time the highest grossing picture ever made, and remains the box office leader for 1972. Others with big contribution has Francis Ford Coppola(director), Mario Puzo(screenwriter), Al Pacino(actor) and Robert Duvall(actor)."
4571,True,"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Godfather it is the best movie ever i saw, its encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through. It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Why this movie didn't win all Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you."
4572,True,"This film follows Vito Corleone the leader of a New York Mafia called 'family' having to deal with the consequences of ether moving with the times and going into drug related crime or sticking to the traditional old country ways of gambling. This effects his war hero son Michael who has no intentions into going into the family business.The Godfather is the best gangster/mobster movie ever made in my opinion. Its simply phenomenal. There's not much I didn't love in this movie a few things that were a bit dated but made the film even more enjoyable to watch. The acting in this film is fantastic by everyone not just the main gangsters like Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) who brings a chilling confidence in everything he dose now its one of the most iconic performances in cinematic history and it shows, its really good to watch. Same goes for Al Pacino as Michael Corleone he was just gripping to watch to see him slowly change from an good guy war hero to a ruthless mafia leader you completely gets you engrossed. Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen was brilliant too, always in the background ready to give helpful advice whenever needed one of my favourites and a really interesting character to watch. Then the less main characters like Talia Shire was amazing in this film she really played her part well. I could go on about each actor in this film but I won't there's just some of the standout performances in this film and I can assure you their are more. The directing still to this day is brilliant to watch its simple but very elegant. The script is for me one of the best written in movie history its got some of the most iconic lines every scripted and to have such talented actors its no wonder this film is so popular. The soundtrack again is so memorable at times it brings chills down your spine with thrill and excitement knowing something truly awesome is about to happen. The only thing I thought was a bit dated was just in one scene when Michaels brother Sonny Corleone played very well by James Caan where he is fighting his sisters husband for beating her and you can clearly see he's miles away from touching him. Like I said tho this just makes this film that bit more fun to watch. Overall this film has some of the best overall acting you are likely to see, some of the most iconic script and music you are likely to hear too. Its a must see for any movie movie watcher, a timeless classic and I hear Part two is even better!"
4573,True,"The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.One of the original ""Movie Brats"" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial super stardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" The almost three hours, R-rated saga film (for violence and graphic language) won three Oscars: Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando refused to accept the award) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola). The other seven nominations included three for Best Supporting Actor (James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Al Pacino), Best Director, Best Sound, Best Film Editing, and Best Costume Design. One of The Godfather's original eleven nominations was removed, Best Music (Original Dramatic Score), when it was determined that Nino Rota's score had been used for a previous film.Gangster films are one of the oldest of film genres (starring Edward G. Robinson, James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart), emerging as an influential force in the early 1930s (e.g., Little Caesar (1930), Public Enemy (1931), and Scarface (1932)). This gangster film re-invented the gangster genre, elevating the classic Hollywood gangster film to a higher level by portraying the gangster figure as a tragic hero. The rich and enthralling film is characterized by superb acting and deep character studies, beautiful photography and choreography, authentic recreation of the period, a bittersweet romantic sub-plot, a rich score by Nino Rota, and superbly-staged portrayals of gangster violence. Its grim, dark passages and bright exterior scenes are all part of the beautiful cinematography by Gordon Willis.The Godfather is an insightful sociological study of violence, power, honor and obligation, corruption, justice and crime in America. Part I of The Godfather Trilogy centers on the Corleone crime ""family"" in the boroughs of New York City in the mid-1940s, dominated at first by aging godfather/patriarch ""Don"" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in a tremendous, award-winning acting portrayal that revived his career). A turn-of-the-century Sicilian immigrant, he is the head of one of the five Italian-American ""families"" that operates a crime syndicate. The 'honorable' crime ""family,"" working outside the system due to exclusion by social prejudice, serves as a metaphor for the way business (the pursuit of the American dream) is conducted in capitalistic, profit-making corporations and governmental circles.This epic story traces the history of their close-knit Mafia family and organization over a ten year period (although the specific words ""Mafia"" and ""Cosa Nostra"" are not found in the film's script - they were replaced with ""the family""). The presiding, dominant Corleone patriarch, who is threatened by the rise of modern criminal activities - the drug trade, is ultimately succeeded by his decent youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), a US Marine Corps officer in WWII who becomes even more ruthless to persist. Family loyalty and blood ties are juxtaposed with brutal and vengeful blood-letting and the inevitable downfall of the family. Romanticized scenes of the domestic home life of members of the family - a family wedding, shopping, a baptism, kitchen cooking, etc., are intertwined with scenes of horrific violence and murder contracts - a total of 23 deaths litter the film. Over 50 scenes involved food and drink."
4574,True,"Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If a film is about Jewish mobsters, it's a ""Jewish Godfather""; if it's about the Chinese underworld, it's an ""Oriental Godfather""; if it takes place in contemporary times, it's a ""modern day Godfather.""If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it.The film opens in the study of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Godfather, who is holding court. It is the wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request on that day."
4575,True,"This movie has everything a masterpiece needs. Excellent writing, compelling characters, and a story worth knowing. It tells of the politics of the Mafia in the 1940s, focusing on the Corleone family. Don Vito Corleone is a smart businessman who decides to refuse to get involved with another family's connections to the drug business, thinking it to be morally wrong. When an assassination attempt on his life leaves the Boss in a critical condition, his sons must take over the day to day operations in the midst of the war that has been started. Throughout the film we see the truth behind the violence, the stress of being involved with a powerful family, and the political undertones of Mafia life. We especially see all of these effects in Michael Corleone. He is the youngest son of Don Corleone, and a war hero. However, due to the things happening throughout the story, Michael portrays a man's descent into a different life. Some great things about this movie are first off, the acting. Each person in this movie, no matter how small their role is, has a story to tell and they all tell those stories beautifully. Second, the language. Many scenes in this movie are spoken almost exclusively in Italian. Without subtitles. It added an authenticity unlike any movie I've seen before. Beautifully well done, excellently put together, an obvious masterpiece, even with being very slow paced at times. If you have yet to see this film, do so this instant."
4576,True,"I must confess, I find it really tricky to watch movies that are considered ""The Greatest of All Time"", because of one enormous fear: What if I don't like it? Sure, you don't have to stick to social majorities when forming your opinion on a film, but I suppose there's a certain reaction that comes when you say something like: ""Yeah, I wasn't so seen on The Shawshank Redemption, actually"". So this was my worry when I finally purchased ""The Godfather"" trilogy on DVD, and sat down to watch the first one. Thankfully, I absolutely adored it. It's a film of epic proportions, following 10 years in the history of the Corleone Family, with excellent drama and beautiful cinematography. And it also keeps you interested for the entirety of its 3 hour run time, which is by no means an easy feat.""The Godfather"" follows Don Vito Corleone (played by the masterful Marlon Brando), the head of one of the most powerful mafia families, and his son Michael (Al Pacino), who is soon to take over the family. We begin with Michael's wedding, which uses brilliant juxtapositions between the bright, happy event, and the dark office of the patriarch, where he hears the requests of his family and friends. It's a great scene because we realise the image that the family tries to send out, and the actual goings on behind the scenes. We also observe the power and influence that the family has in places like the media (involving the head of a certain animal¬Ö), so that we can then understand how much of a force to be reckoned with they are.The film takes place over 10 years, and packs a lot of events into 3 hours, from the attempted assassination of Vito, to Michael's refuge in Sicily. Coppola shows us so clearly how life in a mafia family is a dangerous one, where you always have to watch your back and where people are always trying to kill you. Thanks to the character of Kay (played by a young Diane Keaton), we get an outsider's perspective on the family too, and Michael tries to show her that the business will become 'legitimate' soon, although we knows this is unlikely. The greatest sequence in the film is also one of the most famous ¬ñ the massacre that takes place during a christening, with sinister Bach organ music played over the top. It's a fantastic section because Coppola is contrasting life and death so well, making us aware of the cycle of mafia life.""The Godfather"" is truly one of the great masterpieces of cinema. It's complex and often slow going, but always reaches points which make waiting worthwhile. The acting is totally stunning, which Pacino and Brando shining in particular in their roles, and the whole film is shot with a dark, noir-ish lens. Every part of it is well thought out, particularly its score and pacing, and you can appreciate it at the end as both a great feat of filmmaking, and a satisfying watch. I was extremely pleased to find how much I enjoyed watching this incredible film, and can't wait to tuck into the rest of the trilogy."
4577,True,"The Godfather is a 1972 masterpiece. It is based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, and stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. The story of the movie takes place from 1945 to 1955. It the best movie about the Mafia. In addition, many have called it the best movie of all time. A sequel, The Godfather Part II, was released in 1974 and won another Best Picture Oscar, too. It was the only sequel to do so until 2003's The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The third movie in the Godfather trilogy, The Godfather Part III, came out in 1990. I think it was not as good as the other two movies. Even though if we think the trilogy as one movie, it is the greatest work of the seventh art, I think."
4578,True,"The Godfather is a great movie. From it's writing, directing and of course, the acting. The whole cast commits to their roles but the few that stands out are Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall. My favourite scene is where Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) kills Virgil Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey at dinner. It's one of those rare feelings you have during a scene where you are cheering but feel guilty about it. What's incredible is that every scene is memorable in different ways. This is credit to the writers, Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo and the director, again, Francis. The writing and directing is spot on, but I forgot another great artist, Gordon Willis, the cinema photographer. The film looks amazing, especially on the restoration and blu ray. This is one of the best movies ever made and every film lover should see it."
4579,True,"The Godfather is quite simply the best film of all time. The film really sets of the groundbreaking genre of mafia/gangster films. This film follows the New York mafia family in 1940's America as they try protect and build upon their empire whilst challenged by rival families. This film is filled with outstanding performances, Al Pacino plays the role of the son who is against everything the family stands for but throughout the film slowly finds himself going against everything he believed in and consequently joining their ways and eventually becoming the leader of the family after Don Corleone's life comes to an end. This film marks the start of Al Pacino's outstanding career and is still one of his best performances to this day. Marlon Brando playing the main role as Don Corleone in the film is at his very best and absolutely deserved his Academy Award for his performance. He gives a real sense of realism to the film and shows us the intelligence and pride in the mafia rather than the criminality and violence people stereotype the mafia with. John Cazale, who plays Fredo, gives the performance of a lifetime as he plays the runt of the family, lacking intelligence and bravery and will never live up to his father's aspirations for him. He always lives in the shadow of his two brothers and is seen as inferior to them throughout, Cazale shows psychological realism as we see his struggle to come to terms with his inferiority. This film portrays the Mafia in a way which we find ourselves sympathizing with the characters despite their criminal antics. Which is astonishing to see due to the severity of their crimes. Many films such as Donnie Brasco, Casino and Goodfella's have tried to replicate the outstanding way in which the mafia is portrayed in this masterpiece but no film has ever matched up.With unforgettable quotes and scenes, you will never watch a film so compelling in your life. With a mixture of outstanding acting, directing, writing and music this is an all time classic. The defining film of Francis Ford Coppola's career. The only film that could ever compare : Part II.A truly unmissable film."
4580,True,"I'd been putting off watching The Godfather for some time. Probably because I knew it was a long, weighty movie with a massive reputation and I wanted to make sure I gave it justice.Well I finally took the plunge and watched it, and I'm sorry to say I don't know what all the fuss is about. This probably won't be very popular - but this movie is way way too slow. There is a lot of talking and very little action, which would be OK if the dialogue was special - it isn't.What saves The Godfather for me is the performances. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in particular - you can tell they are at the peak of their powers and giving the performance everything. Their characters are complex and interesting. Brando as Don Vito Corleone is a criminal but with a good heart. Al Pacino wants to avoid crime but he has a streak of evil in him. The development of the characters and handover of the criminal empire keeps the otherwise dull storyline ticking over.I've given this movie a 7/10 on the strength of the performance, but I won't be watching it again."
4581,True,"The Ten Lessons I Learned With ""The Godfather""Lesson I:""A truly rich man is one who has powerful friends."" Surround yourself with people as much or more influence, intelligence and power you have. They will be useful to ensure a good view them from society.Lesson II:""Do not hate your enemies, disrupts reasoning."" The less they know who your enemies are, the better.

4582,True,"OK so if you have even the slightest knowledge of American film you know about the film The Godfather, and chances are that you don't need me to tell you how great it is. However I love talking about my favorite films, and so I am writing this review mostly just for my own enjoyment.First let me touch on the acting and the characters. The acting in The Godfather is some of the best acting ever put on the big screen, boasting the two names Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, both of which are acting legends. First let me touch on Al Pacino's performance. What makes Al Pacino's performance as Michael Corleone so incredible is the character's transformation from the beginning of the film to the end. At the start of the film, Michael tells his girlfriend Kate that he is not like his father. He does not kill or steal, which is true in the beginning. However, as the film progresses, he turns into a much different man than he is at the start of the film, and by the end becomes almost the exact opposite of what he was, eventually being the cause of one of the best endings to a film in the history of cinema. I don't need to tell you what that ending is. On the other hand, Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is also incredible for many of the same reasons. His character also changes from the start of the film to the end because in the end, he is the one to make peace with the other families. He, in the end, becomes what Michael was at the beginning of the film. Michael on the other hand becomes what his father was in the beginning, and both actors are able to portray this change so, so well. One of the best things about The Godfather is that you can watch it over and over again, and it really does get better with every viewing. My first watching of The Godfather, I immediately hailed it as one of my favorites, and every time I have watched it since I have actually liked it even more. Not many films have such a high replay value, and a replay value is always the sign of a great film. I could watch The Godfather once a week and it would never get old, and that is one of the best compliments I could give a film. However there is an experience for the first time viewer when you hear Michael say ""Yes I do denounce him,"" for the first time, and you experience the onslaught that follows that iconic line. Over all, as most would agree, The Godfather is undeniably one of the greatest films ever made. I cannot pick my top favorite film of all time, but this is definitely in my top 5, and probably in my top 3. If you have not seen The Godfather, do yourself a favor and see why it is hailed as one of the greatest films ever made.The Godfather obviously gets a 10 out of 10"
4583,True,"The Godfather Review by FUTURE TV (Al Carlson)The Godfather is a film considered by most to be one of the greatest ever made. From The American Film Institute to as voted by users on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) it is consider to be one of the best. As a film that ranks as high as other masterpieces including Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction and 12 Angry Men, The Godfather is an exceptional piece of cinema excellence that is flawless and is simply the pinnacle crime drama.The Godfather revolves around the Corleone's, an Italian family with deep roots in the New York City mafia. The head of the Corleone's is Don Vito Corleone, a man who takes care of his family and demands respect in return. His son Michael however, who just returned home from World War II, doesn't want to become involved with the family business. The Sollozzo's, a family of drug dealers, confront Don and request protection in exchange for profits from the Sollozzo's drug sales. But Don declines the offer, for he is against selling narcotics. The rejected offer starts what turns into an all out mafia war between the two families with Michael diving deep into the mafia lifestyle.The characters are portrayed by a legendary all-star cast including Marlon Brando as Don, Al Pacino as his son Michael and James Caan as Don's oldest son Sonny. The casting for this film has been considered by many to be the best casted film in history for their astonishing performances. All three main actors were nominated for an academy award, but only Marlon Brando won an Oscar for best actor in a leading role. It's fascinating to watch how these characters change over the course of the movie, with one in particular changing drastically.Directer Francis Ford Coppola, being raised in an Italian-American family in New York, understood Italian culture exceptionally and made the film very authentically. Everything from the wedding dances to the cuisine to the terms used by the characters in Sicilian come from Coppola's first-hand knowledge of Italian-American culture. Italian composer Nino Rota did an outstanding job making the soundtrack for the film, despite not getting the Oscar for best music (but he did win an Oscar for his work in the sequel, The Godfather: Part II). Virtually everyone recognizes that iconic trumpet solo once it starts playing. He also wrote the score for another great Italian film 8 1/2. This film should be immediately followed up by it's sequel, The Godfather: Part II, which also won best picture. The series still holds the title of most best picture awards for a film series to this day. They're both flawless crime dramas and have earned their titles as some of the best pieces of cinema ever. I will guarantee you won't be able to see this film only once, as it gets better after continual viewings. There is really nothing more to add other than if you haven't seen this movie yet, it's about time you did. The Godfather is a movie you can't refuse."
4584,True,"Mario Puzo creates a magnificent movie - a must watch, especially for the crime lovers. Though, not crime, but politics. In this movie, a complete world of the underworld is shown. Don Vito Corleone, the head of the Corleone family, and almost the most powerful leader in the five families that make the main pentagon of the underworld. Vito Corleone has his two sons - Santino Corleone and Michael Corleone. His consigliere, Tom Hagens, who is also said as the brothers of Sunny and Michael after he was adopted.The main feature over which a director should notice is developing character for actors in a film. The guy Mario Puzo did this majestically. He developed the character of Sunny Corleone as emotional, from the start after he hit a photographer while he developed a calm character for Tom and Michael both. Another flamboyant work done by the director was that Michael wasn't so emotional and like aggressive. But the director showed that a little of his father genes went into him. And he got paranoid with the passage of time. That's the work of a brilliant director that you show reality.Vito Corleone makes his way through the five families and everything is going calmly before the Don is attacked at a time. His bodyguard Paulie was bribed and he was shown as sick, therefore, the Don didn't take Paulie with him and took his another adopted son Freddie. But Freddie is not so cunning and is shown as less intelligent and less clever. The gangsters attack and Freddie's gun falls as the Don is buying fruits. Hence the Don gets shot but he is still not dead, he survives.Michael handles the responsibility with Tom and goes on."
4585,True,"Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can understand just by the way the characters look at each other and talk to each other. Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so ""The Godfather"" becomes something of a rarity. So much so that ""The Godfather"" (played brilliantly by Marlon Brando) himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael (Al Pacino), who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprise. Pacino plays Michael close to his vest; he has learned from his father never to talk in front of outsiders, never to trust anyone unnecessarily, to take advice but keep his own counsel. What else can I say about this movie that no one else has said: it's a classic and for good reason."
4586,True,"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part- II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes."
4587,True,"This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life, it is simply perfect in pretty much every aspect of it, from it's acting, to it's writing, this movie has it all. It stars Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, son of Don Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando in his greatest performance. Michael at first tries to stay away from the family business, but after his father is almost assassinated by rivals, he volunteers to murder the responsible, and after his father dies he takes the family business leading to the second installment in the Godfather trilogy. My favorite part of the movie is the baptism scene, which showcases both Michael's descent into darkness, and Francis Ford Coppola's great talent in directing. So in summary this is simply the best movie I've ever seen in my entire life."
4588,True,"This film is often regarded as perfect including the acting which is renowned as some of the best in the history of cinema. However I was quite underwhelmed by the performances except for Marlon Brando who is truly captivating whenever he is on screen (which is surprisingly not that often considering he won best LEAD actor for his performance.) Even Al Pacino's performance is both emotionless and forgettable in my opinion. I'm not going to waste time talking about everything that makes this film good because everyone has done that. What I am going to do is just mention some of the reasons why, overall, I was disappointed in the film. My first problem with the film is that I often found the story stretched thin by too many characters and occasionally found myself confused by the many unfamiliar Italian names that kept popping up. The first two hours of the film are exceptionally entertaining, well made and expertly written. However it is around the two hour mark where what was making the story so captivating is almost completely resolved and we are then forced to sit through another hour of a film that is no longer all that interesting. The three hour run time of the film is certainly unnecessary as even though seeing Michael take over the reigns of the family and watching Vito die is still great stuff it feels like it could have been covered in 15 minutes instead of adding another hour to a film that felt like it had already ended. I do understand that my opinion will not be popular but I felt that I should mention my problems with the film and stop some people being brainwashed by its 9.2 IMDb rating and then instantly saying that its a masterpiece so they could be accepted even though they may have found parts of it boring. I don't know... Perhaps my expectations were too high."
4589,True,i like it the best movie ever performance acting and direction the best gangster movie and its a criterion for all gangsters movies i have seen it from 6 years ago and love to watch it more and more every scene every quote every word i love the all characters its must be the number one in top 250. the best rule ever is Marlon Brando i have never seen acting like this AL Pacino it was the third movie for him he is a great actor every actor has been chosen proficiently when Francis ford Coppola has been asked about the actors performance he said because i chose them he is a great director the godfather trilogy is a diamond and i think they are the best of the best
4590,True,"There is nothing to say on this movie, except an awesome movie i ever seen in my life and also hope no movie come like this. I like Micheal corleaon charter and Vito corleaon voice very much. First two movies are awesome but the third one have some disadvantages that's why i didn't like that a lot but that one is good too. A very good family war between five families. Corleaon family manage everything between families. I play GodFather game also but after when i see this movie. Now i am playing it on Kabam.com. I only want to say that i like this movie a a lot that way i do a lot with this movie. I accept that these types of films come in future also so that we give 10 ratings and have some enjoyment in our life.Thanks Regards Sam"
4591,True,"Beautiful FIlm! The first time I saw him I was really surprised ... I think it is an absolute masterpiece of world cinema. I live among each other in one of the places where it was the scene of the encounter with Apollonia and subsequent marriage to Michael Corleone. It 'a film that appeals to all ages, however long, is full of twists and ideas more than interesting. My favorite character is Don Vito in which the wise direction of Francis Ford Coppola has allowed us to create a character that would become an icon of international cinema. I can not add anything to what has already been said to the Godfather ... I am sure that will continue to stay on top of forever, is a film that will never go out of fashion!"
4592,True,"A great film ... storyline, frameworks, so complex characters, the actors enter the characters so well in their ... undoubtedly a film that deserves a place of honor in the collection of films each ... If you saw the movie, try and book of the same title by Mario Puzzo ... simply help visual memory to ""see"" the characters ... the book is very good and worth reading after you see the movie. Marlon Brando's performance is magnificent, it's the perfect actor for the role. The storyline is as good, and the whole cast has done its job and actors including Duval, De Niro and Al Pacino. Not very often blends so well a movie. In the second part of the movie was pretty broken thread by death character Don Vito Corleone. Al Pacino seemed too young for the part."
4593,True,"One of the best, if not the best Crime and Mob war movie ever made, including one of my favorite actor, Al Pacino. The whole series is awesome, full of action and drama. 10/10The actors are all great, especially ""Don Corleone"" and Al Pacino, the story is great, the way that Al Pacino becomes the new Don, and his family is still in danger and haunted is amazing.IF you haven't seen the movie I suggest you do, even if you are not in the genre, and if you liked it you might as well watch Scarface or Gangster Squad.Great Movie, 10 out of 10. -Remus"
4594,True,This movie is one of my favorites but I do have some problems with it.1. Michael goes from a nice guy that doesn't want to be like his family to a cold and menacing crime lord rather quickly and without any real buildup.2. Sudden time jumps without you even noticing until one of the characters points them out or you just have to realize it by yourself. I mean come on at least give us some indication that some time is going to pass.3. Did I miss something ? When did they say that Connie and Carlo have had another baby? I don't know maybe it is my mistake but I'm going to point it out anyway.While Michael is still in Italy we can clearly see that Connie is pregnant and is soon going to have a baby.And after Michael returns home the movie jumps forward a few years where we can clearly see that Michael has a 3year old son.But then in one scene Michael is asked to be a godfather to Connies and Carlos son! I was like WTH ?! I had to Google it to find out that they have had another son.
4595,True,"The Godfather The film The Godfather takes place in New York and some parts of Italy during the mob era in the late 1930's and '40's. The story begins with a mob boss Don Vito Corleone, also known as the Godfather, who conducts ""business"" out of his office. The scenes that take place here are where most plots and deals are being prepared. Usually trouble is being made when scenes take place here. Corleone is asked by a New York gangster, Sollozzo, for protection in exchange for profit from the drug trafficking business. Advised by his adopted son and family lawyer, Tom Hagen, and since he is not fond of drugs, Corleone decides to decline Sollozzo's offer. Following an assassination attempt on Corleone conducted by Sollozzo, his oldest son Sonny takes over the family business. Soon after this assignment to power, Sonny is assassinated. The next in line is Corleone's youngest son, Michael, the main character, who is a World War II hero. Michael had vowed to never become part of the family business but is slowly falling into the position due to his brother's death. After he is involved in a mob killing, Michael is forced to move to Sicily, where his father was born, until everything calms down. A movement that is frequently seen throughout the film is hand gestures. These are usually made as a signal for help, to kill someone or used to get a point across. An object that is seen often during the film is a gun. The gun represents quick resolution and necessity for survival.Although this film is a classic, it isn't well written because the scenes were scattered. It was also hard to follow and I had to watch it twice in order to understand what was happening. In addition, it was very lengthy. It seemed like there pointless scenes in the film.In The Godfather the viewer is able to see the different groups of people throughout the movie. One of the main groups in the movie is Don Corleone and his sons. Another group is the heads of the five families. These men would meet during movie to negotiate money, territory and other things that involve mob concerns. A different group in the film is the rest of the family. These people are important because the mobsters cherish, protect and believe family comes first against anything.In the film little things are the cause of big things. For instance, when Don Corleone decided to decline from Sollozzo's offer, the consequence was the hit that Sollozzo put on him. Another example is when Sonny's sister was beat by her husband Sonny decides to go after him but ends up trapped at the toll booth where he was assassinated. A similar example is after Sonny is killed, Michael becomes head of the family business. All films are uncanny. The Godfather is my MLK film, therefore it is uncanny.From the film I learned that even though you are in a ""family"" business you still are not able to trust anyone fully. The message of this movie is that when conducting a business there is always someone out to get you. Especially when you are at the top you have to watch your surroundings and who you decide to trust because once you at the top the only direction you can go is downward."
4596,True,"Once again delving into IMDb's Top 250, we come upon The Godfather. Long since clich√©d in its use of ""Offer you can't refuse"", the horse incident and its view of the mafia, Godfather remains compelling 40 years after its release.Vito Corleone is on his last legs. As he enjoys his daughter's wedding, the cesspool of mafiosi politicking makes hay behind his back as his sons vie for control of the family and a monopoly over their section of New York. We see the brutality and efficiency of said underworld at is pinnacle when Corleone convinces a movie producer to give a friend of his a part by beheading his prize horse and leaving the ""note"" in his bed. Any attempt at normalcy is doomed as families are torn apart by violence, secrecy, jealousy and anger as husbands gamble human freight to gain more influence in their inner circles.Marlon Brando is excellent as the Corleone clan's ""eminence grise"", who wryly dies of natural causes while one of his sons is gunned down at a toll, ostensibly for his actions toward other clans as well as his wife. Betrayals are repaid with quick deaths and the juxtaposition of Michael in a church forsaking violence and hatred (Satan) while eliminating his rivals in the background is chilling.The epic lasts a good 10 years as we see the evolution of mafia reach from simple prostitution and bribery and gambling to include illicit drugs, somewhat half-heartedly. At the end, Michael Corleone stands alone as Godfather and alone as husband, betraying his wife's trust to keep silent his actions with the Corleone clan. The Godfather is still an epic, sprawling masterpiece that doesn't seem out of date in 2012, scary a thought as that is..."
4597,True,"This was the biggest grossing film in 1972 when it was released and I am told that it follows closely to the Mario Puzo novel of the same name. The movie is followed by two sequels, which at first I believed were a part of the novel, but later realised that in fact they were separate. They seem to all meld together into one epic, though I will treat them all as separate movies, though I will refer back to the previous films occasionally.In this movie (which I believe to be the best) we watch the internal and external struggles of the Corleone family and how things slowly change in the life of young Michael Corleone. Michael (Al Pachino) is the central character in the film, though the others of his family, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), Sonito Corleone (James Caan), and Tom Hagan (Robert Duval) are of importance. Looking at the cast though, there are some very competent, and surprising, actors that appear in here. In fact I was surprised to see Diane Keaton (who plays Kay Adams, Michael Corleone's wife) in the film, but then I only just recently saw it for the first time.This movie is a tale of epic proportions and we watch here how Michael changes through the events of the movie. In the background of war and violence in the streets of New York, Michael, who wants to remain distant from the criminal ways of his family, yet feeling ties of loyalty to his family, is slowly pulled into it. The turning point comes when he is in the hospital to find that all of his father's guards have vanished and he has to make a decision to remain apart from the criminal aspects of his family, or to dive in and save his father's life.I guess one of the major things here is that you are what you are. No matter how much Michael tries to deny his family's business, he cannot escape the inevitable fact that it is criminal. Even though he could simply walk away from him family, he feels loyal and devoted to him, and even though his father his a criminal, he loves him.Another interesting thing that I read was in regards to the treatment of women in the film. The film is divided into spheres: the domestic and the business sphere. In the movie all of the women are in the domestic sphere and are not allowed to enter into the business sphere. The movie also details violence towards women to force them into that domestic role. We have the woman that is talked about at the beginning who is violently violated and the man seeking justice. We have the young Corrie who is married at the beginning, kept away from the family business, and beaten up when she refuses to work in the domestic sphere. We have Michael's first wife who is learning to drive, only to be blown up when she starts the car and finally there is Kay Adams, who at the end of the movie is shut out of the business end of the family, after being lied to by Michael.The movie also deals with respect, in a little bit. At the beginning, Marlon Brando gives a monologue regarding how the man petitioning him only comes to him when he is in trouble, and is never treating him as a friend or even a Godfather. It is not that he does not want to help him, but that he would like to be a friend to the man as opposed to somebody who is only visited when there is trouble.This movie is epic in proportions, but it is too detailed in places. It is long, and even though some long movies, such as Thin Red Line, are good despite their length, others are simply way too long to really want to sit down and watch. In fact, it took me a while to actually sit and watch these movies because of their length."
4598,True,"I watched the movie for the first time yesterday. I have heard about it growing up, everyone constantly quotes the famous ""Godfather"" but it wasn't until yesterday that I understand why this movie has gained so much admiration, and maintained this strong momentum throughout the years. A chef d'oeuvre is an understatement, it is by far the best movie I have ever seen, and I have seen many good movies.The directing is breathtaking, especially the scenes in Sicily, they're so strong ¬ñ they take you to another world, a world of traditions and values while haunted with violence and power. I loved how Michael Corleone met his first wife, how he went to ask for permission to see her again. It was such a pure and innocent relationship, and the Sicilian background strengthened the purity in the relationship. It is very interesting to see how purity and power meet.The acting is so spectacular and the chemistry between the characters is very strong. All relationships are so beautifully depicted: the husband / wife (Michael and Kay), father / son / grandson, father / daughter, brother / sister, etc. The character of Connie was particularly interesting in my view, and how it was able to evolve from the oppressed wife in the first movie, to the rebel in the second, and finally the head of the house in the third, and the person who held the family together in a time of tension. The strongest character however and the most captivating in my view is Michael. His extraordinary ability to talk to people, to negotiate while maintaining calm and this poker face of his makes you fall in love.Finally, the music adds a very strong touch to the movie. In takes you back in time, and blends your emotions with those of the actors. It was amazingly played in the very last scene of Godfather III, in the opera house. The scene is very sad, but it gave me tears to the eye not because of sadness for what has happened but for emotion on the artistic beauty of it.You will fall in love with the movie and with every one of the characters. You become addicted to power and greed. Francesco Coppola is really able to submerge you into this wonderful experience. experience."
4599,True,"The core of 'The Godfather' may be pinpointed in one scene. The youngest son of the Corleone crime family, Michael, wrestles with the possible fate of his and his family's fortunes as he sits across a restaurant table from the gangster, Salazzo, hungry for the power of the Corleones and the police chief in his employ. He looks down, wide eyed in thought but also at the raging fires of the abyss as he contemplates whether to flee the scene and secure the downfall of his family or kill the two figures who most immediately threaten his family and interests. A train's wheels on the track become the wailing of the damned as Michael pulls himself out of these thoughts, pulls out a gun and kills them. So begins Michael's inexorable slide into powerful evil. In exile from is double murder charge, in Sicily, he is able to flex fledgling muscles of power and suffers not a little tragedy. These are inoculations, tinctures of the life he will embrace when he returns to America. It is as if his soul feeds on these morsels to steel itself for the trials and tribulations of the rank of Don.The wise-cracking college kid who displayed some bemusement at his family's business returns to embrace it more vigorously and more purposefully than his father ever did. His father became a powerful criminal out of necessity, Michael does it as if to prove his mettle, that he can be greater than his father and combines traits of his brothers - Santino's rage and warrior spirit, Fredo's duplicity and Tom Hagen's cunning - to achieve his goal.As the door finally closes on Kay at the end of the film, the door closes on the Michael she fell in love with all those years before."
4600,True,"Rewatched this for the first time in about 12 years. The last time I saw it I don't think I was ready to appreciate it's brilliance, as it was a tad slow for me back then. Glad I did.There's no real point reviewing it, basically most people know what's it's about and know it's universally regarded as one of the best movies of all-time. Here's some reasons why.-Brando as Don Corleone. Brilliant -Pacino as Michael. Brilliant. -The directing of Coppola. Brilliant. Beautifully shot movie with some landmark scenes, most notably Sonny's death and the restaurant scene. -Excellent storyThe movie holds up very well, albeit it's a bit slow at times. Here's 3 scenes that could have been improved.-Michael moving his father in the hospital. Should have been some guys inside who Michael had to fight off. -When Sonny beats up Carlo. Really poorly done. -The restaurant scene. Didn't use the suspense enough, could have drawn out some more.A brilliant movie, must-see for major movie factors."
4601,True,"Honestly, I don't know a single respectable person who doesn't like this film. It is perfect from every angle and is enormously culturally significant.From the start when we are introduced to Don Vito, to the end where we see the conflicted Michael take control of the dark empire of his father, every scene is captured masterfully. With such a great cast including Al Pacino, James Caan, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, with the ever masterful direction of Francis Ford Coppola, it is difficult to see this film ever failing.Not only performance and direction-wise, it follows the book very well, too. Sure, some subplots are deleted, but with an already immense running time of 3 hours, backgrounds of minor characters like Al Neri and Rocco Lampone will be missed, but accepted as non existent.Overall, this film is perfect."
4602,True,"This is my most favorite movie of all time.Words cannot describe its greatness.I have heard all kinds of stories about when it first came out and how people were constantly praising it but it's for a reason believe me.This film has the finest acting i have ever seen.You don't believe - then watch this masterpiece and see what i'm talking about.All the actors shine:Al Pacino,Robert Duvall,James Caan and the others were born to play their roles and you can see how passionate they were while playing.But the greatest one of them all is undoubtedly the GREAT Marlon Brando who was so eager to play the role that he sent director F.F.Coppola a tape on which he presents his way of playing the Godfather.Coppola is immediately impressed and hires Brando.From here it's all history in the making.The most emotional and powerful moment is when the Godfather gets shot.Pure brilliance.Every time I see that scene it sends shivers down my spine.If I have to be honest every scene has its impact and emotional message.If you haven't seen the movie yet fix your mistake and watch it right now.You'll be amazed!!!"
4603,True,"The very best film of the seventies. The very best film of the 20th Centuatry, the very best film of all time. Most definitely. While it's not my favourite film, (Pulp Fiction is the No. 1) It's in my opinion the best. The story is brilliant. The scenes whether the baptism scene or Sonnys death scene or that horribly grisly scene which involves one man one bed and a certain part of a horse, are memorable. The acting is superb. Marlon Brando's best even when he'd already played Terry Malloy and Stanly Kowloski (Two of the very best performances ever). Al Pacino's, despite what many Scarface fans might say, best performance he is great in Part One yet he is chillingly stupendous in Part 2. The list goes on. James Caan, Diane Keaton, John Cazele all shine in their own great light. Many people talk about this film but they can never sum it up right. Neither can I. It may not be the most realistic Mob film, Goodfellas would be the most in my opinion, it portrays the Italian mob so well, if anybody told me it was much different i would eat my hat. The funny thing about this is no matter how brilliant this film is the book is much better. If you haven't read or seen this film you haven't lived. Period..."
4604,True,"Up until I saw the Godfather, I did not truly understand what was a good movie. This is the best movie of all time. After initially watching the movie, I sat down and watched it again and appreciated the film even more. This movie is filled with classic scenes and classic lines. Marlon Brando is outstanding as Don Vito Corleone and equally good is Al Pacino. The scene in which Michael kills the policemen and the drug-lord is one of my favorites. The sound of a train builds and you can feel the intense passion of Michael Corleone. The transformation of Michael Corleone into a Don at the end of the movie is moving and underlies the central theme of family in the movie. Furthermore, the art direction is unbelievable with the footage in Italy and the wedding scene, both of which shaped film direction for latter generations of film makers. This movie is truly a gem and the best film of all time. Two thumbs way up!!"
4605,True,"Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the aging Don of the Corleone crime family, the strongest of the five Mafia families in New York City (Barzini, Tattaglia, Cuneo, and Stracci are their rivals). He has four sons: Santino ""Sonny"" (James Caan), Frederico ""Fredo"" (John Cazele) Michael (Al Pacino), his adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), who serves as the family consigliere, and a daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Sonny is the underboss of the family. With Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano) and Salvatore Tessio (Abe Vigoda) are the caporegimes. Soldiers under Clemenza and Tessio include Paulie Gatto (Joe Martino), Willy Cici (Joe Spinelli) and Rocco Lampone (Tom Rosqui), and more. Michael wants nothing to do with ""the family"" and attempts to legitimize himself by going to college and the army, while his brothers are trying very hard to establish their names in the city through the Mafia underworld.The Corleone family soon become engaged in a ten-year war against the other families. They nearly slip from power. But they stand their ground and fight for their power.The Godfather is based on the bestselling novel by Mario Puzo, who co-wrote the screenplay with director Francis Ford Coppola. The movie remains about 90% true to Puzo's masterpiece of a book, only tossing out flashback scenes (which are instead moved into The Godfather Part II) and killing off two characters that weren't killed in the book.The Godfather has earned its place in cinema history, it is considered a landmark film. This is a movie about family and careers. Not an accurate picture of a gangster's life, but still one of the greatest movies based around the Mafia. For an accurate look at mob life, watch Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas or Mike Newell's Donnie Brasco. The movie also started James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Al Pacino's careers. All of these men are accomplished actors now.Marlon Brando earned a well-deserved Academy award for Best Actor because of his superb performance as Don Vito Corleone. The movie also earned Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay. The movie certainly deserved all of its awards.I, as well as many others, hold the film in high regard. This film is a masterpiece. If you haven't seen it, YOU MUST.10/10"
4606,True,"The GodfatherThis is one of the greatest movies ever made. Second only to Goodfellas and tied with The Godfather Part II this is the 2nd greatest movie ever made. The movie is nearly perfect.Plot: The plot is amazing. Based on the fantastic book by Mario Puzo this cuts the book down into 3 hours. Although I like the book better, it doesn't make the movie any less.Acting: While the plot is great, the acting is probably the strongest point in the entire movie. While I Goodfellas is just barely superior, the acting in The Godfather is superior to Goodfellas. Marlon Brando gives a very convincing performance as Don Vito Corleone(aka The Godfather) and won the Academy Award. James Caan also gives a great performance as Santino 'Sonny' Corleone which got him an Academy Award nomination. Robert Duvall: Academy Award Nomination. The biggest surprise however when this movie was released was Al Pacino. He's my favorite actor alongside De Niro and he shot to stardom overnight with his performance as Michael Corleone, giving a sympathetic yet chilling performance. Also got a nomination and should have won.Genre/Quality: As a crime film it is a great movie. The only thing that made it less of a crime film than Goodfellas is that Goodfellas gave a more realistic and gritty look at the crime world. It isn't until Godfather Part 3 that it shows the complete dark side of the mob. This one in some ways seems to glorify it. The quality is great. Francis Ford Coppola decolorized it a bit giving it a more realistic tan look. Some of the greatest scenes ever were filmed in this movie. Finally the music is fantastic.If Goodfellas had not been made, this and The Godfather Part II would have been the two greatest films ever made.10/10"
4607,True,The Godfather is the first and arguably the greatest of The Godfather trilogy with excellent acting on all parts most especially that of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. The films excellent portrayal of Mafia's during the 40's and the transfer of power between Vito and Micheal which is eventually well summed up in part II (Which if you haven't seen I would highly recommend it.) While The film may not have all the action and cool tones of Goodfella's (which I very much so enjoyed) The godfather is clearly a better film with a much more fascinating plot and classic moments. The Godfather is a film where I would make no changes whatsoever weather it be acting or story the film is essentially perfect. I would recommend this film to anyone regardless of their taste in film.
4608,True,"This is probably one of the most nearly perfect films ever made. A dark and twisted version of the ""immigrant to America makes good"" story is wonderfully presented. No small amount of credit for the quality of this movie should go to Mario Puzo's original novel. That novel helped make terms like ""make your bones"" and ""have a sit-down"" and ""capos"" popular. Francis Ford Coppola likes to dump on the whole ""gynecological repair job"" section of the novel but that seems like petty griping compared with the way that book gave him a can't-miss blueprint for the film. Coppola's change of the closing ceremony to a baptism instead of a confirmation was inspired but for the most part the book is so closely followed Puzo practically deserved a co-director credit.This film proved you don't need constant footage of guns blazing to make a successful and memorable gangster movie. The fact that it nicely retains the source material's sub-text ensured its greatness."
4609,True,"I read some of the other reviews that people posted and wanted to say it was quite possibly the greatest movie ever! For those who voted it badly, I can see why..partially. The first time I saw it for some reason, I couldn't get into it. I had to stop it and continue watching it another day. It seemed to bore me. That is until they whacked off a few of the best characters in the movie. I swear I could hardly recover from those blows. When they Killed Sonny I couldn't believe it!!! He was my favorite actor in the movie as with Marlon Brando! At least the movie did it so tastefully that even in the manner of their deaths, I was shocked by the delievery of them. Although I must say they should have put more details in with Sonny's death, The effects weren't that great plus I'm beginning to think he is like tony Montana because he gets rittled with at least 4 tommygun rounds and still manages to get out of the car and goes down after 10 rounds; remarkable! If I were him I would have at least floored it!!!! NOT GET OUT OF THE CAR!"
4610,True,"The Godfather has everything that quality cinema needs, gripping story, a fantastic script and marvellous acting.The Godfather is an adaptation from the novel with the same title. Marlon Brando plays the character of Don Vito Corleone with complete emotion, meaning and accuracy. Al pacino's character of Michael Corleone and son of the Don. These two main characters grip the audience throughout the epic tale of gangland New York and the changes through the mid 20th Century. Through Don Vitos decline as the Godfather the reluctant Michael is dragged further in. Pacino performs his greatest part through this. The Godfather is Francis Coppola's greatest work among many classics. The story of a great family in the dark gangland years of New York will be one of the most recognised in 20th century cinema."
4611,True,"In 1940's New York, Vito Corleone is the head of a powerful organised crime syndicate, but he is ageing, rival gangs are vying for control and the new racket - narcotics - offends him. Fiercely protective of his family and business interests, what does his future hold ?For me, this is the ultimate revivalist picture - nobody had made a gangster movie for ten years and from out of nowhere Coppola made this stunning, sweeping, moody and evocative classic which not only smashed box-office records but became (and still is) the definitive gangster film. Aside from the incredible style, what appeals to me most is the grand tragedy of the movie; although he's a crook, we can't help but admire Vito's world-weary pragmatism, moral code and love for his children, and shiver at Michael's descent from innocent to avenger to cold-blooded killer. Vito's acute sense of failure, particularly in the garden scene, is as heart-wrenching as any of the (memorable) action or suspense scenes. The whole movie is a catalogue of stunning sequences though - the opulent wedding-party, the horse's-head-in-the-bed, the deserted hospital (my favourite), Sonny's bullet-ridden death on the causeway, the assassination in the cafe, the final montage intercut with the christening - all simply breathtaking. The performances are sensational, with many great little bits by the lower-order players (Marley as the bigoted studio boss, Lettieri as the kingpin, Castellano as the cheery Clemenza, Montana as the unfortunate Luca Brasi), but for me, Brando is the heart of this film. He's not my favourite actor - he's a bit pretentious in his angry young man roles and totally loopy in his later ones (see The Missouri Breaks), but this is a masterful performance. He makes the Godfather both real and mythical, simultaneously open-hearted and enigmatic; a rare lead role of a thoughtful old man who, despite all of his courage, power and intelligence, the world ultimately passes by. It's a sensational piece of acting. His line, ""I refused to be a fool, dancing on the string held by all those bigshots."", sums up both his character and the genius of Coppola. The richness of this universal theme is beautifully enhanced by Nino Rota's gorgeous, melancholic score, and the sheer quality of the amazing imagery. This is an incredible tapestry of a picture; an unprecedented critical and commercial success, the grandfather of all movie-brat blockbusters, the most influential crime story ever filmed and an unmissable treat for all connoisseurs of great cinema. Scripted by Coppola and Mario Puzo, from Puzo's bestselling novel. My two favourite pieces of trivia - the writers censored the word mafia from the screenplay, and the baby in the christening sequence is the director's daughter and respected filmmaker in her own right, Sofia Coppola."
4612,True,"If you consider yourself a film fan then you should have seen this film. I don't really care if you didn't enjoy the movie, because in my reviews the only opinion that matters is mine.The Godfather Trilogy is a classic example of movie making, with this opening chapter easily the best of the bunch.Anyway, I can't quite explain why I think this film is so good, as even I don't know. It just is. From the opening conversation about respecting the Godfather to the closing moments when Michael is made Don, the whole film just seeps with brilliance.The drama is well rendered and some moments are quite touching. Other moments, such as the death of Sonny are well worth the wait, and most of the scenes in Sicily are beautifully shot.All-in-all, this is the greatest movie of all time. Genuinely an offer you can't refuse."
4613,True,"Maybe it is simply because I am not from the generation of when this movie came out back in '72, but my god this was a bore.The acting, the script, and even the set of the movie I found to be quite great, as a matter of fact.Aside from that, all I got from this movie was a group of men ramble on and on and on about whatever. This movie did not keep me interested at all. The wedding scene was way too long, there is not much of a build up to anything for the most part. It is as if I am watching family members have conversation, and that's it. The ending scenes I found to be exciting, but at that point I was already tuned out of the movie, and found myself playing temple run just to pass the time. I literally would glance back and forth at the clock just to see how much time this movie took up from my life.So yeah, this movie was a giant bore-fest for me, giving me little to no motivation to watch Part II and Part III."
4614,True,"The godfather is widely regarded as the greatest film ever made in the history of cinema.Widely considered a milestone,the movie inspired countless films. It might be a shame to admit but i hadn't seen this movie until 2015.After nearly 42 years of its release i finally got a chance to watch it.After watching the movie i found its story to familiar.It is because i have watched countless movies which are directly or indirectly inspired by this film and i must say that this movie was far better than those rip- offs. The movie has a great story.It shows the transition of a reluctant family-man to a crime family boss.The screenplay is absorbing.The cast is wonderful and everybody is peerless in their respective roles.In short this film is superb and wonderful.But i can't consider it as a great film.I don't know why it is called so?May be it had been a very original story during 70's but now it is not so.I am not a film scholar,neither i am a movie buff nor a cinema aficionado but i have seen many classics of World cinema and i found some movies which are far better than this one. I am not saying that this is not a great film.It is great,after all so many people like this and so many can't be wrong.This is a respectable movie after all this movie has influenced countless films.This movie might be great but not the greatest ever. This is an excellent example of mobster film.Positive points of this film are its evergreen story,its soulful musical score,its engaging screenplay,nice direction,great dialogs and amazing acting.The only negative point of the movie is its slow pace and overlong runtime.So at last i want to say that it is an awesome piece of art and everybody must watch it.May be due to time difference or due to cultural gap,i was unable to grasp it completely. 7.9 out of 10 is my final rating."
4615,True,"What can you say about this movie?Greatest movie of all time,2 greatest actors working together.Would recommend to everyone.Even if you are not in mafia and killing i think you are going to enjoy watching it. Of course you have to watch second and third part also.In those two parts also awesome actors.You will see how people who came to America had hard life trying to make some money for their family so they can eat and enjoy a little in life.And you will see that family is really everything in life. Its based on true story and five mafia families running New York. Movie is long but you wont even notice when you are having such a great time watching it.I hope this review helped you guys."
4616,True,When I watched this movie back in elementary school much of it didn't make sense. The only parts I wanted to see where the violent ones and there are a fair amount. Then I tried to watch the entire trilogy in middle school and I made until the third movie and it was too boring so I didn't watch it all. Then again in high school I decided to watch the trilogy fully and I finally understood most of the story. Except for the third movie which people say is the worst. I still don't understand the third one. The story just confuses me so much to this day. Most will argue that the second movie was the best and I do agree with it. By now that I think of it all I remember is that that movie was mainly about don Corleones up-bringing and how he met some of the older members of the family like clemenza and tessio. All in all it was a pretty good movie.
4617,True,the best and lovely film al pacino acted ever i love itthe best and lovely film al pacino acted ever i love itthe best and lovely film al pacino acted ever i love itthe best and lovely film al pacino acted ever i love itthe best and lovely film al pacino acted ever i love itthe best and lovely film al pacino acted ever i love itthe best and lovely film al pacino acted ever i love itthe best and lovely film al pacino acted ever i love itthe best and lovely film al pacino acted ever i love itthe best and lovely film al pacino acted ever i love itthe best and lovely film al pacino acted ever i love itthe best and lovely film al pacino acted ever i love itthe best and lovely film al pacino acted ever i love itthe best and lovely film al pacino acted ever i love itthe best and lovely film al pacino acted ever i love itthe best and lovely film al pacino acted ever i love itthe best and lovely film al pacino acted ever i love itthe best and lovely film al pacino acted ever i love itthe best and lovely film al pacino acted ever i love itthe best and lovely film al pacino acted ever i love itthe best and lovely film al pacino acted ever i love itthe best and lovely film al pacino acted ever i love it
4618,True,"One of the awesome movie in my watch list...Hum probably the best . I have seen three part of the movie and each and every part was mind blowing i watch those for many time. The three part of the movie represent the three generation life history.The Morality of the movie reviles at the last seen part last shot( part three) where Michale die and leave one news to us , no matter who you are no matter what you did ...one day nature will return the same what you give to him.at last it was a movie from where we can have many important lesson.I love every character of this movie."
4619,True,"One of the best movie ever made. It will put you in the set and be a part of the Corleone's family. Live inside the movie with the cast and share their memories and their feelings of love, hate and revenge. The acting of Don Corleone and his magnificent voice while stroking a cat at the beginning its a mental picture that will reappear in your head every time someone mentioned the name - Corleone. Inspired from actual events that happened from the 20s all the way to the 60s wrapped around in 3 lengthy but brilliant movies. The movie starts with an introduction to the family which portraits Corleone's family as a very close, respected family that want to try and stay away from trouble."
4620,True,"One of my favorite movies, in conjunction with part II. I can't say much here, but one outstanding element is the thoroughly believable though dramatic transformation of Michael Corleone. How does one who has always steered totally clear of his family's mafia ways, is an ivy league graduate and has returned from WWII as a Marine war hero become a ruthless, murderous gangster? Coppola achieves this tragic fall with remarkable subtlety and skill. Now that his buddy Lucas is done with Star Wars, it's interesting to see that Darth Vader fell due to the same tragic flaw: desiring as much power as possible in order to keep his family safe - even if it means becoming a murderer. (The Godfather is an infinitely better film than any Star Wars flick, though I'm a sentimental fan for life.) The other element I find most compelling is Pacino's projection of intense power and charismatic strength. His quiet words are more terrifying than the yelling and machine gun of any action hero (or even of Tony Montana). I can't help admiring his character, even though he is a criminal. His performance is so intense and convincing, I actually can hardly watch Pacino in anything else. Music, cinematography, acting, dialog, etc. are all phenomenal. It is a near-perfect film and the greatest modern tragedy I've seen."
4621,True,"Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a ""family"" of New York who is happy because Connie (Talia Shire), his daughter, married Carlo (Gianni Russo). But during the party, Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto) is seen in the Don Corleone office asking for ""justice,"" revenge actually against gang members, who brutally beat his daughter because she had refused to have sex to preserve the honor. Vito discusses, but the arguments of the Bonasera sensitize and he promises that the men who abused Bonasera's daughter will not be killed because she was not, but will be severely punished. That's the best film of history, a lot of people don't lie. Vito but makes it clear that it can call Bonasera some day to return the ""favor"". Outside, in the middle of the party, is the third son of Vito, Michael (Al Pacino), a very decorated Navy captain who just returned from the 2nd World War. University educated, sensitive and perceptive, he is hardly noticed by most of those present, except for a college girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), who has Italian descent but he loves. However there is someone who is well noted, Johnny Fontane (Al Martino), a singer of romantic ballads that causes screams of the young people who border on hysteria. Don Corleone already had helped him when Johnny was still in early career and was bound by a contract with the leader of a great band, but Johnny took off career and he wanted to do a solo career. To be his godfather Vito went to see the leader of the band and offered $ 10,000 to let Johnny go, but had refused the request. Just take the pieces of this master piece, like unforgivable actuation, bring proud to family and power. Still hope that one day came a film that compare with this. A realistic and chocking picture of as mafia do their job at 40's. A master piece of incalculable value. Marlon Brando has a perfect actuation, leaving a stone in the cinema as the most respectable and acclaimed character by the public and critics."
4622,True,"This movie is one of those ones that makes you think really deep about life, your life! Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith, in a dark atmosphere.In the beginning Andy really had bad luck. To have your wife being killed at the moment you found out she had an affair. It's was also really unfortunate that he was near the crime scene with a gun. He seemed guilty. His first years in the prison were also very hard for Andy. At the moment he's doing better, I felt better. Then the story continues to have an unexpected turn. The better Andy's life was going, the better I was feeling. I was very glad to see there was justice in the end."
4623,True,"The acting may have been better than the acting in the original. Robert De Niro gave a perfect subtle performance as Vito Corleone. His portrayal was powerful and breathtaking. When I think De Niro I definitely do not think subtle and smooth but that is exactly what he was in here. It is definitely one of his top three performances in his career. The depth in his portrayal was able to justify the Vito Corleone that Marlon Brando portrayed in the first. Al Pacino gave a very strong performance playing Michael Corleone. In here we get to see more of the tough decisions that have to be made and the consequences of certain actions. Al Pacino perfectly displayed the amount of thought and struggle that goes into and comes out of every action you make; the way it affects relationships, family, power and influence. Diane Keaton was not really given a lot of room to act in the first but in here she is very good. She did not play the stereotypical wife who always stands behind her husband but rather the woman with a mind of her own who is willing to go after what she feels she deserves. Robert Duvall again to me was the glue to the movie. Just having him in there kind of makes you feel safe. John Cazale also had more of an impact in here than in the first playing the half-witted brother always needing to be bailed out. A lot of these characters sound so familiar and stereotypical but in The Godfather Part II every character is played out with such extraordinary depth. Everyone from Talia Shire who gave a fine performance to Lee Strasberg all the way down to the kid who played young Vito Corleone were perfect. Part II seems to me to be more of a character study than the original."
4624,True,Best movie ever you need time to watch it..But true.. Everything.. Life.. More or less is like this.This will be always a true mafia Sicilian store We need more films like this..Thank you. More or less what they think. Is what enemies thinks.You have to be always waiting the worst of everyone.Tale care of your family.Thts the Thanks again for making this movie reflection.The acting of everyone are perfect Marlon incredible And all the rest i think it make everyone carrere grow so up they didn't imagine
4625,True,"The story begins as ""Don"" Vito Corleone, the head of a New York Mafia ""family"", oversees his daughter's wedding with his wife Carmela. His beloved son Michael has just come home from the war, but does not intend to become part of his father's business. Through Michael's life the nature of the family business becomes clear. The business of the family is just like the head of the family, kind and benevolent to those who give respect, but given to ruthless violence whenever anything stands against the good of the family. Don Vito lives his life in the way of the old country, but times are changing and some don't want to follow the old ways and look out for community and ""family"". An up and coming rival of the Corleone family wants to start selling drugs in New York, and needs the Don's influence to further his plan. The clash of the Don's fading old world values and the new ways will demand a terrible price, especially from Michael, all for the sake of the family. - Written by Charlie Ness"
4626,True,"A masterpiece of work, off all actors and the director Francis Ford Coppola. In this first part you see how a crime family runs their business and how the head of the crime family have to deal with lots of complications with other crime family's in new york, with the police, with his sons and daughter. Marlon Brando plays a very dark head of the crime family. Together with Al Pacino James Caan and Robert Duvall who also play awesome, Its a must to see if you like crime movies. If you ain't see this movie, you ain't see any other movie. Also the music in the movie is really well chosen, it has something scary and at the same time it feels like heaven. Just watch it. cant tell what happens in the movie, because then i have to make a review of 2000 pages i think."
4627,True,"The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap- operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl."
4628,True,i think it is the best movie.I have never seen a movie like this.it had great scene and powerful acting also it show us the realistic history of the USA.on the other hand the music of the godfather is amazing.i think everybody should listen it because when you listen the that music you feel very interesting feelings and you feel you acting in the movie like an actor.finally i am asking to all people please make great time to watch this movie if you don't you never understand this amazing movie.( when you watch this film you will feel many thing about the best movie .
4629,True,"Because it opens with a wedding, each new viewing of ""The Godfather"" feels like a happy reunion with familiar characters. And each time it is bittersweet because we know what will happen to all of them in the end. But there are seemingly endless new details to uncover, and film writers have provided a steady stream of new interpretations to consider. Count the times that doors close on women, shutting them out of the macho world of the cosa nostra¬óa phone booth door, a bathroom door, a study door. Notice, as writer Pablo Villa√ßa does, how the color of Kay's clothes change from bright red to dull beige as she gets pulled further into Michael's toxic orbit. Look at the way Vito Corleone and Tom Hagen reflexively touch their faces, cuffs, and collars after difficult conversations, a nervous tic that Michael, in his coldness, does not seem to share, and which seems significant only because everything in this dense production seems purposeful and meaningful. Consider, like historian Bruce Schulman, whether Michael¬óan American war hero with an American girlfriend who ultimately cannot escape his Sicilian roots¬óis a metaphor for failed cultural assimilation. Maybe some of these observations are stretches, the products of our obsessive love for a movie that director Francis Ford Coppola reportedly considers a studio film and that Orson Welles called ""the glorification of a bunch of bums who never existed."" There's some truth in those criticisms, just as there is truth in the paeans and the deep analyses. Maybe there's no such thing as a perfect movie. But ""The Godfather"" looks, sounds, and feels very, very close, even the Nth time around."
4630,True,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" truly qualifies as the ""Gone with the Wind"" of gangster movies. The first installment in the Oscar-winning trilogy covers decades, mob wars, romances, intrigue, and treachery. Specifically, ""The Godfather"" received three Oscars. First, it was voted Best Picture; the Academy recognized Marlon Brando as Best Actor, and Coppola shares a Best Writing statuttee with Mario Puzo. Clocking in at a robust 175 minutes, ""The Godfather"" cast Brando as the seasoned Don Vito Corleone, with Al Pacino elbowing his way right behind him as the youngest son Michael. James Caan makes a lot of fuss as Pacino's older brother Sonny, and the ever dependable Robert Duval is cast as the consigliere for the family. Interestingly, Caan, Duval, and Pacino all competed for Best Supporting Actor, and Coppola was up for Best Director. Dean Tavoularis' production designs, Warren Clymer's art direction, and Philip Smith's set decoration are all sumptuous. The best scenes include Michael's massacre at the restaurant, Carlo and his wife smashing dishes, Sonny's ambush in the causeway, Brando's death scene in the tomato patch, and the finale with the elimination of all of Michael's enemies. The screenplay deserved an Oscar. The least shall be first as Michael demonstrates during his meteoric rise to power. The dialogue contains quotable lines and several interesting characters who aren't relatives of the Corleone clan. Gordon Willis' shadowy, straight-on photography captures the treachery of the crime syndicate. Of course, ""The Godfather, Part II"" surpasses it in every respect, and it deserved the six Oscars that it garnered."
4631,True,"One of the best films ever. After winning an Oscar for Patton, Francis Ford Coppola became notable in Hollywood. The Godfather, Francis Ford's masterpiece, places him on the map as a respectable director. The direction was great by Coppola and the adapted screenplay by Coppola and Puzo was amazing. The wedding scene in the beginning introduces the characters and shows their importance.Don Vito Correlone (Brando) is by far the most respected character in this movie. This is shown in the beginning during the wedding of his daughter when follow Sicilian?s pay their respects to him and asking for favors. Vito shows a moral life when he feels disrespected when a family friend decided to go to the police first. He also shows moral when he is against drugs because it's a crime with victims.Michael Corelone (Pacino) who is Don Vito's youngest son seems to be a nice and noble kid especially when he is treated like a war hero and seem to be a protagonist. Michael seems to not be interested to be a part of the ""business"" but later on it seems like he was force to. Towards the end of the film when Michael lies to his sister and wife and closes door on his wife it seemed like it was the beginning of a new villain within Michael.Sonny (Caan) who is Don Vito's eldest son seems to be the next Don. However, he has his flaws especially being known as short-tempered and eager. He flaws would soon affect him and the chances of becoming the next Don.The middle child which seems to be the least important one is Fredo. Fredo (Cazale) is the child that seems not to gain any respect from anyone within the family. He is also known as the ""weak"" one within the family.Tom Hagen (Duvall) who is the Don's adopted son is the right hand man for the family and he is the brains for them with all of the connections.The only daughter in the family is Connie (Shire), she is nice and tired of the mafia life and she is extremely gullible. She marries an abusive person but is gullible enough to stay with him and defend him.Kay (Keaton) who is Michael's girlfriend gets pushed around starting when Michael says he would never get involved with his families work but as we all know this isn't true. Michael's work for the family slowly tears apart his relationship with Kay. The ending of the film can easily be considered the greatest with Michael becoming the ""Godfather"" in two different ways.This movie shows the life of a Mafia man, the scary and painful times. The acting by the whole cast with the likes of Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Cazale, Keaton, and Shire was amazing and was one the best of performances by them in their careers. Brando himself put up one of the greatest performances by an actor ever. Pacino has his best performance in his career which also starts it off."
4632,True,"The Godfather is a beautifully written piece about the inner workings of a mob family between 1945 and 1955. The main storyline is about a mob Don, Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando, and his two sons, Sonny and Michael, played by James Caan and Al Pacino respectively. Michael starts out as an outsider, with no interest in joining the ""family business."" The ""family business"" is a term that is used frequently and carries heavy significance. Whenever they talk ""business,"" they often use the phrase, ""It's not personal, it's just business."" They use it to convince not only society and the surrounding people but also themselves that what they are doing isn't as violent as it actually is. Using the family business ideal and constantly reminding themselves that what they are doing is business, not extortion, racketeering, and murder, helps them to cope with the violence and the guilt that comes with such activities. I think that one of the things that helps this movie along profusely is the acting of the mob members. The transformation of Michael portrayed by Al Pacino is the reason that this movie works. Michael starts out as a college kid with a girlfriend who wants nothing to do with the family business. He shows respect to his family, but declines interest in the illegal aspect of their business ventures. Once things start spiraling out of control, he proudly steps into any role they need him to fulfill, even if it means he has to leave the country for a few years. Once he returns, he continues to develop into a leader, with the calm contentions of his father and the intelligence and youth of a new generation, all the way until he replaces Vito as the Don of the Corleone family.Coppola uses doors as a symbol of the clear separation between the men's ""family business"" and the women's family business. Whenever the men are about to discuss their ventures, they close the door to the outside world, both for security purposes and because they are the only ones who have the authority to make those decisions. While the men talk about that business, the women cook, clean, and tend to the younger children, clearly separated from the men's work, usually by a door.The biggest key to being an effective don in a mob is being respectful. In the meeting of the five families, Don Vito swears on his grandchildren's life that he will not break the peace they have decided upon, and hugs the don who had his son killed. Seeing those two men hug even after they had each other's sons killed clearly indicates that respect is something that is vital in this criminal underworld. One of the big moments in the movie is when Michael decides to do whatever is necessary for the family by agreeing to shoot Sollozzo in the diner. Michael changes his beliefs toward the family business in order to help his family. Later when their sister calls Sonny and says she's been beaten again, he rushes out the door without taking any bodyguards with him in order to protect and defend her. Later when the Corleone family is trying to buy the casino in Las Vegas, they ask Johnny Fontane to sign a contract to help their business, and he signs it without a second thought, because they are like family. Seeing these acts of family loyalty makes it clear that family is the one thing that people of this time believe in above all else.One of the best things about the Godfather is since it was an ensemble movie with many stars and lead characters, there is a constant fear for the characters safety. In some movies, there are only one or two main characters, so you know that they aren't in any harm or real danger until the end of the movie, and even then rarely. In The Godfather, several of the Corleone family members, rival members, and family friends die throughout the movie, even some of the big stars. Don Vito gets shot, survives, and then suffers a fatal heart attack later. Sonny gets gunned down in the street by a rival family. A supposed family friend, Sal Tessio, tried to set up Michael in a deal with the Barzini family, and they kill him. Seeing important named characters die throughout the movie makes it seem more realistic and more fearful of any dangerous situation they talk about.The biggest underlying struggle throughout the entire film is corruption versus loyalty and trying to make the best choices for the long term that will benefit you and that you can be at peace with. Corruption of loyalties, business matters, and family is rampant throughout the film. Sal Tessio gets paid by Barzini to try and get Michael killed. Carlo, Corinne's husband, baited Sonny into the open so Barzini's men could gun him down. Even the Corleones are guilty of using corruption to their advantage: They murder and mutilate the prized horse of a filmmaker so Johnny Fontane can get a part in a movie. The internal struggle of each character trying to stay devoted to their family while staying on top in the business is enticing to be a part of for a few hours."
4633,True,"Now I have seen 'THE GODFATHER' and its sequels a number of times and can even recite the dialog of whole scenes word for word. I took my father to see it on his birthday back in the seventies, because I thought he would get a kick out of seeing someone who, like himself didn't speak much, but when he did, made it count. I think he fell asleep here and there during the film, but then, he was just a man holding down a full time job and taking care of his family.I remember first reading the novel, which I rated as a cultural curiosity somewhere in quality between 'THE DAY OF THE JACKAL' and 'MANDINGO'. The film we enjoyed because of Brando's at that time offbeat performance and the strong ensemble cast. When I went to see 'NOTHING BUT A MAN' with my friend Donald Mack, besides him commenting to me, ""-this ain't no movie, this is real-"", I remember Ivan Dixon telling Gloria Foster in the movie that he was turning out to be just like his father. The manner in which Al Pacino portrays Michael Corleone you see this process of transformation rather than hear the character tell of it. Though in the original screenplay that I was fortunate to read recently, Michael does indeed tell his father, ""-and now I'm just like you.""Francis Ford Coppola has made many interesting statements about this unlikely and serendipitous masterpiece he has wrought. Some of the reviewers have compared it to 'DEATH OF A SALESMAN' complete with a spaghetti dinner, and Coppola himself once compared Don Vito Corelone to King Lear, a man whose void will be hard to fill ere his Kingdom is to be kept from collapsing. Michael, as we come to discover, has the cold Machiavellian cunning, Santino has the muscular viciousness, Fredo the sweetness of a kindly sense of compassion, and Tom as the adopted son the calm deliberation for moderation, and yet not one of these individuals has all these attributes so harmoniously blended into their personality as the Don himself.And who is this Don Vito Coreleone? A man alone with his own thoughts who well realizes he could have been more than he is given an uplifting childhood environment and better circumstances. A natural leader who is even something of a statesman to hear Mario Puzo tell it in his novel, who yet and still played by Brando is a walking shell of a man able to offer his family nothing beyond their material success other than an incremental spiritual decay. Should you doubt this, review the endings of 'THE GODFATHER-II' and 'THE GODFATHER-III again. Now that I look back on it, I don't believe 'THE GODFATHER' would have become the success it is today were someone else to have acted Brando's role. There is an intelligence and a liveliness to all the portrayals from Diane Keaton to Robert Duvall to James Caan and others, but there is something haunting and understated about Brando's performance in this film that speaks to the mystery of unfulfilled human potential. Of all the performances that I revisit in this movie from time to time his is the only one that seems to have grown in stature over the years. Sure, I understand better now what a tight spot Michael was in with the death of Santino, and now sitting at his father's funeral, watching Barzini shake hands with his colleagues as though he were the heir apparent, he realizes that he is just the next item to be checked off on the list in a power struggle he inherited more than signed up to fight. That is, unless like Telemachos, he can carry out the plan he and his father designed before Don Vito went off to his grave.I know my girlfriend at the time felt cheated and disappointed with Brando's performance. She wanted more of Stanley Kowalski's animal vitality or the roaring declaiming of Brando as Mark Anthony in 'JULIUS CAESAR'! But I understood, even though I was not at first viscerally affected by it so much, what Brando was doing. The acting that Brando does in 'THE GODFATHER' is the acting of personal presence altitude. The power of his portrayal comes not from what he says or does, but from what he doesn't say or does. It is an understated performance that evokes and causes you to add your own connotations to what he is doing. Here is a self made man who somehow worked himself through material success from something to nothing and is puzzling to himself how he got there, but he is not going to let you see him doing it.I know and have read how Pacino and many others thought he should have been nominated for Best Actor honors along with Marlon Brando and whether he should have or not is more than I know. All I do know is that there were times when the action got hot and furious, and that I was tensely waiting for Don Vito Corelone to appear again, not say or do anything particularly, just appear, and somehow by just appearing stabilize the narrative and bring some kind of sense and order to his surroundings. There are people like that, you know. I remember when I would watch 'Young Abe Lincoln' there was a point in the story where Lincoln played by Henry Fonda would not be physically in the scene, and yet you could feel his shadow over the entire proceedings. Brando's Don Vito Corelone is the moral inversion of all of this. When he lays his plans with his son Michael, you glimpse the roles that Brando could have played; Socrates, Ernest Hemingway, and even Black Elk. The roles of idealism that James Coburn berated him for not playing. And who can say there wasn't time, there just wasn't time?"
4634,True,"One of the most seen movies of all time. Very few are those who haven't seen it or those who don't value it. The Godfather came to life in 1972 by the hands of Francis Ford Coppola transferring Mario Puzo's novel into the screen. It stars Marlon Brando (Don Corleone), Al Pacino (Michael Corleone), Diane Keaton (Kay), between others. The plot describes one of the five families of organised crime in New York around the late 40s and the first half of the 50s, the Corleones, more specifically the transition of power from Don Corleone to his son, Michael. Marlon Brando has one of the best performances I've seen, if not the best. It's amazing how he managed to incorporate the old gangster. Many people appreciate more his way of talking, this is not what makes it unique though, try to notice his facial expressions and you'll see it. Al Pacino also comes in great form but falls to second layout because of Brando's marvel. Coppola confines himself to the family and mixes it with the sheer and simple life that gangsters try to attach to their family, but many times fail to. Godfather is a great movie, probably the best related to mafia you've seen and will ever see, with many other unsuccessfully attempts movies (though strangely over-rated) such as Scarface, but that is a whole different story."
4635,True,"The gangster is the unacceptable face of the American myth. He is the antithesis of the western hero; he is not society's saviour but its public enemy. The 1930's gangster film was rooted in headlines of the day; it was a resolutely contemporary genre. The first gangster cycle responded to the restrictions of Prohibition and the effects of the Depression. These gangsters defied harsh economic realities and in doing so became anti-heroes of the people. Their defiance of authority made them relevant and popular; they were the dark side of the American dream.In the first cycle of gangster films, the criminals were positioned as alien to the WASP norm. These Italian and Irish gangsters were separated by their ethnicity. The Hays Code soon came in to try and combat these films. It forbade the vilification of ethnic groups and banned films focusing on criminal behaviour. This shifted emphasis to law enforcers. It was hard therefore to truly make gangster films. The genre was pushed to the margins and remained out with the mainstream for a long time. In the late 60's Bonnie and Clyde changed all this. Its mix of violence, New Hollywood style, anti-authoritarian stance and counter-culture relevance brought the gangster film right up to date. The scene was set for The Godfather.Francis Ford Coppola's film was the first epic gangster film. It made it a durable genre. But it was significantly different to the 30's gangster movies like The Public Enemy. It was not a rise and fall narrative. Don Vito Corleone begins the film at the height of his powers and dies peacefully while playing with his grandson; he does not die in the gutter. Neither does he exhibit the brash over-reaching arrogance that typified the 30's gangsters. He treats his position within the community as a responsibility and he has moral limits. The film does not end with the fall of the crime family; it climaxes with Michael Corleone at the absolute peak of his powers. The changes to censorship now allowed for a narrative to focus on criminals, in the case of The Godfather it went as far as virtually eliminating every other point-of-view; in this film people out with the crime family are the aliens. Where the 30's gangsters were at odds with society, the gangster here is the power structure. The Corleones are the good bad guys. When this film was made Vietnam had destroyed the certainties Americans had about their country. The Godfather seemed to say if American society is rotten, organised crime is only part of the problem, sometimes the solution.The film stressed the universal theme of loyalty to the family. This helped cloak its critique of American society in a conservative framework. It not only put the gangster back in the centre of film narrative but it also stressed ethnicity in a positive way. They were no longer apart but important members of the establishment. The law enforcers depicted here are more corrupt. They act in a criminal way but without any moral code. In many ways it is a transgressive film.Acting is great across the board. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall stand out particularly in a true heavyweight cast. The story unfolds beautifully with a fantastic script to propel it. Coppola holds the whole thing together with some brilliance. He doesn't really do anything fancy but just lets all the superlative components at his disposal do their thing and ensures they all connect together into a film of huge class. The Godfather is a masterwork and remains a primary reason why the era of the New Hollywood will always be cherished."
4636,True,"Where do I start, I shall start with the script. First of all it is flawless. Vito Corleone is being forced to start dealing in drugs from another family. He decides drugs is a dirty business. Then he finds out it's a bad idea because he gets shot... don't worry he didn't die.. not yet anyway. Michael his son decides to take care of him while he is the hospital..this in turn leads Michael to decide he wants to be part of the family business. He gets a sucker punch from a crooked cop. That leads to him being mad so the family want revenge. He meets them at a restaurant and for those of you who have seen the film.. you know what happens. Anyway Michael goes into hiding in Italy.. he then comes back years later and marries his old sweat heart Kay. He is now the boss of the family.That tells you a lot about the plot but I think it is necessary to let you know what you are in for if you want to know about this film. I will now tell you about the cinematography it is gorgeous views on location in Italy out in the country.. also the look in new york all dark and sinister is great feel for the film.. I also love when they go to Las Vegas near the end and Michael wants to get a gaming license in Nevada. This is historically accurate in a sense that the mob made Las Vegas what you see today (the vision came from Bugsy Siegel.Now the music is the most amazing score I have ever come across in my life.. it is just fantastic.. You just have to watch the film to experience to this whole arc of family, loyalty and greed is one of the best portraits of the mafia you will ever see. In all this is a great film about family and how you can't get out of anything you love.. because once your in the mob there is no way out except you know what I love this film I rank it number 3 on my all time list.. and I just love it.. In fact I might go and watch it right now"
4637,True,"well i wont be the only one who has given 10 to the godfather. i consider it as the greatest movie in the world. performance by Marlon Brando is far too better than what it was in on the waterfront.also the co-actors had worked really well...of course i need not to tell anything about the class acting of AL pacino. though the Oscar was achieved by sir Marlon Brando but the versatility was more in AL pacino's character.the movie ain't that unfair also...i mean it has given more beauty than what it was in the book. especially the character of Vito and sonny corleone are giving a different identity(good identity) so by which if somebody reads it after the movie then they would keep imaging the moviethe best thing about the movie is they have not left a character unsatisfying. also the story has a normal speed to go and it doesn't bore you in any middle. one must admit that the godfather wouldn't have been what it is without the beautiful direction by Francis f Coppola. also nino Rita has given never forgetting music in the movie which is still today in my ears...in all the godfather is a classic movie which not anyone can ever make again and its all the good magic by the director, Marlon Brando and AL pacino...... 'f**k you if u don like it'."
4638,True,"This has got to be the single greatest film ever made, the attention given to detail, to acting, to the cinematography, to the overall setting in such a short time was amazing.Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the Corleone crime family and when he is made an offer by a narcotics dealer Virgil Sollozzo (Al Lettieri). He refuses, however his eldest son Sonny (James Caan) shows some interest in the Narcotics trade, giving Sollozzo and 2 other mob families the opening to take out the Don and make the offer to Sonny, the assassination happens, however Vito lives and it is getting close to a mob war, however Michael (Al Pacino) Vito's youngest son says that he is ready to have a meeting with Sollozzo and the crooked cop that is protecting him Captain McClusky (Sterling Hayden) which ends up with Mike killing both the cop and the narcotics dealer, with Michael feeling to Sicily a mob war occurs leading us to some tragic and harsh events.There are a lot of sub-plots, details and major characters that i left out but i was explaining the starting point of this classic.The film is a portrait on family, the general state of America and the entire point of the character Michael Corleone, the people that claim that The Godfather is not an accurate depiction of the mob did not get the point of the film, this film changed the way films were made, before The Godfather you had to be a Bogart or a Wayne but after this masterpiece the names Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro could star in major motion pictures of a mammoth scale like The Godfather.It is not only a visual feast it is also the perfect film as the only things wrong with the film were continuation errors, the acting and everything is up to perfect, Francis Ford's directing was one of the best directorial efforts ever.This film made a lot of stars packed with some of the greatest acting performances ever given (Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan etc).10 out of 10 from me."
4639,True,"*****Spoilers Ahead***** 'The Godfather' is a film that everyone knows about. It is the type of film that is so heavily ingrained within popular culture that every reference, parody, and outright copy is almost a culture unto itself. It is because of this that even if you have not had the pleasure of viewing Francis Ford Coppola's master work, you feel like you have. It is also because of this that a surprising number of people never get around to watching 'The Godfather'. Afraid that they'll be entering a world of endless Mafia clich√© and hackneyed dialogue, they steer clear of this gem of a film. A few days ago I was one of those people. Now - after picking up the box set for the meagre sum of fifteen pounds ¬ñ I would count myself as one of the lucky portion of the population who has seen 'The Godfather'.For the uninformed the story of 'The Godfather' is, on the surface, simple gangster fare. The film, set in the late forties, follows the trials and tribulations of the Corleone family ¬ñ one of five mobs in New York ¬ñ as they try to stay on top as the supreme power in the city. What actually comes is a complex tale which carries weighty themes such as the corruption of innocence, the loss of the American Dream, and the cyclical nature of a life in crime.What struck me most about 'The Godfather' was how sedate it was when compared with other pieces of cinema. A few nights before, I watched 'City of God', a film about child gangs in Rio De Janeiro. This film, although slick and well presented, ultimately didn't leave much room for reflection on what is a very heavy and ugly subject; It left me feeling cold. It tried to point out the horrific state that Brazilian slums were in, but was so desperate to look good that it almost missed its own point.In stark contrast, 'The Godfather' is nothing if not thoughtful. Every scene, although well directed, never tries to point out its own style in any kind of pronounced manner. This could be more to do with older directorial styles but it still stands out. In a time when films revolving around gangs are nothing but frenetic gun-toting festivals of violence, blood, guts, and vague subtexts, it is refreshing to see a film that presents its concepts and central themes in a way that allows the viewer to actually digest them. Any on-screen violence that does happen is necessary to move the plot forward and is exactly the way cinema violence should be ¬ñ blunt, seemingly real, and uncomfortable to watch. It is as though the film has sat you down and said ""This violence here. You see that? Pretty nasty huh? You don't want to see it again, do you? No? Good. Now listen to what we have to say about the flawed nature of the American Dream."" It actively makes you despise the brutality of a life in crime by making it feel relentlessly vicious.This is illustrated in one scene involving family member Michael in a caf√©. His task is to kill the two men opposite him. A train can be heard outside. As the noise of the train becomes louder and louder we see Michaels hand in his pocket, desperately toying with the gun. His face is tense and sweating profusely. The train grows louder and louder still, its cacophony overwhelming to the viewer, and you can feel the tension that must be welling up inside of Michael until he eventually pulls the trigger in what turns out to be a fairly botched assassination. Not only does this type of abhorrence to violence help make you acutely aware of the horrid nature of the 'family business' but it also drives Michaels story along as he becomes more desensitised to this type of brutality whilst he climbs the ranks of his business before becoming the patriarchal figure that he had, at one time, no desire to be. By the end of the film, a killing is nothing in the eyes of what was once an honest American citizen with unfortunate family ties.I mentioned in the opening paragraph that 'The Godfather' is a film that is referenced so much that it is easy to pass it by whilst still somehow feeling like you've watched it. Although you still kind of get that feeling on viewing, it feels more like a welcoming friend than a clich√© ridden hammy mess. From the iconic music to the infamous line ""We'll make him an offer he can't refuse"", from the horses head in the bed to badda bing badda boom. No matter how many parodies of 'The Godfather' you may have seen - and there are a lot of them ¬ñ these moments that we all know of never detract from a full viewing. When everything is in context and being performed by an astonishingly good cast you forget about every other crappy gangster film you've ever seen and just get sucked straight in.In conclusion, watch this film. No matter who you are or what films you usually like, watch this one. Even if you don't enjoy it, it's worth just experiencing such a beautifully made film. If you can pick up the Coppola restoration then it's even better to look at. Do it now. Watch it!"
4640,True,"The Godfather, there is so much to say about this movie, I mean it is incredible from beginning to end, taking you along as the main character, makes a change from a passive man to someone who has to step up and choose to do things against his nature for the good of his family. Marlon Brando is amazing in this movie as the Don, the head of the family, AL Pacino who takes over the movie deserved and Oscar for this movie not just a nomination, with a supporting cast that is phenomenal, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall etc.. The amazing part of this movie is after Marlon Brando's is almost killed and Michael makes the decision to take out Sollozo and and the captain for what tried to do to his father, after that scene Michael is never the same he realizes what he has to become and has to do to take care of his family. This movie deserves to be #1 on this site and everywhere, this is just my opinion."
4641,True,"I have no idea how a movie can be better than this! This is doubtlessly the greatest film ever made, i mean.. its just perfection. From acting, to story to the 1940's set pieces, this film dominates all films. Comon everyone have to admit Marlon Brando's performance in this film is one of the greatest performance ever in the film history. By the way the score is another element that adds to the greatness of this film, The only word to describe this film is 'EPIC' All characters fit in perfectly, the mood/tone is correct for every scene and all actors equally shows their talent fully in this film. The memorable moments such as the Don shooting scene, Sollozzo killing scene! concludes this film to be pure perfection! Words can't explain his movie and if u haven't seen it am telling ya u r missing out a big part of your life!"
4642,True,"I see this outstanding film for the 3rd time in my life..and it's totally PERFECTION..i can't say this film is my favorite of all time..i really can't..but my favorite actor is definitely Marlon Brando..Like Jack Nicholson said..""We All Brando's Children's""..and he RIGHT..i think only him can make this character of ""The Godfather"" so Totally Amazing.. no one can make it better then him..After all..his Performance was PERFECT!! and Al Pacino also..PERFECT!! those guys are the Top Class actors of all Generatinos without shadow of a doubt..there's such a lot of moments than you will never forget at this POWERFUL Film..it Should be No. 1 at the Top 250. Definitely.Last movies seen..L.A Confidential (1997) - 10/10. Five Easy Pieces (1970) - 8.5/10. The Treasure Of Sierra Madre (1948) - 10/10. The Shining (1980) - 10/10.

4643,True,"I don't know how many times I've seen this film, but it's one of those movies I can just sit down and watch again & again. Even though I know what's going to happen in every scene, it just keeps my attention every time I see it. The acting is outstanding, the story line is very well written, and it just has all those moments that, even though you've seen the movie before, you want to see them again. Like, for instance, when the movie mogul wakes up to find his prized horse's head in his bed. Just thinking of the horror of that actually happening to someone, you know he's not going to go against the Godfather's wishes. And the moment Michael pulls the trigger to kill the drug kingpin and the police captain which means he is no longer an innocent bystander and is fully ""in."" This movie has so many mini-climaxes like this which eventually lead to the finale in which Michael rises to the top.The best thing about this movie is that it never gets old. It will never be outdated, since it's set in the 40's, so it's a timeless classic.This is without a doubt the best mob film ever."
4644,True,"This is one of my favorite movies. However, the last time I saw it, I was disappointed to spot a serious flaw in the plot that I never realized before. It seems that not many people have. The movie is still so great, that this blunder is forgivable. But, at least for me, it will never be the same again. If you read any further, you may be as disappointed as I was.When Michael decides to try and kill Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey, he assumes that the three will be alone in a restaurant without further protection from the Sollozzo family, so Michael will be able to walk away after shooting them down. This assumption is completely unfounded; for all the Corleones know, the place could have been packed with Sollozzo men. The whole plan revolves around the idea that they will be able to find out the place of the meeting in advance, which was to be unilaterally chosen by the enemy. Well, in the event, the Corleones do find the name of the restaurant. They still assume their victims will have no protection, and now they know where the three will be. What could be easier than sending a couple of men there to do the deed, instead of planting the gun for the inexperienced Michael, which is patently a riskier approach? No group of thugs would have overlooked this. In the movie, the option is not even mentioned."
4645,True,"Rated R for Strong Violence,Sexual Content and Some Language. Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:18AThe Godfather is the number 1 movie on IMDb's Top 250 movies list.It won best picture at the academy awards.It has been praised by critics and it spawned two sequels.I don't think it should be the number 1 movie in the Top 250(dont ask me what should because I am not really sure) but Godfather is a very amazing movie and its definitely in my Top 10 movie list.This is one of the first and greatest mafia movies ever made.It has excellent acting, an excellent storyline, it is a great adaptation of a great book, it has an all star cast of Marlon Brando,Al Pacino,James Caan,Robert Duvall,Talia Shire,Diane Keaton and others.I can see why some people may not like it.I can see it being boring for some people but I find it one of the few long movies that keep me interested until the end.The movie is about a mafia don, who gets shot and this sparks a war between the five mafia families of new york.Their son Michael(Al Pacino) is an army veteran who does not want to get involved in the family business but ends up being the don(sorry about the spoiler).The movie has a great ending as well.This movie was fairly violent for 1972 but is tame by today's standards.In conclusion the godfather is an excellent mafia movie but it is a little overrated.Godfather Part 2 is almost as good, Part 3 is not as good as the first two but still good despite what most think."
4646,True,"The Godfather has been timelessly voted the best movie ever, over and over and over again, but its not!!!! However, do not let this opinionated view fool you, it is a fantastic film with nothing wrong with it. This films ranks up with the other most over rated films in existence, such as Star wars: a new hope and Apocalypse now.The films starts off at a wedding, the daughter of the infamous 'Godfather' is getting married, and we soon find out that on this day of all days, no father can refuse a request. More subplots follow and some interesting dialog is put forward, until the Godfather is gunned down by a rival family. However, he does not die but is in injured, along the way his son dies, and the son of the man who tried to kill him dies. The Godfathers youngest son Michael has to flee the country as he is the one who killed the rival family members son, The godfather is upset as he wanted Michael to be the legitimate member of the family. The plot goes by and Michael returns, and along with the Godfather they kill all the head members of the leading rival families. This is not the best plot summary in the world but it will do.The film is flawless, as many people constantly state. The acting is great, although Brando should not have won a best actor Oscar? All the other 3 should not have even been nominated for best supporting actors and actresses. But besides this, the give great performances. The script is where most of the talents truly lie, a brilliant story of the Mafia and how it operates, filled with loyalty and betrail this is a film which takes you on an intense and emotional ride. But this film is very very boring in some places, for instance when Michael is hiding out in Italy. Now im no shallow person who has to have action and explosions in movies to feel satisfied, but for a film to be crowned the greatest ever you have to love every bit of the film completely, and everyone will admit there are very boring bits in this. However still a great film. In my opinion, if you really want to a crown a film the best ever, you should look to titles such as Terminator 2, Shawshank Redemption, Master and Commander: The far side of the world, Lord of the rings trilogy"
4647,True,"THE GODFATHER is an example of how stories change over the years. In Washington Irving's LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW, we had the headless horseman. In Mario Puzo's GODFATHER, we had the headless horse.In all seriousness, there is only one other movie I have given a perfect 10 to so far, and that's TORA TORA TORA. It took me a while to appreciate this movie. The first time I saw GODFATHER, I saw more blood and gore than I remember ever seeing in any movie before, though it's pretty tame by today's standards. My mind wandered quite a bit during it and I came out of there kind of glad it was over. Then, several months later, I heard the soundtrack and I liked it so much, I thought I would give this movie another chance. It has come to be my all time favorite movie. And the music is still great. The mellow, folklike soundtrack provides a nice balance to the violence that goes on throughout the movie.Francis Ford Coppola is faithful to the book and tells the story very well. Watching the way certain scenes are set up is like watching the workings of a fine Swiss watch, it is that good. It gives depth and insight into the workings of the Mafia that no other movie before or since ever has. The point of view this story is told in is controversial, ie, they give you possible justifications for some of the things they do, and it almost makes you sympathize with the characters. The most telling lines in the story is when Michael comes back after hiding out in Sicily for the murder of a police officer and a bigshot in a rival family. He is talking to Kay, telling her he has decided to go into business with his father, and tells her that his father is no different than anyone else who is responsible for people's welfare, like a Congressman or President. Kay states that is naive because Congressmen and Presidents don't have people killed. Michael then fixes her with that patented stare (Al Pacino was perfect in this role) and says, ""Who's being naive, Kay?"" That is a very chilling moment, as is Michael's transformation from wholesome American war hero to the head of one of the most powerful Mafia families in the country. Another telling moment is when Michael meets with his father in the garden and they are discussing business strategies, and the Don says, ""I don't apologize for my life. I did what I had to to protect my family, and I refused to be a fool for those pezzanovante who were holding the strings."" In conclusion, you will have a tough time convincing me that there is a Mafia movie anywhere that is better than THE GODFATHER. 10 out of 10."
4648,True,"I was always embarrassed to confess that I hadn't seen the Godfather trilogy. So last night I finally saw the part one of the Corleone family saga. The film was as brilliant as I had expected, and more.""The Godfather"" thrills right to the core of the world of Italian-American (gangster) families after the second World War. In the year 1946 the Corleone family has a powerful position in the under world. The family's head don Vito Corleone (just amazing Marlon Brando) has connections and relations in politics, police forces etc. But he also has enemies. There is also four other families wanting to have as much power as they can get. The first big trouble emerges when don Vito refuses to take part in narcotic-business. There is conspiracy and vengeance bubbling underneath.One of the most fascinating themes in the movie is Corleone's youngest son's (Al Pacino) struggle of being part of the gangster family. Don Vito does not want Michael to involve family business but the blood is thicker than wine. Michael says he is not going to become like his father but in time he will realize that his destiny is to become the Godfather.Francis Ford Coppola's magnificent directing and amazing script of the author Mario Puzo makes ""The Godfather"" very enjoyable and thrilling to watch. Also the talented cast (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall etc.)is like a cherry on the top of delicious ice-cream portion.The film is really capturing. Almost three hours long movie didn't felt so long at all. After watching the film I sure was thirsty for more!"
4649,True,"For the first time in my life, I was blessed able to watch this masterpiece. The film has aged well since it was released and I was very impressed.This film is about the Corleone crime family and their struggles with the other crime families.This is Marlon Brando's best film in my opinion, and every actor and actress does a fabulous job.The film is rather long, so make sure you have plenty of time on your hands to watch it. It took me a few days to watch it, but I was recovering from surgery, so I could only watch a little bit at a time."
4650,True,"People can tell lots of things about this movie, but this movie teaches something that nobody doesn't notice really. It is about being a man. What is being a man? First, it is loving your family and depend on them. You always protect them from every dangerous situation, and it doesn't matter how to do. You can do it legally or illegally. Second thing is always being calm and strong-minded. If you are calm and strong-minded, you will be able to protect your family. This movie teaches people it. You must watch this movie if you never watched it before. If you watched it before, you must watch it again and again, so you can understand the thought of this movie."
4651,True,"I watched this movie recently, and i am disappointed. I was expecting masterpiece, i was wrong. It is on the top, but i think it is highly overrated. The Godfather is definitely too long, some parts are absurd, like final scene when Mike tells his wife that he didn't kill his brother-in-law, and she believes him!!!!!! I was laughing and this is not a comedy. Music is bad, too many useless scenes. The Godfather is a good movie, but not brilliant, as many think. There are many better movies like: The Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Lord of the Rings(1,2,3), Fight Club, etc. When you like crime movies so better watch: Goodfellas, LA Confidential, Once Upon a Time in America.Still i must admit Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone was GREAT!!!!!!!!!!Worth seeing 6/10, not a masterpiece."
4652,True,"How can you doubt it? From the very moment the picture started, I had goosebumps. Marlon Brando gives an excellent Oscar winning performance, that I can't imagine anyone else playing Don Vito Corleone. Not to mention its Oscar nominated actors in supporting roles, Al Pacino, James Caan (who should have won), and Robert Duvall. The directing is absolutely spellbinding, the cinematography is terrific, costume design is great. To me, there is no better mob movie that explains the troubles of a Italian family in crime. I have many many favorite scenes, especially everyone else's favorite scene when John Marley finds his prized horse's head in his bed. There's that, and when Michael sends his guys to whack Moe Green and others during his baptism. The saddest scene in the film was when Sonny gets murdered, I know he was an ass-hole but he was cool too, it upset me so much I almost couldn't watch it anymore. I think the only scene that grabbed me was the very beginning of the film, when a man asks for ""justice"" over his daughter. I don't know why it always got my close attention, maybe it was because it was the very first scene in the movie, but ever since I was hooked on seeing that first scene whenever I would watch it. People often say that the best thing they get out of this film is Al Pacino as Michael, but I sort of disagree. Al Pacino launched his career in this movie, but the key element in this movie is Marlon Brando. This is the best and my favorite performance he has ever given in a movie, mainly because it was the first movie I have ever seen of him. I can honestly tell ya, that there is nothing like The Godfather. Ever! 11/10!"
4653,True,"Is The Godfather the best movie ever? Does it deserve #1 on the top 250? That's up to you. I don't think it deserves it, but it DEFINITELY deserves a spot on the top 250. Only a fool couldn't see why Marlon Brando won the Oscar for best actor for his role as Don Vito Corleone, even though he turned it down. This probably won best picture easily, but I wouldn't know. To tell the truth, The Godfather should have won all 11 Oscars it was nominated for. Al Pacino and Robert Duvall were amazing in this movie. Some people call it the best of The Godfather series, and even though I haven't seen parts II and III, I don't doubt them.The most memorable parts, scenes that have been copied countless times on TV and other films, are the toll booth scenes where Sonny dies and the cutbacks with the baptism of Connie's baby and the murders of the leaders of the other 4 families."
4654,True,"This must be, if not the, one of my favorite films of all.This masterpiece directed by Francis Ford Coppola is great, and the novel written by Mario Puzo is similarly magnificent. What I especially enjoy about this film are the dialogs. I believe that the best example of this would be the ever-lasting quote by Don Vito Corleone is ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" Another wonderful thing about this movie is that, despite the Paramount Executives, Al Pacino got the part for Michael Corleone, and ultimately made Pacino famous. The casting was exceedingly good: Bobby Duvall, Jimmy Caan, Talia Shire, Al Pacino, and Marlon Brando."
4655,True,"I always wanted to see this movie'cause I heard that it's a masterpiece...well...IT'S TRUE, DON'T MISS THE OPURTINITY TO WATCH IT!!!!!!!I have to say that it's a great movie.There is no actor or actress that I could say that he/she played bad his/hers character.It's really an amazing movie because every little detail is worked out.Al Pacino is one of my favorite actor but now he just got bigger and bigger for me:)))I really admire how the makers of this movie realized to put so much hate but yet so much love in the movie.It has some awesome cliff-hanger moments when you simply don't know if there's love or hate between them, like at the end when Michael kills his brother-in-law...or when also Michael simply lies in the face of his wife Kay.In the Corleone family there is nothing above the family business, Pacino's and Brando's cold look represents the best.Run and rent it now!!!!!!"
4656,True,"In Mario Puzo's the Godfather, the cast of Marlin Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Al Pachino, and Diane Keaton, is unique, and unbelievable. For the 10 rating, I am pretty much speechless. Never, have I ever seen a movie that was put together, in such a realistic, and perfectly graphical way as The Godfather. The way that the movie is outlined, is perfect as well as every other characteristic of the movie. Every actor was perfectly chosen, and uniformed to fit the outline of the movie, and the help the graphics and story-line of the movie become the best ever. Every actor in the movie not only had been chosen perfectly to play in The Godfather, but they were all chosen the perfect spot in the movie. My favorite part, is at the very end of the movie, when Marlin Brando, who was the current Godfather, died, leaving the job to Michael Corleone, his son. It was the perfect ending to lead into the 2nd Godfather, which was equally as good. I highly suggest, that you see them both. The 3rd one is terrible."
4657,True,"This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on a lot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family.This is definitely a ""must see"" masterpiece."
4658,True,"It is quite different from ordinary mafia movie. Of cause there are a few bloody scenes in the movie. But that is not the main point. The all time classic aimed at family life. That makes the mafia movie full of humanity. Although they are mafia, they are still human beings. They also cherish family though the way for protecting family is violent. That is the most attractive place for the movie.As to the director Francis Ford Coppola, he did a great job(in fact Paramont prepared to replace him anytime. Lukily they did not do so). He is an Italian. Maybe Italian emphasizes the importance of family. When he directed the movie, he successfully made the cast like a family. No wonder he still could gather the same cast to shoot Godfather the third after 16 years.As to performance, Al Pacino is unforgettable though he was a rookie. Marlon Brando deserved the Oscar award (best actor). Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton also were great. As to the music, still great.A mafia classic you absolutely should not miss. 9/10"
4659,True,"the godfather is the greatest movie of all times. it is filled with drama, intensity, and will keep you on the edge of your seat. if your not in to the mafia and 40's gangsters then you really wouldn't like it,but if you are into it you will appreciate this movie. even though the movie has some faults, you really don't notice them with all the drama going on. i really wouldn't recommend it to people that faint at the sight of blood because this movie is nothing but blood. the only thing bad is i had to watch it two times because it was really hard to follow. it is so much easier to watch it by myself. if you miss one little thing you basically miss the whole movie. but i think that this is one of Hollywood's best movies!"
4660,True,"Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic, all ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one.If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it.The film opens in the study of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Godfather, who is holding court. It is the wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request on that day. So the supplicants come, each wanting something different - revenge, a husband for their daughter, a part in a movie.The family has gathered for the event. Michael (Al Pacino), Don Vito's youngest son and a second world war hero, is back home in the company of a new girlfriend (Diane Keaton). The two older boys, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there as well, along with their ""adopted"" brother, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the don's right-hand man.With the end of the war, the times are changing, and as much as Don Vito seems in control at the wedding, his power is beginning to erode. By the standards of some, his views on the importance of family, loyalty, and respect are antiquated. Even his heir apparent, Sonny, disagrees with his refusal to get into the drug business. Gambling and alcohol are forces of the past and present; narcotics are the future. But Don Vito will not compromise, even when a powerful drug supplier named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) arrives with promises of high profits for those who back him.Don Vito's refusal to do business with Sollozzo strikes the first sparks of a war that will last for years and cost many lives. Each of the five major mob families in New York will be gouged by the bloodshed, and a new order will emerge. Betrayals will take place, and the Corleone family will be shaken to its roots by treachery from both within and without.The Corleone with the most screen time is Michael (it's therefore odd that Al Pacino received a Best Supporting Actor nomination), and his tale, because of its scope and breadth, is marginally dominant. His transformation from ""innocent"" bystander to central manipulator is the stuff of a Shakespearean tragedy. By the end, this man who claimed to be different from the rest of his family has become more ruthless than Don Vito ever was.Despite the likes of Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, Scarface, ...And Justice for All, and Scent of a Woman on his resume, Pacino is best remembered for the role he created in The Godfather (and subsequently reprised in two sequels). While this is not his most demonstrative performance - indeed, he is exceptionally restrained - the quality of the script makes Michael Corleone notable.Next to Humphrey Bogart's Rick from Casablanca, Oscar winner Marlon Brando's Don Vito may be the most imitated character in screen history. The line ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" has attained legendary status, as has the entire performance. With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando has created a personae that will be recalled for as long as motion pictures exist.Family responsibility. A father's legacy. The need to earn respect. The corrupting influence of power. These are some of the ingredients combined in Francis Ford Coppola's cinematic blender. They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries.Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York's Italian crime families. The word ""Mafia"" conjures up images of the sinister and mysterious - scenes of the sort where Luca Brasi meets his fate. Francis Ford Coppola has tapped into this fascination and woven it as yet another element of the many that make his motion picture a compelling experience.We come to The Godfather like Kay Adams - outsiders uncertain in our expectations - but it doesn't take long for us to be captivated by this intricate, violent world. The film can be viewed on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who demand much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but it is one-hundred seventy minutes well-spent. When the closing credits roll, only a portion of the story has been told. Yet that last haunting image (Kay's shock of recognition), coupled with Nino Rota's mournful score, leaves a crater-like impression that The Godfather Part II only deepens."
4661,True,"That two word summary captures my bottom line feelings about this film: simply extraordinary.This is, of course, Francis Ford Coppola's greatest film achievement to date. I frankly doubt that he, or anyone else, can surpass this film, although he gave it a pretty good run in ""Godfather II."" Part of what sets this film apart is that Coppola took one very well known star in Marlon Brando and surrounded him with an ensemble of lesser known actors. The result is that many of those lesser knowns were catapulted into stardom themselves, particularly Al Pacino (Michael Corleone) and Diane Keaton (Kay Adams). John Cazale is perfectly cast is the ignored middle child, Fredo Corleone, and James Caan turns in a memorable performance as the hot-tempered Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone.The subtle undertow of this film is that Coppola and Mario Puzo crafted a brilliant script that draws the viewer into a level of empathy with a family of cold-blooded killers. The Corleones are, after all, a family under siege after the surprise attack on the Don, the abduction of Tom Hagen (Duvall) and the murder of the Don's most trusted assassin, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana). The family draws closer, with the estranged son, Micahel, returning to rescue the family business from chaos. It becomes easy to lose sight of the fact that Coppola has the audience ""rooting"" for one set of ruthless murderers over the other set.The climax of the film occurs when Michael orchestrates the final revenge of the family for the murder attempt against his father, the murder of Sonny, the physical abuse of his sister, the abuse of Fredo and disrespect shown for the Corleone family in Las Vegas, the murder of his Sicilian wife, and against the traitor within the family business. Those scenes are controversial on many levels, not least of which was the juxtaposition of a number of the murders with the baptism of Michael's nephew.This film is a masterpiece of movie-making. You owe it to yourself to see it."
4662,True,"As just a drama film, the Godfather is excellent, with it's engaging storyline, well drawn characters, tight script, and all the rest of the clich√©s. In the genre of the Gangster film it has no peer.Where so many gangster pictures seem to just be commentaries on how quirky they are and how explosively violent, this film has so much more to say and explores the lives of it's characters from every perspective.We see the aging Don playing with a grandchild. We have the family member who wants nothing to do with the life of a wise-guy but whose love for his father and murder of his wife by rivals draws him in. We also see a gangster using violence not to solidify his position or intimidate, but simply acting violently to mistreatment of his sister.The film has such depth of realism and is so far above and beyond the scope of most gangster fare."
4663,True,"I suppose it's difficult to qualify exactly what formulates a tragedy.  Are tragedies about fate, disillusionment or death?  Are they about language? Must the plot adhere to a strict set of rules?  Must the climax come in the third act?  Well, my concept of a tragedy is when the flaws of one or more of its characters destroy a high goal.  In the case of the Godfather, this goal is the prevention of Michael's entry into the family business by making him a true American; the tragic flaw is Michael's inability to forego vengeance.Certainly many efforts are made to prevent Michael's tragic fate.  Michael himself seeks to evade becoming like his family.  When telling Kay about how his father released Johnny Fontaine from a band contract by making the band leader `an offer he couldn't refuse,' Michael says, `That's my family Kay, not me.'  While the rest of his family wears tuxedos at the wedding, Michael wears his dress uniform.  While his family talks about the drug business with Solozzo, Michael and Kay go shopping and go to the movies. 
By the time Michael saves his father in the hospital, it is already clear that Michael has no desire to be involved in the family business, but the attempt on his father's life is the first revelation of Michael's tragic flaw.  In the scene where Michael agrees to kill Solozzo and McClusky, Hagen tells Sonny that he is taking business matters personally.  When Michael agrees to kill them both, Sonny accuses him of the same.  Of course, a central irony of the Godfather is the fact that the family is the business, ties of blood and ties of money become inseparable.  Sonny's accusations are correct, Michael is taking the matter personally, the only major difference between Michael and Sonny is Michael's calculating patience.  This difference is painfully obvious by the end of the film.  Sonny dies because he carelessly charged after Carlo when he discovered that Connie was beaten after his initial death threat.  Michael waits for the perfect opportunity to have Carlo murdered, never allowing Carlo to suspect his motives.  After his betrayal, Tessio asks Tom Hagen to `tell Michael it was strictly business.'  Hagen replies that Michael knows.  Despite the fact that murdering Tessio and losing his knowledge of the Bronx is bad business, Michael has him killed.  This is further evidence that Michael is not acting out of his business interests, but his inability to forego vengeance.Kay is a very important figure in this tragedy, I say `figure' because to Michael, Kay as a person is irrelevant.  Kay's value to Michael is her lack of connection to his family.  She is from New Hampshire, so he most likely met her at Dartmouth (he went to college while his other brothers learned the family business). At the beginning of the film, Michael has Kay appear in his family photo.  He tells her everything about his family and while his family is planning, he is spending time with her notably shopping at the store `Best & Co.' and watching a movie about a nun.  These details are significant because Michael views Kay as a better sort of person than his family; he sees her as a figure of salvation.  When he returns from Italy and has entered the family business, Michael tells Kay that he has to marry her.  `The old way is finished.  Even my father knows that now.  In five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.'  Michael sees Kay as a figure through which he will achieve that legitimacy.  When Kay asks Michael if he had Carlo killed Michael's reaction is the exact opposite of what he would have told her at the beginning of the film.  Instead of telling Kay everything and defying the old rule of never letting women know about the family business, Michael told her all of his family's stories willingly and with complete honesty.  In this scene, Michael reveals not only that he won't let Kay know about his affairs, but lies he finally agrees.  The final shot of the movie, the closing of the door as a wiping fade out is significant because it shows Kay's separation from Michael.  She has literally and figuratively been removed from him, salvation rejected.Easily the most telling scene on this film's tragedy is the scene in which Vito tells Michael that he `didn't want this' for him.  He tells Michael that he wanted him to be a Senator or a Governor.  This is interesting when compared to Michael's rationalization of his work to Kay in which he suggests that all men of power are the same.  Vito dies in the very next scene of natural causes, but with the knowledge that the son for whom he had such great hope had been damned. The scene immediately following the death of Vito is the baptism of Michael's nephew, which is brilliantly cross-cut with the murders of the heads of the five families and Mo Green is a sequence in which holy water is crosscut with blood, renunciation of Satan is juxtaposed with acts of murder and the sacred is connected to the vile.  Vito's way of doing things is finished.  Vito openly told the heads of the families that `I forego the vengeance on my son' and `I will not be the man to break the peace of this day.'  It is Michael who breaks the peace.  Vito was a reluctant Godfather who spend his life running `harmless vices' and declaring that `we're not murderers' when refusing to hit the men who assaulted Bonassera's daughter, ultimately has a cold, calculating man who rationalizes murder as his successor, defying all his hopes for the future."
4664,True,"This film is basically the closest anyone is going to get to movie perfection. Coppola really hit the jackpot Puzo's novel and made the most out of it, I mean, many directors get their hands on some great stories and all they can do is mess the whole thing up. However, Coppola stayed true to the original novel, thanks in part to Puzo himself collaborating in the process of the screen writing, but also was able to give the movie his own feel, similar to what he did with Apocalypse Now. Also, visually, Coppola manages to show the 1940's mafia environment in the most stunning, and real, fashion.WARNING:SEVERAL SPOILERS ALL THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE COMMENTThe scene were the Don gets shot really shows what i'm talking about, and obviously the whole wedding at the beggining does the job of putting you in the environment perfectly, also it is a great introduction of all the major players. Also, the whole section were Michael is at Italy, it is downright beautiful, a great contrast to all of the violent stuff that happens in New York, all of this beauty ends with Michael's return to reallity, his wife's death. This then will make Michael the man that he becomes toward the end of the film, and through the other two films in the saga. Another great example of the ""horror"", is the scene with the decapitated horse is a showstopper and illustrates why Coppola is a genius. However, the heart of the film is in the perfomances themselves. Every single one of the characters is played to perfection, even after reading the novel, there is just no other way I can think of Vito Corleone, but by thinking of Brando. He is the Godfather, period. Well, so is Pacino, who shows that this is only the first of his many great performances. What can I say, to of the greatest performances in one film. The rest are not less great, Caan is convicingly stubburn and hotheaded Sonny, Duvall is great as a contrast to Sonny, always being more practical and reasonable (similar to Michael, yet lacks the superior IQ, and the coldheartedness), Cazale portrays the wimpy Fredo as what Fredo really is, whimpy. Diane Keaton plays great as the naive Kay, who in the end will finally realize what she has gotten herself into, but only too late, and all that is left is to accept her fate and learn to live with it. Shire is also very good as a drama queen, but not much else. The rest are just great mafiosi. Finally, to cap it all off, the music is beatiful. It is the trademark of the film, it is so famous that I know people that can recognize the music as the godfather tune, but have yet to see it, hey, even Slash used to play it live. Basically this film is perfect in everyway, ever since I saw it for the first time I compare every film to it, as a measuring stick, and to this day haven't been able to find a better one. This is one of those films that is not good enough to watch once, but to watch as many times as possible, it gets better everytime. After this, all the other films, are just that, other films."
4665,True,"From the wedding scene, the ""I Believe in America"" speech, and the horses' head in the bed, there has not been a better film.  While you may think this designation is undeserved, you would be wrong.  Few movies have slipped into society like this one has. The opening wedding scene ranks as one of the most effective introductions in film history.  We get to know all the characters, from Don Vito Coreleone (Marlon Brando, in a masterful performance) to his sons, Michael (Al Pacion), Sonny (James Caan), and Fredo (John Cazale). 
  Several scenes from this movie will remain in your mind for quite a while. Marlon Brando's wheezing death, The baptism sequence cut in with several murders.  The beginning wedding sequence, and the ending.  The dialogue is perfect, thanks to an incredible script by Mario Puzo and CoppolaEverything about this film is on target.  Nino Rota's beautiful score is one of the best, with the ""Love Theme"" ranking as one of the most famous pieces of film music ever.  The performances are all first rate.  Though Marlon Brando won the award, it is really Al Pacino who is the lead actor, and deserved the best actor Oscar.  James Caan also finds the right note as the aggressive, impulsive Sonny.  The cinematography and art direction are perfect.  And all this comes down to Francis Ford Coppola's masterful direction.  There is no way Bob Fosse deserved the Oscar over Coppola.
  Is this film better than Citizen Kane?  Tough to say. Both were ground-breaking classics that utilized new technical and narrative techniques.  I would have to say yes, because the story here, about loyalty, family and honor, had more impact on me than the rise and fall of Charles Foster Kane."
4666,True,"well, i worked in a video store for five years and for five years everyone nagged me to see 'the godfather' and for whatever reason it simply never interested me. i love films but wouldn't consider myself a pedant who nitpicks about minor details. a film doesn't have to be entirely perfect for me to enjoy it or feel that it was worthwhile to watch. i like to get lost in a film when i watch it. be it a quick comedy or an epic saga. there are films that have plenty of continuity errors and even bits of really bad acting, and i've watched them several times, because it's a satisfying experience. well, i finally watched the godfather tonight. i finally felt ready to watch it without bias and without towing all the talk and hype behind it into the experience (well, i did the best i could to start with a clean slate, but couldn't always succeed. for example, i'm sure the horse head in the bed at the beginning would have been more shocking and effective if i hadn't heard that scene referenced thousands of times). overall, i have to say that i really wasn't very impressed, and, even before i remembered that it was, in fact, based on a book, i was left with that empty sensation of too much missing information and imbalance of characters that sadly happens with too many adaptations. also -- and as i said, i don't deliberately go seeking out errors, especially during a first viewing, but... -- the editing in so many parts was really bad enough to take away from the movie experience. it was difficult to pay attention to the dialogue because the cut-to's during some of the conversations were so blatantly recorded at different times that i forgot about my own involvement in the film and instead had to sit through these confusing cuts. likewise with the 40's atmosphere. i'll bring 'the hype' into the argument for a moment here to comment only in retrospection, but for all the talk of how classic and what a masterpiece this film is, i would have thought it to be more... i don't know... scrutinised? and there were just too many times when i would find myself involved in a scene, drawn in, convinced, fully attentive, and then there would be a completely random cut, even dialogue cut in mid-sentence when fading to the next scene. so strange. parts gave me the impression of watching a well-financed, well-meaning rough draft. all that said, some of the acting, not all, but some, was in fact, first rate. Marlon Brando really didn't convince me. he was good. but nothing special, i'm almost sorry to say. the wife (i forget her name) who was married at the beginning, she always seemed really out of place and ... i can't quite put my finger on it, but her fits just didn't flow with the film. i thought James Caan did a great job. i've only ever seen him in 'thief' and 'bottle rocket,' so i can't really make any worthy comparisons with other performances. but his hot-headedness was convincing enough. Robert Duvall was great. i didn't recognise him for almost the first half of the film. another acting gem for me was Al Pacino. he, too, i didn't recognise at the beginning of the film. for a few moments i mistook him for Adrian Brody, even though i knew that was impossible. but i was immediately drawn in by ""Michael's"" performance. every gesture and every word was electric. it took me about twenty minutes to realise that i was watching Al Pacino. then, furthermore, i was really impressed by the evolution of his character. that's one thing i think they really nailed solid with this film, from Pacino's acting to the storyline and editing and everything all rolled into one. i came away entirely convinced and ruminating on the life and thoughts of this character. i watched and admired the power he carried in his manner even when he was, in the beginning, insofar as the bloody family business was concerned, innocent. then saw that power unfold and transform itself until, in the end, he was finally consumed by the corruption inherent in the prioritisation of his blood-family's honour. however, apart from this character and a few other performances, there really wasn't enough ""meat"" to this movie to make me want to see it again. i'm curious about the sequel(s), to see where the story goes. but by the end of this first viewing i was mostly just wondering who was going to die next, and i didn't really care. i was plenty intrigued by Michael, but i felt like i was mostly sticking around to see who would be left standing by the time the credits rolled. maybe the whole mafia style depiction thing just isn't enough for me to be able to sympathise or feel anything when the next trench coat gets strangled or shot or stabbed. so, overall, there were indeed a very few classic moments, and some of the acting was really well performed. but on the whole it just didn't chalk up to much for me, least of all a masterpiece."
4667,True,"This film is NOT a masterpiece. People are simply over hyping this movie because they know that Hollywood has no other films that are superior to this garbage. When it comes to the actors Marlon Brando, Al Pacino etc. It becomes obvious throughout the film that they are just actors and did not work that hard to make falseness look like reality. Their performances were terrible and almost ruined half the film for me. The dialogues were not even original. This film is not realistic. Marlon Brando looks like a coca doodle do. How are these characters even supposed to be gangsters when all they do is just kill other gangsters and help the poor and needy people? That's not the acting of a mafia don! Their performances were NOT believable whatsoever. I could tell that they were acting the whole entire time. Constipated looks on the faces of Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. This film is a joke! It's funny how everyone says Godfather (an average film at best) is the greatest film of all time but they don't even give any real reasons. What scenes of the film make it so great in the eyes of the audience?"
4668,True,"It's a beautifully made movie. Not just because of the subtle direction by Francis Coppola but because of the production design (Dean Tavoularis) and photography (Gordon Willis). Everything seems to lend itself to the impact of the story, which describes the replacement of Marlon Brando's Mafia chief by his youngest son, Al Pacino. Make up is expertly handled. Pacino's broken cheek is properly swollen and blue and fades gradually, providing the viewer with a kind of cinematic clock telling the passage of time. Nino Rota's score is tops. During the baptism scene, which takes place in a church, the organ hums an apt courtly tune. Then, as the film cross cuts between ritualized religion and ritualized homicide, the organ insensibly becomes darker and more ominous.These departments seldom get enough credit -- except recently in CGI extravaganza's. The more nuanced touches in furnishings, wardrobe, shadows and the like generally go unrewarded by the public. But this film, and a few others like it (""Shane"", ""Verdict"") wouldn't be what they are if they'd been clumsily handled.Brando has given maybe four nearly perfect performances and this is one of them. To appreciate it we have to skip over all his failed attempts to extend his range, the dancing bookmaker, the comic Oriental sidekick. The Don Corleone we see doesn't radiate power so much as fatigue. Al Pacino is transformed from a smiling lad, happy to be home from the war, to a dispassionate kingpin of crime at the end, a bit too abruptly. Sterling Hayden, as the corrupt Irish cop, has invested this much in a role only once before, in ""Dr. Strangelove."" Example: After smashing Pacino's face with one blow of his oversized fist, Hayden turns away, winces with self control and pounds his fist into the night-time air.It's hard to imagine how Coppola could have improved on his direction of this tragic tale. With the exception of the violent scenes, of which there are many, maybe too many, the film's texture is smooth and understated. Example: A baker shows up at the hospital just before some would-be assassins arrive and Pacino talks this innocent man into posing as a gunman. Not a word from the baker. He does what he's told. And when it's safe, he tries to light a cigarette but his hands are shaking so badly that Pacino has to light it for him.The women don't have much to do. Diane Keaton as the Shiksa is puzzled but hopeful. Talia Shire as the abused wife is hysterical. Mamma Corleone is a revered background figure who rarely shows up.That's the good stuff -- and it's very good indeed.The bad stuff, I'm not sure about. The Corleone family, like the other five families in New York, are making a fortune. That's evident from their digs, their cars, their raw silk suits. But what business are they in? That's one of the things Keaton is curious about. The businesses are only alluded to twice -- "" the gambling, the liquor, even the women."" Well, what's so bad about that? Who gives a damn about illegal gambling, smuggled liquor, or escort services? Nobody. Drugs are brought in towards the end, but only dealt with discretely. We never sell it around schools, it must be strictly controlled, and let the darkies up in Harlem have it and ""kill their souls."" The words ""extortion,"" ""protection racket,"" and ""Mafia"" are never used. This is a pretty rotten business they're in. And if Marlon Brando' Don was a kind of community organizer, Al Pacino's Don is a ruthless hypocrite. In fact, he's a lying, murdering, thief. While he is solemnly taking his oath as godfather to his nephew, his minions are out in the streets slaughtering rivals wholesale -- and in the most graphic way.""Never ask me about my business,"" he tells his wife. And one hopes she never does, unless she wants to wind up ""sleeping with the fishes."""
4669,True,"On the day of his only daughter's wedding, Don Vito Corleone hears requests in his role as the Godfather, the head of a New York crime family. Vito's youngest son, Michael, in a Marine Corps uniform, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the sprawling reception. Vito's godson Johnny Fontane, a popular singer, pleads for help in securing a coveted movie role, so Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to the abrasive studio head, Jack Woltz, to secure the casting. Woltz is unmoved until the morning he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion. Shortly before Christmas 1945, drug baron Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo, backed by the Corleones' rivals, the Tattaglias, asks Vito for investment in the emerging drug trade and protection through his political connections. Vito disapproves of drug dealers, so he sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to spy on them. The family then receives two fish wrapped in Brasi's vest, imparting that he ""sleeps with the fishes"". An assassination attempt by Sollozzo's men lands Vito in the hospital, so his eldest son, Sonny, takes command. Sollozzo kidnaps Hagen to pressure Sonny to accept his deal. Michael thwarts a second assassination attempt on his father at the hospital; his jaw is broken by Police Captain McCluskey, who is also Sollozzo's bodyguard. Sonny retaliates for the attacks on his father by having Tattaglia's son killed. Michael comes up with a plan to hit Sollozzo and McCluskey: on the pretext of settling the dispute, Michael accepts their offer to meet in a Bronx restaurant, retrieves a planted handgun, and murders them. Despite a clampdown from the authorities, the Five Families erupt in open warfare and the brothers fear for their safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily, and Fredo Corleone is sheltered by associate Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks his brother-in-law Carlo on the street for abusing his sister Connie and threatens to kill him if he abuses her again. When it happens again, Sonny speeds for her home but assassins ambush him at a highway toll booth and riddle him with submachine gun fire. Michael's time abroad has led to marriage to Apollonia Vitelli. Their euphoria is shattered when a car bomb intended for him takes her life. Devastated by Sonny's death, Vito decides to end the feuds. Believing that the Tattaglias were under orders of the now dominant Don Emilio Barzini, he promises, before the heads of the Five Families, to withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo revenge for his son's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to a father saddened by his involvement in the family business and marries Kay the next year. With his father at the end of his career and his surviving brother too weak, Michael takes the reins of the family, promising Kay that he will make the business legitimate within five years. To that end, he insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Tom is not a ""wartime consigliere""; the older man agrees Tom should ""have no part in what will happen"" in the coming battles with rival families. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos, Greene derides the Corleones as a fading power. To add injury to insult, Michael sees Fredo falling under Greene's sway. Vito collapses and dies in his garden while playing with Michael's son, Anthony. At the funeral, Salvatore Tessio arranges a meeting between Michael and Don Barzini, signaling his treachery as Vito had warned. The meeting is set for the same day as the christening of Connie's son, to whom Michael will stand as godfather. As the christening proceeds, Corleone assassins, acting on Michael's orders, murder the other New York dons and Moe Greene. Tessio is told that Michael is aware of his betrayal and taken off to his death. After Carlo is questioned by Michael on his involvement in setting up Sonny's murder and confesses he was contacted by Barzini, Peter Clemenza kills him with a wire garrote. Michael is confronted by Connie, who accuses him of having her husband killed. He denies killing Carlo when questioned by Kay, an answer she accepts. As Kay watches warily, Michael receives his capos, who address him as the new Don Corleone."
4670,True,"For years, I never wanted to see The Godfather because something always told me it was slightly overrated. Film fanatics have praised The Godfather (and it's sequel) as two of the best films ever made, and I could just never understand what could be so good about it. So, last year, I felt it was time to finally give the trilogy a go. And you know what? Everyone truly is right. It really is one of the best films ever made.The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family. The Corleone's are a Sicilian family involved in organized crime. When the Don, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in an Oscar winning role)is shot in the streets (he lives), he asks his son Michael (Al Pacino, in an Oscar nominated role) to take over the family business. Michael never wanted to be in the family business. He always dreamed of just staying away from it, and living a peaceful life with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton). But once he takes on the role of the Don, he realizes that there is no going back, and nothing can ever be the same.The Godfather is a film that mainly focuses on two main subjects: family and betrayal. Both subjects are depicted beautifully. Director Francis Ford Coppola and his screenwriter Mario Puzo (who also wrote the novel) have made what is easily the best movie about family ever made. But yet they take the family movie to a whole new level.The Godfather is three hours of pure perfection. Every actor here nails it, especially Brando. Brando is an actor that we beg to see more of. Even though the film mainly focuses on Pacino's character, it is obviously Brando's show. But even though it is Brando's show, it is also sort of everyone's show. Hell, it could even be considered James Caan's show, because while he is in it, he steals the show.The Godfather is easily one of Francis Ford Coppola's best films. Yes, it is an amazing movie, and it isn't even his best movie. This is one of the greatest movies ever made. I can't quite say it's my favorite movie ever, but it is certainly up there somewhere. It truly deserved best picture, and screenplay. But why the hell didn't it win best director? That Oscar had FFC's written all over it. If you haven't seen it, see it before you die.A+"
4671,True,"Rarely can it be said that a film is genre-defining, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. The romanticism of the Mafia is so vividly portrayed that one can't help but fall in love with the film, and the Corleone family. Well-known for its authentic visuals and the occasional sudden brutal bloody violence, The Godfather earned rave reviews worldwide upon its release, and certainly deserved its success.Solid performances from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, among others, earned the film an amazing four Oscar nominations for acting roles, with the former awarded an Oscar. The brilliance of The Godfather is that it's able to combine many themes and sub-plots together without confusing the viewer. Character interaction is flawless, and the captivating screenplay makes three hours well spent.Director Francis Ford Coppola lays much of the groundwork of 1970s cinema with his commanding technique. The audacious, visceral, and stately set pieces are legendary - horse's head in the bed, Sonny's horrific slaughter etc. Not to forget Nino Rota's mournful and oddly romantic famous score, which is able to conjure up different moods within the film. I shall make you an offer that you can't refuse - watch The Godfather.SCORE: 10/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"
4672,True,"I have read the book years ago, but never saw the movie. I heard it was the greatest movie of all time and there was no criticisms. i saw this just last month, and it is a near perfect film! I have never seen such a powerful, believable, and moving movie since Schindler's List and Braveheart! The film captures the classical viewpoint of the best-selling novel by Mario Puzo in a very dark, but epic way, revealing the mafia as a manipulating and greedy domain of not just villains, but also of their families. The film is almost a family film in such a way that it is about family, the power of it, and that it should be loved and honored. Taht is one of the main reasons why this is such a glamorous film! The story takes place in the 1940s and 50s, and is about a mafia family called the Coreleone's who came from Sicily. They're a very powerful mafia in New York city led by an aging, persuasive man, Vito Coreleone played by the ultimate Marlon Brando.The story kicks off with the issues and members of the Coreleone family. When Vito Coreleone is gunned down by another mafia family, all hell breaks loose, bringing together the family from the hot-tempered Sonny (James Caan) who is the runner up for leading the Coreleone family, Michael (Al Pacino) who does everything in his power to not join the mob, and Tom Hagen (Rob Duvall), whose the advisable councilor.The story follows these individuals and even more towards the history of this family, with its comings and goings of friends and foes, and issues and solutions.The acting top-notched is excellent, especially by Marlon Brando who well deserved the Oscar. The story is gripping, the settings and costumes are vivid, the cinematography has that gloomy and dark feel, the pace is moderate, the score is dramatic, and the director was well chosen for this film! Everything is great, and i will enjoy this film and over again as millions of others do. 10/10!"
4673,True,"""The Godfather"" is a good movie that should have been a much better one. It has almost everything it needs: a stellar cast, a story based on a bestseller, great music, lush cinematography, etc. It makes a kind of visual poetry out of many of its scenes. But in the end it lacks a soul. As a movie about the Mafia, it made its characters too lovable, whitewashing the brutality, hypocrisy, stupidity and sleaze of real gangsters. We like the characters too much; we want to be like them, deliver their lines. It leaves out even the few ideas that the book had. In the end it is a story well told, but eventually, a story about nothing (not in the Seinfeld sense, either.)."
4674,True,"well i finally got round to watching Part 1 for the first time on Channel 5, I just wonder why i never got round to it earlier. This movie has set the standards for epic story's (why do people compare this to LOTR?). You can really see the drastic change that is happening to Vito and how the family business is changing. This film was also one of the few that can make me Very tense (especially when Vito was *SPOILER* at the restaurant talking to the bent Cop after going to the Bathroom) It just made me on the edge of my seat with anticipation on whether he would do it or how it would happen.This deserves the NO.1 top spot for definite. I just cant wait to watch Parts 2 + 3 of this 9 hour epic! Overall 10/0 Only fault that i could pick was that it is difficult the first time through to remember all the characters names (but i still knew who they were, just not WHO they were exactly (if you get what i mean))"
4675,True,"First seeing The Godfather you'll probably have a good idea of what it is about a Mafia family.It is never mentioned as a Mafia film,and I do not believe the word Mafia is used in the film.For the Corleone family its a part of their business and lives.We know what the Corleone's are doing is evil and wrong,but The Godfather isn't told from our point of few it is told from the point of few of The Corleone family.With understanding this we are able to understand the characters more,and have sympathy for them.Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone is a respectable man,he is offered to get into the drug business and he says it is wrong.The audience of course know that Vito is a cold hearted killer,but he comes across as a sad man.A crucial establishing scene in the beginning of the movie,has an undertaker asking Vito for justice,Vito says that he will receive it,but he will ask him a favor in the future.Vito is gunned down and is sick the rest of his life,his son Sanito ""Sonny"" Corleone takes his Father's place.Sonny is betrayed and gunned down in a violent war.A sad Vito comes in to the Undertaker asking his favor,clean up his body so his mother doesn't have to seem him like this.The story of The Godfather does not belong to Vito Corleone though he only plays a part in it.The Godfather is the story of the transfer of Vito's empire to his other son Michael.Michael is actually a decent guy,he has a girlfriend he plans to wed,and is a war hero.Michael in tears tells his Father he will be there for him next to his hospital bed.Michael kills the men who set-up his father.Vito even tells Michael he didn't want a life of crime for him,he wanted him to become something more.Through the course of the movie Michael becomes a man possibly worse than his father,he is a tragic figure you feel for.The Godfather is brilliantly directed by Francis Ford Coppola.It is arguably the best directed film of all time.It has a dark feel to it.The acting is brilliant too,there is no bad performance in this film.The Godfather is a must see,for any fan of movies.If you could only place one film to represent the 20th Century and movies,The Godfather would probably be that film.A Very High 10/10"
4676,True,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!What can be said that hasn't been said already? Is this the best movie ever? Along with the Seven Samurai and Vertigo i would say yes. The cast is massive, they all have a part to play, and all perform with excellence. The scope is huge, the direction flawless, the score is one of the best, lots of memorable images, lots of violence, and endless points of discussion. if i try to find faults, i would be picky, and the faults would be minor-the wedding scene at the start goes on for too long, with too much singing and dancing, but i can see what Coppola is doing. We get a genuine sense of the family, its home life and business life, with the female members pushed away so that the men can do what they think they have to do. My favourite images are Michael standing outside the hospital, pretending to hold a gun, the first time he sees Apollonia, McCluskey with a bullet in his head, and all the mob deaths at the end. 10 out of 10"
4677,True,"The Godfather is one of those movies that come around once ever so often that leave you in awe of it's greatness. Its a story of so many demintons, twists and turns and yet, it's not hard to follow. The Godfather is a film where it's hard to pick the bad guys from the good guys. It's a story of how even the most innocent of people can take part in the most despicable actions if the right pieces come to place. It's a story of family, love, hate, and murder. Mario Puzo's The Godfather is a sure fire classic that wont disappoint. Spoilers Ahead So The Godfather is about this Mafia boss named Vito Corleone (The Late Marlon Brando) who is a Italian immigrant who came to this country during the early 20th century (as you will see in part II). So he's in the gambling racket in New York and has many crooked politicians and other people of power right in his pocket. He has 2 Sons: Micheal (Al Pacino)and Sonny (James Cann). Sonny is his right hand man who is hier as head of the family, Sonny is the epidiemy of the hothead who is impossible to talk to with out pissing him off. During the film while at a tollbooth in Jeresy he's trapped like a rat in a huge boobytrap and is shot many times, thus his demise. And of coarse there's Micheal who is the innocent one of the family. A war veteran and college boy, Micheal has his hands clean of any blood, at least for a while. One day while getting some fruit, Don Corleone was shot 5 times in the back by a man who he refused to do business with. To say the least, the brothers where not happy. So squeaky clean Micheal comes up with a plan to kill the men who tried to kill his father (by the way, Vito came though). He invited the two men to an old style restaurant in The Bronx to ""talk"". While they were talking, Micheal asked to go to the bathroom. While he was there he grabbed the gun that he hid behind the toilet, he took it out and killed them both. the plan went as planed, but Micheal had to go to Italy until the whole ordeal had cooled down.Some assorted stuff happened (like his brother death) while he was gone but when he was in Italy, he met he future wife Appellonia. They were married for awhile until she died because of a car bomb. Soon afterwards, he gets word of his brothers death and returns to the states. Soon after he returns his father strokes out making him the new ""Don"". Here, you can really see Micheal change from a kind innocent man to a cold hearted mafia man who kills his brother in law, despite the objections of his sister.One of the most cruel and ironic movies ever, The Godfather is with out a doubt the best film ever made. There will never be another one like it, this film had it all. a 10/10 all the way!"
4678,True,"SPOILERSFor the sake of a personal confession, this review of the Godfather is not as neutral and objective as it should be. For that I apologise, but with good reason.In August 2003, after watching ""The Godfather"" in what I assume now must have been a tired state, I condemned and criticised this film for being overrated, drawn out and dull. Today on the eighth of July 2004, I apologise for such a flawed review. ""The Godfather"", whilst still perhaps not worthy of it's number one slot, is one of the best films ever created.In this film, we are introduced to the Corleone family. The story starts at the wedding of Connie Corleone to Carlo Rizzi. As is tradition amongst Sicillian families, Connie's father, The Godfather, Don Vito Corleone hands out favours to those who respectfully ask for his help. At the wedding as well are the Don's other children, Fredo (John Cazale), the violent Sonny (James Caan) and the youngest, the war hero, Michael (Al Pacino). Over two and a half hours of film later and the lives of Vito and his family are changed forever as this one Gangland family fights with external and internal problems.""The Godfather"" is a beautiful piece of cinema. With the late Marlon Brando putting in a fine performance as Vito, the film had a figurehead character. Ultimately however, it is Al Pacino who deserves most praise. Rarely can there be shown in a film such a dramatic change in a character over such a space of time. Going from a law abiding war hero returning from the Second World War with medals and a beautiful wife, Pacino's Michael gradually changes in appearance and style as he takes his place at the head of the family. Everything about him is designed to show the change in his character. His hair changes style, his clothes change style, even his face changes mannerisms (although partly due to his jaw being broken by a corrupt police chief). Pacino as Michael demonstrates just how truely awesome an actor he is.The acting alone is not just what makes this film great. The way in which characters are added and removed from the story is clever. Nobody is too good a character to be written out and everybody is given a chance to play a key role in the events.The musical direction of ""The Godfather"" is another part of it's beauty. As well as the obvious piece of music which everyone is aware of, the ways in which sound is used to keep our attention at times is superb. The background music and the location from Michael's time in Italy is beautiful. All in all, there's nothing which can be faulted.When I originally wrote a review for this film last year, I complained of how it was overrated and dull, that is a mistake I now regret. ""The Godfather"" is a beautiful film that I might not necessarily place at number one in the internet movie database all time list, but which I can see why it is there. This film is a piece which everyone should be forced to watch and a piece which, if they pay attention to it, they will love."
4679,True,"BAR NONE! As of now, this film is the greatest film ever made. I'm sure something will eventually surpass it, but it'll really take a spectacular movie to do it. This film has it all - an extremely powerful, believable story, an all-star cast and a director (Francis Ford Coppola) who made the effort and took the time to do it right! The story is of a Mafia family in the 30's through the 60's and the events that catapult a son into control of the family's empire. Al Pacino, in particular, did a fantastic job as Michael Corleone, son of his father, although he didn't intend it to be that way. There is a lot of violence, but it's not there for violence's sake. The world of organized crime was much more violent in the past than it seems to be now and the violence is depicted as more or less just a part of doing business. This is perhaps Marlon Brando's greatest performance (as the father) ever. Other great actors include James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire. This is one of the best-cast films I've ever seen. I intend to always own a copy of this film!"
4680,True,"This is a fantastic movie that truly defines classic cinema. How do I even begin to describe the skill with which this movie is made? The viewer is taken to a setting of violence in deception set within the scope of 1950's New York City. In the beginning of the movie the viewer mistakenly believes they grasp the concept of what it means to hold a position in the mafia, but this concept is quickly replaced with an almost uncomfortable sense of familiarity. The story is told through the legendary actors portraying some of the most complex and meaningful characters of all time.However I gave this movie one star...because it didn't have To Logan"
4681,True,The greatest movie ever!! I love the cast and the story line! This my GOAT of all time.The creation with this film is very well put together.I alreasy love mob films and autobios of great mob story but this one tell in detail what the mob was really about and that make for a great and understandable movie..I realt enjoy all the parts of this movie..5 stars+
4682,True,"I was very young when I first saw this movie and it seemed so very real.The way the characters portrayed organized crime with such realism I was engaged from the opening scene.I could usually tell a Great movie within the first 5 minutes,I knew it was great in less than that. This is a perfect 10 out of 10."
4683,True,"This movie is widely considered in the community of film critics to be a landmark in motion picture history and is rightfully so ranked up there with Citizen Kane and Casablanca as one the best movies in history. The lines are iconic, the scenes of family, betrayal and violence are all memorable, the performances are beyond Oscar worthy and it does what any great adaptation does; stay as faithful to the original as possible and only make changes whenever necessary. For me the most iconic scene is the baptism murders, which I fell are appropriately edited as Michael Corleone oversees the baptism of his infant son. The only minor nitpick I have is that, although Marlon Brando does give a solid performance, the look they gave him is a little too much like a geezer for me to believe he is a Mafia don. Nonetheless, this is a film that anyone taking a cinema class should watch."
4684,True,"'The Godfather' - who not seen it yet, as not been live, cult and excellent movie, one of (not just) my favorite. I love godfather, i can see it, maybe...maybe, 10x, maybe 15x and every time I look like child which get new toy. Music is one of the best ever (not just OST), camera is also brilliant, ALL actors are daring and stunning as director of this spectacle. And Fredo Corleone is adorable. Everyone, must see it, and when I say everyone, I mean everyone. 100%, 10/10, 5/5, 4/4 or how you want. Just...just WOW. Thank you to all the crew of the film, you are all worthy of an Oscar."
4685,True,"The film beautiful and wonderful and worth seeing already, actors are great and as especially fuel godfather and Mr. Scar Face and thanks to all representatives who Mthelo crew and directing and publishing to you and I hope everyone watching the movie because he is really great and stronger than wonderful and thank you for all and I hope one day beautiful for everyone and I loved very film and I hope movie playback because Bale I hope to see him again because he Atges for the Mafia and is very large and I lover like Mr. Scar Face and I am grateful to each crew with him and thank them for what Amilo both worked hard on the success of the film and the most and the most prevalent in the Arab world and Majabin The film 'The Godfather' Thank you for all and I wish you health and wellness for each GOOD Bay"
4686,True,"In 1945, at his daughter Connie's wedding, Vito Corleone hears requests in his role as the Godfather, the Don of a New York crime family. Vito's youngest son, Michael, who was a Marine during World War II, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a famous singer and godson to Vito, seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to Los Angeles to talk the obnoxious studio head, Jack Woltz, into giving Johnny the part. Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion.The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name. It stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone, focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss."
4687,True,"This movie is chock full of stellar performances, beautiful shots, and a compelling family saga. If it is too long (it is), a little slow in places (it is) and somewhat hard to follow in certain places (yep) we can forgive it, because they just don't make movies like this anymore. This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic."
4688,True,"One the greatness movies of cinema. Amazing, anything is better there. One of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes, The Godfather gets everything right; not only did the movie transcend expectations, it established new benchmarks for American cinema. The early life and career of Vito Corleone in 1920s New York is portrayed while his son, Michael, expands and tightens his grip on his crime syndicate stretching from Lake Tahoe, Nevada to pr-revolution 1958 Cuba. Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi- generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" ."
4689,True,"I have to admit, this is a pretty great movie but, it's way too long for a great movie like this. I absolutely would love if this was only two hours and not three, I think it gave enough detail on what's happening of the dynasty. Marlon Brando was very much excellent at playing as the Godfather. I loved his quote ""I'll make an offer that you can't refuse"", it sounds class and like a boss. He's such a serious legend like, he actually does look pretty young to play as the Godfather, especially all the make - up and other stuff that had to be put on his face. I say it was very oily on the skin lol! I think this movie deserved 3 Oscars but I wouldn't consider it to be that serious since the length of the film was way too long! At least I finally got to see it, 43 years later!"

4691,True,"In my opinion, this could have been a little better than what it was. One scene that I believe could have been better in a sense, would be the scene where they could have done better was when they were in the house at the very start of the movie; where Peter Clemenza is talking to Don Corleone. The reason why I believe that this scene could have done better, was because the lighting may have worked in some instances such as trying to create an eerie lighting effect. Long story short, the lighting effects that a movie gives off has some sort of persuasive effect on the audience's feelings towards the film, in my eyes the lighting effect wasn't good enough to rate it higher than a six out of ten."
4692,True,"This Film is almost 3 hours long! I like the story, acting by Al Pacino and Marlon Brando but after I watch this movie on my TV for 1 hour, I start to look at my phone. The spoiler in which Vito Corleone died is dramatic( Which is a good thing). But after I watch this movie, I have mixed feeling, whether I felt happy that Michael take over the Corleone family or should feel bad after for the past 2+ hours that some of the character died in the end. But still, good effort by the director himself. When I think that when critics and people think that this is the best film of all time, I have some doubts about it, maybe other films like the wizard of oz or Forrest Gump might be better."
4693,True,"America, 40s Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is respected and feared leader of one of the five Mafia families in New York. He has four children: Connie (Talia Shire), impulsive Sonny (James Caan), the pusillanimous Freddie (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino), who wants no business of his father. When Corleone, against the advice of Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), refuses to intervene in the drug business, the head of another band ordered his assassination. Then begins a violent and bloody war between Mafia families. (PRO) The wedding sequence ... is a virtuoso moment of cinematic art: Coppola takes his large cast of actors on stage with such art that makes us fully enter the world of 'The Godfather'"
4694,True,I had the chance to watch the first uncensored version. Breathtaking and a great historical flashback. Note: 16+ violence One of Oliver Stones master piece.

4695,True,"The Film ""The Godfather"" Is Without Doubt The Best Film I Have Ever Seen, The Direction Is Perfect And The Acting Is Unbeatable. The Godfather Is A Long Film So If You Cant Watch A Movie For 2:57 Hours Then Skip This Film Even Though You Should Not. WARNING This Review Contains SPOILERS For ""The GodFather"" So If You Don't Want Spoilers For The Godfather Leave Now You've Been Warned, And The Godfather Is A Violent Movie So If Your Not 12+ Leave Now. Lets Begin, The Film The Godfather Starts In The Wedding Of The Daughter Of Vito Or Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) Were Not So Much Violence Happens But Mainly Presents The Cast. I Wont Lie The First 0:43 Minuets Of The Film Were Not As Good As The 2:14 Hours To Follow But A Major Plot Point Comes In That Time So Its Important. The First Half Of The Film is About The Corleone's Regular Days, But All That Changes When SPOILER ALERT: Don Corleone Is Nearly Killed From Another Mafia Who Already Killed An Other Character Luca Brasi Which Changes Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) From A Good Man To The Mafia Man He Never Wanted To Become. After Michael And His Brothers Fredo And Sonny Take Charge Over The Family Until They're Dad Comes Back, They Have A Meal With A Police Officer Who Broke Michaels Jaw, Michael Shoots The Cop And His Bodyguard What Causes The Second Half Of The Film When Michael Must Fly To Italy And He Stays There For Two Years Which All Contain Him Falling In Love, Getting Marred, Finding Out His Brother Sonny Was Killed, Wanting To Go Back To New York And Having His Wife Be Killed By One Of His Bodyguards. After Michaels Wife Is Killed He Returns To New York There He Meets His Ex Girlfriend Katherine (Diane Keaton) Who He Ends Up Marring And Having A Child With. There Is A Part In The Film Were You See Don Corleone Back On His Feet Talking To Michael And That For Me Is Were His Acting As The Don Really Shins And That Is Were His Character Really Connected To Me And Made Him One Of The Best Characters Of All Time For Me. One Of The Saddest Parts In The Film Is Around The End And Huge SPOILER ALERT Here This Is Big: In A Scene You See Don Corleone And Michaels Son Playing Around The Garden When All Of A Sudden Don Corleone Falls To The Ground And Dies And In That Scene You Can Really Feel The Sadness And Are Even More Sad When Michaels Son Keeps Spraying Don With Water And Dose Not Know His Dead. There Are Few Scenes That Thrilled Me As Much As The Baptising Scene In ""The Godfather"" Were You See Michael And His Wife Come To The Church To Become The Godparents Of Constanzia The Daughters Son And In That Scene You Can Also See Michaels First Acts As Leader Of The Corleone Family Which Includes Killing Of The Leader Of The Mafia Who Tried To Kill His Dad And More Stuff Of That Type An Is Just Incredible And Amazing. This Film Is Full Of Amazing Action And Intense Scenes Full Of Nail Biting Moments I Would Highly Suggest You Watch It If You Haven't Already And I Give It An: A+ Or A: 100/100 Or A: 11/10 Because Its That Good!."
4696,True,"In a college level FILM 249 course Fall 2014, we studied the film ""The Godfather"". What I suggest a viewer watch for during the film is oranges and the color orange. The purpose or reasoning behind the director's inclusion of this may be to foreshadow any danger or violence. In multiple instances throughout the movie an orange or the color orange is seen with or on someone that is involved in a violent act. For example, there is a bowl of oranges in front of Woltz at dinner and he wakes up with a horse head in between his legs. Another example is when Don Corleone is shot multiple times he topples to the ground, spilling a produce setup of oranges."
4697,True,"The finest performances of all time both from MARLON BRANDO and AL' PACINO....a must watch film for all generations...no wonder Marlon Brando is considered one of the greatest actors in the history of world cinema...dialogs , violence, gore,action,emotions all things shown in appropriate proportions...this remains the best movie i have ever watched in my lifetime...nothing can beat godfather (except godfather 2)..but sincere performances by the whole cast of the film. Profits were so high for The Godfather that earnings for Gulf & Western Industries, Inc., which owned Paramount Pictures, jumped from seventy- seven cents per share to three dollars and thirty cents a share for the year"
4781,False,"This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability."
4782,False,"Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies spinned off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can't. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a clich√©. His performance though was not a clich√©. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.The horse's head, the scene of Brando running with his groceries, the coffee shop scene, ""I'll give him an offer he can't refuse"" and countless other scenes and quotes from this movie have become a part of our culture. These scenes and lines have been recycled over and over again in comedies, commercials, etc. that it is impossible to avoid the greatness of The Godfather. The Godfather is like a disease once you see it you fall in love with it. I don't know if it is the greatest movie ever but it is definitely the most iconic film ever made."
4783,False,"I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him."
4784,False,"This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants. The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.Do not miss this film!"
4785,False,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing.  It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well.  Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses.  Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life.  This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable."
4786,False,"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy"
4787,False,"Engrossing motion picture that features some of the finest editing, cinematography and performances ever. There is a wonderful theme of family that runs through this film and its later sequels. No one is truly judged. Love is unconditional. God is the one who truly judges. Easily, the word masterpiece describes this film, but that's been said by so many...Who am I to argue? Masterpiece is right on the money."
4788,False,"Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating"" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out"" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film."
4789,False,"The Godfather is one of the most iconic films in cinema history. There are three points in the film that made it stand alone: direction, acting, and writing. The direction of this film was great! Frances Fran Coppela really knows how to make a great film. Like Steven Spilberg, Peter Jackson, James Cameron, and so many others, he as list himself as one of the most greatest directors in Hollywood. He's my role model. The acting was terrible, just kidding! :) The Acting was amazing. Marlon Brando carries the anchor of this movie, but Al Pacino holds it carefully. The cast of this movie was a good example of cast chemistry. Great Cast! The Writing was awesome. Coppela knows what he is doing when he is writing a script to a major blockbuster hit. That's why he's my role model. The Godfather is one my favorite films of all time. I would recommend you see this movie. It's awesome."
4790,False,"One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.
For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.
What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred ""Goodfellas"". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.8/10"
4791,False,"First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.I thought ""The Godfather"" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don.""It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.6/10"
4792,False,"The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence. The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
4793,False,"Part of the reason that The Godfather has been so popular, is that on first viewing it really does seem to have something for everyone.  It's a thriller, it's a (fascinating) documentary on 'Mafia Code', and half way through, for 45 minutes, a tragic love story.For starters, the acting is sensational.  There are very few people on Earth that cannot identify Marlon Brando's whispering, horse voice and bulldog expression. It has become what is probably the most famous performance in Hollywood's history.  The appearance of Al Pacino in the starring role is also a highlight.  The other highlights are of course the 'sound bytes'. For anyone who has not scene this masterpiece, I will not give the more famous quotes away- but they will be instantly recognisable when heard.This movie is split into three parts- the crime of the family, and its consequences, the exile of Pacino, and the reunion of the family in which the characters carry out the parts of the plot which set us up for the sequel.My only criticism of this film is how long winded it is.  Virtually three hours long, it is so meticulous that it becomes very hard to digest.  While the sequel is very deep and thoughtful, this tries to balance intellect and action- and although to a certain extent it succeeds, you wonder if this film would be a more enjoyable experience if there was less discussion and plot details, and a few more thrills."
4794,False,"As an Films Studies student from London. Watching this film was one of the most exciting thrill that ever happened to me. The powerful use of script and the Cinematography used to shoot the scenes were perfect and powerful. The first sequence of the film grips the audiences attention that this is not about brutal murders or shooting people without reason but involves discipline and symbolises the role played by Vito Corleone as being like a senator or a president when people come to help. I have watched this film more than 20 times and still don't get bored of it. If you want to compare it with Citizen Cane or Scarface, you can't. Because its too artistic and a perfect film for a gangster/crime hybrid film. When Al Pacino's role changes the film creates more suspense and concern on how he would run the family, but everyone then believes in him and he then becomes the next Godfather.This film is one of the best film ever to be made. Perfect in the way it starts and subsequently the ending as well, if you haven't watch this film didn't understand the concept of it, then don't bother watching films. This is the best film ever to be made...10/10"
4795,False,"I remember distinctly the first time I saw ""The Godfather"". I was a child and it was being shown on broadcast television.  Granted, neither of theses are optimal conditions for rendering an informed opinion but I remember being struck with how unremarkable- in fact how boring I found the film.  I was particularly surprised by this, as there had been a great fanfare over the broadcast. I chalked this up to my own immaturity and thought no more of it.The second time I saw the film was in college.  My friend had a brother who was quite a film enthusiast and he, like many others, counted ""The Godfather"" as the finest film.  One evening my friend and I watched the film.  The viewing once again left me unimpressed.  I feigned an enthusiasm for the film that I did not feel, as it seemed the popular, and even the intellectual expectation.  Once again I associated my dislike for the movie with a failing in myself. I apparently did not appreciate a ""good movie"" when I saw one.Since that time I have seen many films, from many directors, from many countries, in many languages, and with varying budgets from independent offerings to mainstream Hollywood fare.  I certainly do not consider myself to be an expert but feel myself to be an informed member of an audience. Armed with my experience I recently viewed ""The Godfather"" again to expunge my previous failures and to gleefully join the ranks of Godfather sycophants.  Well, I think you know the outcome.  As they say in baseball, three strikes and you're out.I find the film to be completely un-redeeming in every way.  I do not have space to address the film systematically or technically so I will speak to my central grievance- the story is hollow.  There is no moral center.I do not demand that a movie have morality.  I do not demand that a film even have a point.  I can take a film at its face value for what it is.  A slapstick comedy is foolish and an action flick is mindless, I do not ask that they be a different movie- only that they meet the narrow definition to which they aspire.  The problem is that ""The Godfather"" aspires to be a great drama and that aspiration comes with high expectations.Gratuitous violence is expected in big-budget action flicks, amorality can be understood in the quiet desperation of an independent film's philosophy, and self-indulgence is to be expected in the over-the-top musical extravaganza.  However, violence, amorality, and self-indulgence in a film that portrays itself as mainstream drama or even tragedy are reprehensible. This is not art- it is base voyeurism at its worst.  We are standing in the bailey at New Castle or at the Coliseum watching with leering stares at the baseness and depravity of man. This film is not a criticism of man's foul nature, as in the above referenced independent film; it is a celebration of it.  Anyone who claims otherwise deludes himself.Thus conceived I can appreciate `The Godfather' as a film oddity, a curious victory of the popularity of evil men.  But to say that it is a great film is scandalous, and to say that it is the greatest film is blasphemous.  To say that the highest achievement of man in film is a celebration of cruelty, deception, and greed is a statement that many should reconsider.I find it interesting that many of those who claim ""The Godfather"" as their favorite film, or the best film of all time can count their viewings of the film on one hand. In fact, I myself (who thinks unfavorably of the film) have given the film more attention then many of the ""fans"" I know.  A friend of mine who professes to like the film recently returned the box-set DVD ""Godfather"" collection that he received for Christmas.  As he put it, he loved the film but when was he ever going to watch it?  That is faint praise indeed for the ""greatest film of all time"".I am sure there are those who genuinely enjoy the film, but you could say that about any movie.  I would advise those who fawn over this film so to ask themselves if their enthusiasm comes from within or from a modern mythology. ""The Godfather"" is a paper tiger."
4796,False,"I did get a little bored here and there. But this film is classic. A work of art that will be remembered forever, and I admire the acting. It's so wonderful and you see so many familular faces that you see today. I will never forget ""The Godfather"".9/10"
4797,False,"Does ""Godfather"" romanticize crime and criminals? Yes, it does. Take, for instance, the Godfather's name ""Corleone"" which translates as ""Lionhearted,"" suggesting that the heroes are to be compared to Richard the Lionhearted, legendary chivalrous hero of the Crusades and friend to Robin Hood. There can be no doubt that author Mario Puzo and director Francis Ford Coppola have made romantic idols of the Corleones, as the film gilds them with mystery, honor and gallantry. But of what Holy Crusade are the Corleones the leaders? Seemingly a war for survival against vicious enemies who would destroy their gang. But why should we care what happens to a bunch of evil criminals? ""Godfather"" is just as much interesting for what it fails to show the audience as what it does show. The film makers wrongly assume that the audience is sophisticated enough to infer the kind of lurid but educational scene that made such a great success of earlier gangster films, nitty gritty illustrations of the inside workings of organized crime: loan sharking, extortion and vice. ""Godfather"" for the most part ignores this subject matter, the everyday business of crime, in favor of what should be only the end part of its story: a war between gangs over control of the rackets. The drama is essentially without motivation. The movie is simply not interested in showing us much of the dirty business that is the reason for the war. That is because the heroes would seem much less chivalrous if their criminal enterprises were shown in any depth or with any real understanding. For most of its length, the movie plays as a revenge tragedy in which the gallant protagonists could be members of any great family (whether criminal or not) protecting their cherished honor.Why did the film makers deliberately sanitize the criminal aspect of the Corleone family? Are they apologists for crime? I think they are. One confidence game employed by the film makers, which is also familiar among the annals of organized crime leaders, is a variation on the trick called ""bait and switch."" We expect a portrait of a ruthless and immoral criminal, instead we are made to believe in the essential moral rightness of Don Corleone when he condemns as a contemptible enemy the kind of criminal who trades in narcotics. In other words, we are lured into the theater with the promise of a true to life depiction of the actions of a bad guy, and then the film makers slyly pull a fast one and show us a good guy instead! (We are persuaded to ignore the fact that the Godfather is an extortionist and pimp ¬ñ even worse we are asked to believe that extortion and pimping are not so bad, especially if practiced by an honorable guy like Don Corleone, who, whatever his failings, is much too decent to trade in narcotics.) This jiggery pokery was so effective that around the time the movie and its sequel came out an ivy league educated friend of mine on his way to a brilliant career on Wall Street bitterly denounced a critic of ""Godfather"" for making the claim that Don Corleone was not entitled to be regarded as a great hero like President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, General Douglas MacArthur or Doctor Albert Schweitzer, who had received similarly adulatory treatment in film. My friend, having seen both Godfathers, was convinced that a Mafia leader might be just as honorable as the heroic portrait the movies presented.So, I feel some need on this occasion to remind the public of what the Mafia does, even when they allegedly refuse to get involved in narcotics sales. The Mafia is mainly in the business of Vice. It feeds off the weaknesses of a mass of little people who are corruptible, who are vulnerable to the appeal of easy sex, cheap thrills, quick money and quick fixes of their problems. These little people pay for their vices all their lives, much more than they can afford to pay, and end up ruined for the greater glory of the Mafia. Most racket crime is not glorious; it is petty and mean and easily committed by anyone who has less courage or daring than the average person. But it's easy to understand why the film makers left this out of the movie. It would be kind of absurd to call a scuzzy dirtbag by the name ""Lionheart."""
4798,False,"Marlon Brando's acting as the Godfather is sublime and this film is worth watching for that.However I did find the film very long-winded and at times boring. I liked the slow progression of the storyline and understand why Francis Ford Coppola did the film in the way he did. It's just that I felt the film was lacking something. It could have done with a bit more excitement or suspense to make the film more gripping.Lets just say I watched this film about a year ago and I still haven't seen The Godfather 2, and I am in no hurry to either.7/10. Average film. Worth watching to say that you have seen it."
4799,False,"This movie is ridiculously overrated. It is merely a overly dramatized celluloid interpretation of life involved with the Italian Mafia. Yes, organized crime is a problem, but this movie is NOT all that amazing. There are entirely too many references to it in other movies, too many spoofs and too many quotes. It's a bad movie. Let it go. There is no real plot line and the bad accents were enough to give me a headache. This movie is mind numbingly boring. It feels as though I lose brain cells every time I am forced to watch this painfully shallow film. Most films following along a similar premise are horribly dull. Why does everyone rave about movies like this and Scarface? They are awful, overly exaggerated and generally badly constructed cinematic failures. A decent script and plot line were substituted for gratuitous blood, gore and explosions. A good movie starts with a good story and a good script, this lacks both. Every aspect of this movie was horribly boring. It does NOT deserve to be named ""The Best Movie of All Time."""
4800,False,"This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD."
4801,False,"OK, I see that the movie has many naysayers. I was one of them when I saw the film in 1972, and I was only fifteen at the time. I could go on and on about the film's myriad failures. It is contrived, self-important, at times even poorly staged. Which brings me to my point. A lot of people seem to forget that Coppola did not win Best Director-- Bob Fosse (for ""Cabaret') did, and deservedly so. He did a much better job. That is one of the eight Oscars that ""Cabaret"" won.The other seven just happen to be Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound, Editing,Original Score, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Actress. So when the time came to open the envelope and announce Best Picture, the Award goes instead to a film that, by that point, had won only two statues (for Actor and Adapted Screenplay). How does any movie win eight Academy Awards and fail to grab Best Picture? With that in mind, ""The Godfather"" is not merely arrogant film-making. Its history and legacy,both--just like its protagonists-- are just downright larcenous."
4802,False,"I continually fail to understand why The Godfather is hailed as ""The Greatest Movie of All Time"".  I've seen it twice--a second time just to make sure--and I have to tell you that I sat there in a stupor, bored out of my mind.  And I'm not a teenager raised on MTV; I'm in my 30s and am absolutely devoted to movies--I've seen as many classics (American & foreign) that I can get my hands on.  But, for me, The Godfather ranks alongside Singin' in the Rain as the most overrated films of all time. Singin' in the Rain, at least, I get (it's just my intense dislike for Donald O'Connor that makes me dislike this film).  But The Godfather?   It's just a bland epic about a bunch of moronic gangsters, with Marlon Brando giving a campy performance, and riddled with repulsive violence.  Give me a break.  The fact that this movie is so ""beloved"" has had the direct result that nowadays we got absurdly worse and worse films every year, created by clueless filmmakers."
4803,False,"""The Godfather"" is awesome. I could go on all day about all its strengths and why it is such a great movie. Instead I will comment on its weaknesses, or should I say weakness. It's too long. One thing that drives me nuts are movies that are a little bit too lengthy. Otherwise I loved everything about the Godfather.8 out of 10. (Pushing a 9)"
4804,False,"In a word, underwhelming. The Godfather is a decent film with some strong acting, but I did not find any exceptional or unique quality in the film that would render it a masterpiece. It's a simple a mob story in which everybody is an antagonist; the story is not gripping, the characters are hard to care about, the camera work is adequate but not in any way remarkable, the list goes on. I don't think The Godfather is a bad movie, but in no way is it the best I've ever seen, or anywhere close.The movie has been so hyped that I really was expecting to see the best movie all time when I watched it. What I saw was a decent flick with some very quotable moments, but in my mind the film has no singular or superior quality when compared to other great films. Monstrously overrated, but still a respectable movie."
4805,False,"There is always a risk when a film becomes a huge part of popular culture. So many of it's iconic moments and scenes are ripped off, riffed on, or parodied by countless shows and movies, that there is always a fear that the original will lose some of it's impact, and become comical and stale. The Godfather, however, disproves this. It is still a masterpiece, and always will be. The story-line proves once again how much the innocent public loves to view the lives of outright evil men, especially when they happen to be of the charming and charismatic variety. Let's look at the most iconic scene; a man chops off a horse's head, and leaves it in his owner's bed in order to scare him into submission. Oh yeah, he's one of the good guys though, so it's okay!Everything is explored in the Godfather, either directly or subtly; family politics, gangland negotiation, corrupt officials, there is no part of the mafia experience that is not pictured here, taken from the viewpoint of Michael, a character whose transition from unwilling family outsider and war-hero into the don himself really gives the film a unique perspective. Of course, for me, out of all the fantastic characters, the film is carried by Marlon Brando. There is something magnetic about his performance, a mixture of loving family man, ruthless career criminal, and sophisticated Sicilian gentleman, that is thrilling to watch. One of the all time greatest acting performances."
4806,False,"Does it even need to be said that The Godfather is an amazing film? Is there really any purpose at all in pointing out all the things which make it so wonderful? Everybody knows. Everybody will always know. This is a film which will live forever. The story, the performances, the cinematography, the music...all so perfect. And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic.There are so very many good reasons why this film will always be remembered so fondly. No matter how many times you see it the film never fails to make an impact. Even if you've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience. From the famous opening scene with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up. It's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise. Because initially it seems obvious that the story is about Don Vito Corleone. He is the Godfather after all. But, for as powerful a presence as Brando is, as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of Don Vito's son Michael, as played so wonderfully by Al Pacino. When Michael comes into his own the film, gripping from the start, becomes even more compelling. Has any character in any film evolved more than Michael Corleone does here? The Michael we meet at his sister's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end. And what a performance by Pacino, changing along with his character. What a journey it is for Michael as his story unfolds. And it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it.Brando and Pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri. And that is just scratching the surface. There are so many memorable characters. And what a world Coppola has created for these characters to inhabit. The film has a unique look and feel to it. The world of The Godfather is quite unlike any other, often imitated but never duplicated. It's a triumph in every sense for Coppola. But perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the Corleones. We know right from the start that Don Vito Corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things. But we identify with him anyway. And one cannot help but feel for Michael as he is inexorably pulled into the family business.Everyone has their favorite Godfather characters, favorite moments, favorite lines. The film has become a cultural touchstone. And as it continues to be discovered by new generations it seems that the film, if possible, actually continues to grow in stature. It is a classic film which stands the test of time. The Godfather has earned its place of honor in the history of film. A true masterpiece."
4807,False,"This movie continues to be praised, but when I rented it I only made it through 45 minutes before I stopped the video.  There aren't many movies that are so bad I don't watch the whole thing, but ""The Godfather"" is that bad.  I don't care how much other people may like it.  I still say it sucks,sucks,sucks,sucks,sucks,sucks,sucks..."
4808,False,"Up until today, I haven't bothered to review ""The Godfather"". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience."
4809,False,"I follow recommendations on this site highly. I rented this movie and wanted my money back. Ever been to one of those parties with distant relatives where you don't know anyone there and just sit in the corner waiting for it to end?  If so, you've seen 90% of this movie. Throw in a few good scenes that happen so far apart, you forget the last one by the time you see the next one. Might be worth watching once just to say you have, but you'll probably never watch it again. Definitely not ""best movie ever material."""
4810,False,"...""The Godfather"", as everyone knows, is a classic.  It follows the Corleone family over a period of a few years in the forties.  It starts with godfather Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and ends with godfather - and Vito's son - Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).  Also involved are Sonny Corleone (James Caan), adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and muscle Peter Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) to name a few.The acting ensemble is one of the greatest put together in film history. Brando plays the wise Vito Corleone very well, but the best performances come from Pacino as Michael and Caan as Sonny.  Pacino is probably the greatest character actor of all time, and this film shows it.  He plays Michael at the start with a young naivety and is able to bring the character along to the end of the film, where he shows the growth of Michael's knowledge and wisdom.  Unfortunately, Caan is only in about half the movie, but he certainly does an incredible job as the hot tempered Sonny.""The Godfather"" is the template for good drama.  Few films achieve it's greatness, but in the end, it is surely not the best.  In my opinion, there is no best movie of all time, but many 'best' films per genre.  ""The Godfather"" is the best crime drama.  ""Casablanca"" is the best romance.  ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" movies are the best adventures.  All of said movies would tie, and be equal in greatness.So, if you're ever tired of these days' mindless action and mediocre drama films, then pop in one of the classics.  Any one will do, they are all equally entertaining.  Films like ""The Godfather"", ""Casablanca"", ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" are the reason movies are so popular.Enjoy, 9/10."
4811,False,"No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy combined.Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. ""The Godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, ""The Godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.My Grade--- Part I: A Part II: B Part III: C-"
4812,False,"The Godfather movie series is the best that I have ever seen. It's really joy and fun and exciting to watch the movie all over again. I really enjoy the first part the most, but I think the second part is very interesting and adds lots of elements to part one. I wish the Godfather was a whole new TV series, that dose extend beyond three parts. I enjoy the excellent acting, story, and drama. I can't say enough about the music. It's something that many people enjoy listening to on regular bases. Overall I would rank this movie top notch on my list. Highly recommended. have seen The Godfather movies too many times to count. It's part of the lexicon in my family, we quote lines from it all the time in regular conversation. So, I thought this book might be a little boring, just because I already knew the story so well. Not the case! The book adds so much detail to the story that I think I'll be watching the movie again soon in a whole new light. Joe Mantegna does such a wonderful job narrating this story and I'd absolutely recommend his version as opposed to the other full cast version that's out there, especially for people that are really in tune with the movie."
4813,False,"he Godfather (1972) did for gangster movies what 2001: A Space Odyssey did for science fiction. Like Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola re-energized and, to a degree, reinvented a basic Hollywood pulp fiction action-entertainment genre, using it as a vehicle for the high artistic ambitions of a post-New Wave film ""auteur."" Within his narrower focus on 20th century American civilization (as opposed to Kubrick's philosophical speculations on human evolution), Coppola shapes the story of the Corleone Mafia family into an epic/satiric vision of American business, government, justice, and moral decline. The Godfather's brilliantly constructed opening sequence, the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter, not only establishes the Don's character, the nature of his organization, the role of family and Sicilian tradition in his world, and the character of his sons (three natural and one adopted), but also establishes the relationship between the Don's world and ""legitimate"" society. For instance, the film's opening words are those of Bonasera, a petitioner for a wedding ""favor,"" whose voice over a dark screen first asserts the American Dream, ""I believe in America. America has made my fortune,"" and then turns to disillusioned contradiction: ""for justice, we must go to Don Corleone.""Numerous subsequent lines of dialog establish literal or metaphorical connections between the criminal underworld and social institutions. Some of the most memorable ones include: ""My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator.""""Now we have the unions, we have the gambling; and they're the best things to have. But narcotics is a thing of the future. And if we don't get a piece of that action, we risk everything we have. I mean not now, but ten years from now."" ""It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business."" And most famously of all: ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" The film's title refers to two godfathers, the original Don Corleone and his youngest son - and ultimate successor - Michael. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Corleone, for which he was awarded a Best Actor Academy Award, balances the Don's subtly counter-pointed functions as beloved, grandfatherly patriarch and fearsome, brutal crime boss. Yet Michael, as the character most centrally and significantly affected by the film's plot and played with a brilliance equaling Brando's by a then unknown Al Pacino, is the principal protagonist.At the wedding, Michael's centrality is signaled by the Don's frantic call, ""Where's Michael? We are not taking the picture without Michael!"" A World War II hero still in decorated uniform, Michael is meanwhile busy differentiating himself from his family to his girl friend and future second wife, Kay (Diane Keaton). ""Luca Brasi held a gun to the band leader's head,"" he relates, ""and my father assured him that either his signature or his brains would be on the release. That's my family Kay. It's not me."" Michael's initial disinterest in Mafia activities is reinforced by his adoring father who envisions him as ""Senator Corleone"" or ""Governor Corleone"" not as his successor. That role is reserved for his hot-headed eldest son, Sonny (James Caan). But, of course, events conspire to suck Michael in - and to keep sucking him in right through Godfather III - the assassination attempt on his father, Michael's coolly murderous response, the car bomb meant for him that kills his first wife, the Sicilian beauty Apollonia (aptly named for the god of sun light), the riddled body of his brother Sonny. Inevitably, a morally darkened Michael emerges at the end of the film, one who outdoes his father in guile and ruthlessness and whose final brutal and deceitful acts in Godfather I seal his doom as a Macbeth-like villainous tragic hero.Shot mainly on location in various New York City locales, The Godfather spans a ten- year post World War II period. A multitude of props, costumes, and pop culture artifacts arranged by the film's art director, Warren Clyner, and production designer, Dean Tavoularis, lend a rich sense of historical authenticity to the film's mise en scene. Moreover, the film's lighting by brilliant cinematographer Gordon (""prince of darkness"") Willis, contributes greatly to both the film's realism and its thematic symbolism. Compare, for instance, the use of extremely dark, shadowy, color desaturated interior scenes ¬ñ especially in the Don's home office ¬ñ with the brightly lit, vivaciously colored outdoor wedding scene or the sun-drenched, romanticized Sicilian landscape.The Godfather is edited in the classic Hollywood invisible style, subordinating technique to the needs of narrative and visual continuity. But the film is expertly edited nonetheless. In particular one might note the stunning use of multiple parallel editing that occurs in one of the film's last scenes: the assassination of the other crime family heads, elaborately planned to coincide with Michael's participation in the baptism of sister Connie's child. Likewise, The Godfather's soundtrack is a memorable combination of diegetic period music (""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"") and a lush, operatic original score composed by one of the greatest film music composers, Nino Rota (a frequent Fellini collaborator as in 8 1/2).With The Godfather and its even more ambitious sequel, Coppola pushed the classic gangster film in the direction of high art and released it once and for all from the moralistic grip of the Hays Code, which arose in the 1930s in large part as a response to the romanticizing of criminals found in such early examples of the gangster genre as Scarface, Little Cesar, and Public Enemy. Not only did the code regulate the degree and nature of sexual and violent imagery in all films, but it also specifically required that criminals be portrayed as morally repulsive social deviants and that plots involving them be resolved with the implicit or explicit lesson that ""crime did not pay."" Fortunately for American popular culture The Godfather radically rewrote the rulebook and paved the way for a generation's-worth of gangster masterpieces ranging from the Scarface remake to Pulp Fiction to The Sopranos."
4814,False,"No one ever brings up a big detail about this movie: It's plain, the story goes on straightly, it's SIMPLE. The genius isn't something over-complicated and weird in an awful movie, it's something simple turned into a masterpiece. Everything is just perfect, the acting, the dialogues, the characters and their evolution (even (rare) stereotypes work perfectly and they fit with the atmosphere), the shots, the cinematography, the music that not only fits but it's never distracting... It's not something particular that made this movie great, it's the perfect chemistry between the elements. It's slow but never boring. It's better than the book, in fact (at least for me). So this is my little tribute to one of the greatest movie ever, and this is only my point of view."
4815,False,"First time i saw this movie i did not understand the actual realty of movie and characters acting was speech less. Rest i can said when i saw and understand this movie after my 5th 100% successful attempt to watch full movie then i realize this was the awesome movie i need to buy original, and well be in my personal collection . Currently my family and my friends also buy the original blue ray of this movie very hard to find a seller because all want this one to their collection part.fabulous acting, superb story and played with characters am speechless. We all knows we well not again see to like this kind of level of movie in any decades hats off to all super actors in the movie."
4816,False,"The movie is phenomenal, is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 40 years after its release. It takes its subjects seriously, bestowing legitimacy upon the internecine power struggles of the Mafia normally reserved for classical themes in high art. There is something deeply resonant in the film's treatment of filial piety, the need for respect, and our culture's abiding interest in the parallel moral universe of the Mafia. Just the best."
4817,False,"Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If a film is about Jewish mobsters, it's a ""Jewish Godfather""; if it's about the Chinese underworld, it's an ""Oriental Godfather""; if it takes place in contemporary times, it's a ""modern day Godfather"".If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it."
4818,False,"One of the best movies I have ever see, and I love it everything about this movie. Nothing in this movie is too much, every scene in the movie is perfect. The movie is with best cast ever, best directing, good story. It is about crime, family and their relationship. The best thing about it is that movie don't have any flaw. The best way to describe it is with word MASTERPIECE. When movie is in parts I, II ... often only first part is good and others bad, but it is not case with this movie. It's 40 years old movie, and still one of the best, I thing that information tells a lot. Don't miss this movie, because most of you will watch it again and again. :D"
4819,False,"This has to be a masterpiece for me and for my understanding and knowledge. I adore mob films like this one and TV series about the mob as the great TV series I've ever watched: The Sopranos. The shooting of the whole film is sublime, and the shots of the two sequels as well. Coppola got to manage this as a master of film composing. The plot and the development in general is majestic too. The scene of the head horse in the film director's bed is very shocking; I never saw something like that. Now I can only say that this has become one of my favorites films ever (for me and for most of you who are reading this). This is the sort of films that I would watch for many times."
4820,False,"No one can deny this movie being one of the (if not THE) greatest movies ever made. It is brilliant. Great performances by an amazing cast (that was controversial among the studio), beautiful music, brilliant directing of course, cinematography to die for and a storyline that fascinated me from the very first to the very last minute. The movie goes deep into the family and lets you be part of a dramatic journey. I would definitely recommend this movie to ANYONE. It is one of my all time favourite movies and I can watch it over and over again, finding more and more beauty in it every time. It is sad that many friends my age have never seen this movie."
4821,False,"Excellent film, from the opening to the end you sense a genuine touch into lives of the characters and the world created by the actors and Coppola.Just the intro of the movie immediately reveals the world you've entered and in the next few scenes you familiarized with family which shows who they are at heart.Personally, I love a movie that takes the time to deliver a well told story and The Godfather does just that - the scenes revealing the inner struggles of the characters, the conflict in matters regarding their world, and how each character deals with issues is well done.When a movie makes all their scenes have significant impact so much so that you don't find yourself wanting to pick favorites, you know you're dealing with greatness.From beginning to end I was immersed, and if you like well done movies I'm sure you'll experience the same."
4822,False,"So at first I always heard from a lot of people when I was younger that Godfather was the most epic movie of all time, I always memorized Vito Corleone's face when I was a kid... Years later I decided it's time I watch this movie and I did it on Netflix. Oh, and when I did, it was so good...The sharp chemistry is what makes up most of the stuff, these actors always just transcend and transcend so much. Vito Corleone is one of the best movie characters ever. And the performances? These actors gave one of the best performances of all time. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is arguably his best performance ever. I can't say enough of Marlon Brando. Do I need to state the obvious? He is the best for a reason. I would go on forever on Godfather and why it is my favourite movie of all time, but that would be more than 1,000 words. If you haven't watched this, give it a try and see to yourself - a masterpiece.What ALSO makes the godfather so special is it's line of who is a hero and a villain, can one really call a calm guy like Vito Corleone a bad guy? Technically he should be because, well because.. He is, a good... bla bla bla, it all just goes into your mind and it challenges you. I always saw Vito as a hero, but as Godfather grew more on me, I thought he was more like an Anti-hero. As for Michael, he will always be an anti hero in my opinion. Godfather gives out the most blend and epic characters in fiction history ever, let alone movies."
4823,False,"I have rated over a 100 movies in IMDb and none of them could get a 10/10 score, but this. I think that perfect score was waiting for me to watch this movie. This movie that has set a benchmark for me to rate other movies, ""Is it The Godfather level good or not ?"".This movie for me is an epitome of perfection, it scores a perfect score in almost all the departments, be it direction, acting, music, screenplay, character development, cinematography etc. I just couldn't find a fault with it (and mind you I tried really hard).With a blazing canon of actors which include Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall this film pierces right through you and makes a place for itself. Even days after you watch this movie you will find yourself, in your own private moments, speaking out those wonderful lines, trying to copy Vito Corleone or shape your voice like Michael Corleone. In its own mysterious ways the movie will sure remain with you.It leaves you wanting more, not because there are questions that remain unanswered, but because this film feels so good that you never want to leave it, leave the streets of New York or the Godfather's mansion. All in all Francis Ford Coppola has done a remarkable job that, in the least, deserves a standing ovation and an unanimous cheer of ""Bravo!"". This movie leaves you with an aftertaste of knowing that you have cherished watching an excellent movie."
4824,False,"This was a classic for me when I saw it for the first time, later I made all of my family watch it, we became true la Familia ;) not really a crime syndicate, but rather we loved what we saw in this film. I think this one is the best of the three parts and it is a timeless classic.I think Marlon Brando really deserves the Oscar for his role in this film, just as the film deserves other Oscars that it won.It is hard to add more laudeamus about this film that has already been written, I will let you read other reviews which I read which makes it so interesting to read. I will leave you with a question. How much of this could happen in the real life? I will leave you to wonder."
4825,False,"The few ""perfect"" films to ever been released are so perfect in every aspect that each scene almost feels like a masterpiece on its own. In the case of Coppola's revolutionary The Godfather, this statement holds especially true. Phenomenal and sheer brilliance in every aspect that cannot be matched by modern ""cinema"", Coppola's The Godfather is cinematic perfection in every aspect of filmmaking. From performances delivered by an astounding ensemble cast, to Nina Rota's breathtakingly soaring and epic musical score to Coppola's very direction, The Godfather should essentially be viewed as a three hour masterclass on filmmaking for any aspiring filmmakers. So perfect in every aspect and so free of flaws, no film since its time has matched even half the brilliance of The Godfather."
4826,False,"It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great. The Godfather lives up to the term masterpiece. A defining film in the history of cinema, ""The Godfather"" introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits. ""The Godfather"" is highly regarded as the greatest American movie of all-time. No other movie has garnered such praise as this movie has. Undoubtedly, everything has been meticulously put together to create an entertaining, captivating, and phenomenal masterpiece. Starring the best actor of all times (this movie can prove it), Marlon Brando, the rebellious prodigy, who electrified a generation and forever transformed the art of screen acting.You can't miss this movie."
4827,False,"The Godfather is an endless movie. No matter the age in which it has been discovered or the number of times you have seen it, this is a work that does not lose its ability to fascination and mystery. The problem is how to talk about it not limited to the amount of praise that his expertise justifies either the wonderful performance of Brando as Don Vito Corleone is evoked (note modulation of dialogues and play with the cat in the three interviews of the first sequence: all his character is defined), the tormented role Pacino as Michael Corleone (is a war hero who works they require to take their place in the crime family), the impulsive character of James Caan, with its counterpart in reflective Tom Hagen who plays Robert Duvall or accuracy of the smallest side, corresponding to names as Italian as Sollozzo and Tattaglia.The ribbon structure wise, it does not feel his nearly three hours, is also exemplary. It could be considered that The Godfather is organized around collective sequences religious-family: marriage of Connie (the only sunny sequence of the film to the Sicilian intermediate achieved), the justly celebrated baptism-slaughter, disease and death (the Don Vito was playing with his grandson among the vines, is another anthology moment) and the rest comes down to await the arrival of the violence, unrelenting brutality from the shooting of Sonny at the foot of the house (a tribute Coppola to Arthur Penn's Bonnie & Clyde) to the ""premiere"" of Michael in the restaurant. There riddled bodies, stabbed, dismembered, strangled or blunt: a kind of feast of degraded meat, without which there is no mafia ""order."""
4828,False,"People always say America is a big melting pot, but actually it is not actually like that. America is separated by different communities,the WASP, the catholics, Jewish people, the Asian, and the black people.Italian immigrants belong to the catholics,but they are looked down upon by some other European immigrants,so they have to ask help from their godfather, the mafia. This film is really impressive.Don Coleone is really a good father, his elder son has a bad temper, his second son is weak, his younger son is intelligent ans unique.This is a big family,this family culture is deeply rooted in their brains.This film is a mirror of Italy society:Power, Women and Money. There is a lot of media reports about Italy PM ex-PM Belusconi, why this corrupt PM not sacked even he faces lots of charges? People always say America dream, but the reality is cruel. If you want to make fortune, you must have support from your relations even the mafia.The wealth is controlled by a few people, they make their money through their relations become richer.This is Capitalism."
4829,False,"This film has spawned so many gangster clich√©s and parodies that it's not even funny. Every time you've heard of people ""sleeping with da fishies"" or ""making an offer you can't refuse,"" it'll all boil back to this classic, highly-tutted film.On first glance, I dismissed the film as being rather dull, despite a few standout moments. On repeat viewings, I have found it more compelling. The film is most memorable for the scenes everybody knows and loves: the scene with the horse's head, the street fighting scene, Marlon Brando's mumbling, the restaurant shooting, sporadic bursts of gunfights and violence...it's all there. Dialogue dominates most of the film, but when given due attention, the story can be rather gripping and mesmerizing. At this point, the only drag I've felt is in the last thirty minutes or so; the film just kinda winds down after nearly 150 minutes of epic-scale gangster mayhem.The story is long, dense, and chock full of quality characterizations. The film does a fine job of keeping its events in order so that the politics of each situation makes some kind of sense. What matters the most will be the characters, who are endearing, and the underlying themes of family, honor, and loyalty. Family and generations are probably the most blatant themes, especially since most scenes show some strong contrast (or perhaps comparisons) between adults and children.As a film, it looks really classy. Photography never was a huge standout for these films, but the sepia tones and framing lends the movie a type of classic family-portrait appeal. Editing is decent. Acting is probably the biggest virtue here. Marlon Brando chews the scenery, despite his mumbling and constant fiddling with things, he does show endless nuance and expressions that brings Vito Corleone to life really well. Al Pacino must be at his most nuanced as Michael, and the rest of the magnificent cast fulfills their parts well. Writing is decent. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes, and is especially noteworthy for its period reproduction. Music is nice too.Everybody should see this at least once in their lifetime.4/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Good | Film: Perfect)"
4830,False,"""The Godfather"" has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. Is that a fair assessment? After re-watching the film recently, I'd say yes.The 'godfather' of the title is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the aging head of the Corleone crime family. His time is coming to an end and some of his rivals would like to precipitate that end. When an attempt is made on the Don's life his sons follow in their father's footsteps as they seek to silence their enemies and protect the family interests.The Oscar-winning script was co-written by director Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, the author of the original novel. While trimmed significantly from the novel the film still clocks in at two hours and forty-five minutes. The film progresses at a stately pace and features countless classic scenes.Coppola's direction received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and so did Nino Rota's score (at least until it was deemed ineligible). Gordon Willis' cinematography is good (but not great) and the film's evocation of the 40's & 50's is both attractive and authentic.As for the actors, Marlon Brando was rewarded with his second Best Actor Oscar for his iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone. Al Pacino was nearly as good in his role as Vito's youngest son but he had to settle for a nomination in the supporting category. He had good company, though, since James Caan and Robert Duvall were also nominated. Any one of these three performances would have been Oscar-worthy. There were also several memorable performances in smaller roles from the likes of John Cazale, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden and others.Is ""The Godfather"" the best American film of all time? Personally, I don't think so but I wouldn't rank it too far from the top. In any case, this is one of those films that every movie lover should see."
4831,False,"For mafia members murders are nothing but business. They never kill for pleasure. Only in case of need, cold revenge or even summary justice (punishment of traitors for instance). Besides this they all have normal family lives with most cherished spouses and children and are usually very religious making pompous wedding, christening and funeral ceremonies in the Church or under priests' directions. This reality and atmosphere is splendidly shown in this movie that Coppola directed in a superb way and with a competent and strong hand. The cast has a stupendous performance. Marlon Brando plays a magnificent part in the role of the old godfather of one of American powerful mafia families, mastering his intonation and facial expression effectively thus creating an unforgettable character in the history of cinema. The action unfolds itself along the movie in a very captivating way. I want to stress particularly the sequence of the christening in which the new family godfather (Al Pacino) makes all the oaths in the name of the child (of whom he is also the Catholic godfather) and before the priest while a parallel cut shows us all the time a series of murders of rival mafia chiefs that were taking place at same time in several other places and which had been ordered by himself. The contrast of the religious scene and the violence of the killings is really impressive and full of meaning. This is maybe the best movie about mafia ever made."
4832,False,"Many men has called this the greatest movie ever made. I disagree, though I liked it very much. The hype of this movie is as interesting as the movie itself as it says a lot about the world we live in and the men who seek power. I have seen and read intimidation used by people, trying to personally attack any who called this movie terrible or boring calling them stupid, while many other just jumped on the wagon calling it the greatest movie ever made to avoid such attack. A similar pattern to how physically strong, but emotionally weak men like Capone and Hitler came to power.The movie is significant to both world and film history. I however only give the movie a 5 as by todays standard its less artistic, entertaining and original. I also did not feel there was much new or original to learn from this movie and I did not get that ""wow"" feeling. I would not have much interest to see it again.This is one of my favorite gangster movies though and its certainly not terrible or boring. However it lacks in much of what I think a great movie should be such as: Moral points, emotion, surprise, humor, editing, cinematography, original thought, special effects, music score or even acting.(the tough guy role is not as challenging as it is to play mentally ill person) It does also not appeal to a very broad audience (not a movie many women and children like). It was great for its time, but compared to some of todays movies is very limited in the areas of greatness.If you like movies like old gangster movies or even tough guy movies like ""the departed"" and ""scarface"" or want to know what the hype is about. I recommend this movie it is a great movie for this genre. But it does not reach the emotional or theatrical heights of movies like ""Forrest Gump"", ""the Lord of the Rings"", ""Dances with Wolves"" or even my favorite gangster movie ""Goodfellas""."
4833,False,"From the opening credits, you become completely immersed in the world of the Godfather. One of this film's greatest strengths is the pure power of the culture surrounding it. When you watch it, you feel like the society and the people in have descended from generations of people who have been in the ""business"".The acting is nothing less than sensational and the music accentuates and complements the film beautifully.Not much else can be said of perfection.This film is a must-have for anyone who professes to watch movies and is a required viewing for cultural education."
4834,False,"New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business. Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's. Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather. So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos. An all-time classic."
4835,False,"There isn't a gangster film out there bigger or better than The Godfather. It's hard to some it up in a few words, but here goes. At the centre of this film is the family. The Corleone family, headed by Vito (Marlon Brando), a.k.a. The Don, or The Godfather. His daughter's wedding tells us all we need to know about the Corleone's; key individuals, small but incredibly thought out sub-plots and a running theme of business and personal matters never mix. The Godfather is based on the simplest of foundations. Love thy family. Think before you act. Never betray your own. Vito attempts to keep the peace between the crime families. When things go south Vito's youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) gets involved. Michael's innocence is torn apart as he takes control of the family business.With every view comes a new discovery, a piece of the puzzle missed the last time round. The Godfather is a labyrinth waiting to be deciphered. Brando is sublime. He's able to radiate warmth and coercion with the smallest of reactions. It sets up careers for James Caan and Robert Duvall, who're brothers with dissimilar attitudes. The best is to come for Pacino, as this first part in a trilogy only shows his potential. The Godfather is a one of the most intense gangsters films you're ever likely to see."
4836,False,"THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all."
4837,False,"Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a Mafia family. Sonny (James Caan) is his eldest and heir apparent. Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWII hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough. It has to have cultural significance and some originality. That is 'The Godfather'. It is still being referenced today. May all the haters sleep with the fishes."
4838,False,"It starts with a wedding. In this well-observed period set-piece there's a nuclear microcosm of the Corleone business - the family - their relationships, characters and roles. The family is both the backbone and burden of capo Vito Corleone's businesses, both licit and nefarious. They are support and affection in a world where betrayal and isolation are twin reapers, yet the sibling rivalry, disaffection and simple disinterest are equal and ever present threats. The Godfather is the story of the self-perpetuating tragedy of this dysfunctional bond of business and family; a grand study of ever-encroaching existential claustrophobia out and inside the home, teamed with dramatic, reactionary Italian hot-headedness.Coppola tells this story with operatic intensity and sweep, conjuring dramatic tension, indelible cinematic images and earnest melodrama. He has one of the great casts - names that became - including Marlon Brando's greatest performance since his work for Elia Kazan in the 1950s. Nino Rota's score is not only celebrated by association but is a perfect compliment to the film, at once stark, woeful and, on blossoming, radiant. 9.5/10"
4839,False,"The Godfather soaks us up so dry it never has to hustle through. There is something in the deliberate journey of time as Don Corleone entrusts his reins of power that would have made an hour-and-forty-minute-long thriller unbecoming. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you understand merely by the way they exchange looks, or don't, or speak to each other. We are inclined to associate with Don Corleone's family not because we enjoy their gang wars, but because we have been with them from the opening, where they celebrate a wonderful wedding full of old Italian songs, dances and love, and later we watch them await violence while sitting at the kitchen table and eating the pasta cooked by Clemenza.Endowed with Nino Rota's immortal, extraordinary music score, this consummate masterpiece is entitled The Godfather, a title not only relevant because of the wise Don Vito Corleone, who heads his family with unruffled effectiveness, but also to his son Michael, a hesitant college graduate who is in the beginning feeling shame of his criminal background and firm on living the life of an upright citizen. Coppola follows Michael's ascent to power within the family, on top of the concurrent wearing away of his heart.Vito Corleone himself is not even the central character in the drama. He is a relaxed puppeteer. The central character, really, slowly comes to be the youngest, smartest son, Michael, who absorbs the spirit of his father's standing while reworking his outdated customs. The Godfather's function in the family enterprise is illustrated by his name, existing outside the following generation which will continue and, with any luck, point the family into legal endeavors. Marlon Brando, who plays Vito as a perceptive, resilient model family man in his wise latter years, in fact has the character lead whereas Al Pacino, as Michael, is the lead. Unhurried and physically at ease, one knows his reaction would be of great anger if he were to be harassed. In the face of his grooming, which is given the least effort needed for a good, attractive look, there's a look about him as if he's just awakened, and that first groggy morning hour is the time he always seems to be stuck within. His presence is imprinted with a brooding, nonchalant style. Smooth and understated, he musters a searing inner fire that makes his tremendous character arc so impactful and amazing. But Brando's performance, as always, is expertly offhand, and it earned him an Oscar. His voice and physicality consciously lack precision, and the incidental result is of a man so at home with power that he no longer needs to prompt anyone.The remaining actors furnish one case-in-point after another of superb, instinctive casting. Macho and tempestuous James Caan and pragmatic and down-to-earth Robert Duvall, for instance, hardly have to act to embody their roles. While this, the quintessential crime drama, is an extensive, painstakingly thorough film of nearly three hours, there genuinely isn't time to go into the personal history and distinctiveness of such characters as Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the hardened, heavyset family lieutenant, Jack Woltz (John Marley, who was excellent in Faces), the movie baron, Luca Brasi, the faithful contract killer, McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), the corrupt cop, and the rest. Coppola meets this issue head-on with unassuming typecasting. A character who appears in a story long enough to say hello and goodbye, no matter how small, better be real enough that you can assume who he votes for.Really, the opening wedding sequence deeply familiarizes us with the dynamics of the family, an authoritarianism in the guise of Old World ceremony. Coppola asserts a style and a visual guise that is quintessential, through Gordon Willis's reddish-brown tinted, overexposed cinematography, everything period furnishings.Men wearing black suits sitting in dark boardrooms parley the particulars of prostitution and gambling, and fashion an isolated society that issues stability and integrity, that is in terms of their own advantages. Politicians and policemen are merely intimidated or trafficked. Esteem and reliability are the legal tender, and all influence emerges from the Don, who calmly keeps quiet control over his territory.His successor is Santino, the Caan role, always cooking with implicit rage and is incredibly eager to inherit the position. His brothers are Michael and the sniveling pushover Fredo, played by the late John Cazale. The Duvall role is Tom Hagen, the unemotional, factual family lawyer and all-around professional shrewd pragmatist embraced by Vito as a child and brought up as his own. The women are not much more than background scenery. Vito's wife scarcely speaks or even appears. Sonny's wife suffers silently through his shameless infidelity, and the Corleone daughter, Connie, played by Talia Shire, is so often overlooked that her brothers take no notice of her unless she protests about her disgusting husband having beaten her.An assault on Vito's life alters Michael's attitude, and he comes back to help defend his family's wellbeing as Sonny takes rash control, making a mess of the business and laying everyone on the line, while the laid up and incapacitated Vito can do no more than look on. Michael's bona fide defining moment make its mark in one of the film's most unforgettable scenes of ultimate virtuosity. He takes it upon himself to do a hit at a small Italian restaurant, using a gun that was left for him in a bathroom stall. This forces him into banishment in Sicily, where he solidifies his determination to return his family to a status of eminence."
4840,False,"I bought The Godfather: The Game and was sucked so deeply into it that I wanted to see the movies. My brother kept telling me about how the scenes in the movie played out and that alone was enough to make me buy the entire collection on DVD. I will never regret that decision so long as I live.The Godfather plays out like a documentary with out the corny voice over. The actors in this movie do such a great job it feels as though you aren't watching a movie but are instead watching the individual lives play out. There isn't a plot that can be fingered out. If you had to it would be the war between all the families and the cause of it.Don Vito Corleone is approached by a member of the Tattaglia family to form a deal between the two families in a new business venture: the selling of drugs. Don Corleone, a vigilant believer in the old ways, feels that getting into the business of drugs will draw too much heat. And because of this he refuses the offer that is placed before him.This fuels a fire with the Tattaglia family and it has a domino effect that causes wars between all of the families. The movie revolves around this central premise and comes to a head with the ending of the war. The outcome and what ends the war is also unpredictable and full of strategic writing. And I feel that the ending will surprise any body who doesn't already know how it all does.The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 is because although it is a very entertaining and among the best movies I've ever seen, I don't feel that it is THEE best. There are movies out there that will entertain all audiences and that are just as good. There are movies that I can watch with friends without them growing bored. It gets a 9 because, as much as I love this movie, I can admit that it will only entertain a certain kind of person. I know there are movies that don't have this restriction.A definite must buy for collectors; Make sure you like dramatic movies and not action movies though."
4841,False,"As much as i did enjoy this film, and was intrigued throughout, I still don't like to see it gain the repetitive status of 'the greatest movie of all time'. I feel a movie has to have a more relevant context than the glamourised lifestyle and crooked dealings of Italian-American mafia to gain such a grand title. However, admittedly, unlike 'The Goodfellas' for instance, 'The godfather' is not glamourised that much, and I'm thankful for Coppolla turning what was at times a tedious book into a 3 hour long gripping tale. I did enjoy the book, but it's lucky that Coppolla was the man who got his hands on it. He turned some of 'The Godfather''s sections into the most mind-bendingly gripping scenes ever.In a film genre that is incredibly overrated, 'The Godfather' certainly stands head and shoulders above the rest, however, i feel it's genre should forever hold it back from being THE greatest movie of all time."
4842,False,"Like I said: Definitely not the best movie ever. While the movie had its good points, I can't see why it's number 1 on IMDB. I don't even think it was better than Goodfellas, or even better than the other two movies I rented (American History X, Casablanca). Oh well, still good entertainment, looking forward to Godfather Part II."
4843,False,"Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's  but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best.  Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever.To sum up, The Godfather is sensational. A fine film from a fine filmmaker."
4844,False,I saw this movie when it first came out in the movie theaters.  It was the first movie I seriously considered walking out of.  Up to that point in my life I had never fidgeted so much in a movie.  I blame the director - his pacing was so ponderous that the story seemed to go on and on and I could hardly wait for it to be over. The whole Godfather series is vastly overrated.
4845,False,"A mate of mine loves this film, and the whole genre to boot. He made me watch this, instilling in me the notion that it was the second best film ever, behind its sequel. Im glad I watched it, if only to argue with my mate. This film is overrated. It's good but not good enough for a top ten spot, especially when there are better films of its genre out there. Goodfellas comes to mind, and I even found Casino more entertaining.Basically, I like a film which leaves me thinking about it, and moved. This didn't really do either. Apparantly the sequel is better. I hope so."
4846,False,"Pretty good, but a bore at times. The plot was very good and has some turns, but overall the story unfolded very slowly. Only the actors did a great job to save the day. I was also very impressed by the music, when you closed your eyes, the music alone can put you in the story."
4847,False,"The Godfather is Franis Ford Coppolla's best work (next to Apocalypse Now) and is one of the best films I have ever seen. It shows a way of life not shown before this film was released and most likely it shocked them as much as it shocked me. The Acting (among many other things) highlight this film-noir/gangster/epic including Marlon Brando in his most recognizable performance ever as the man himself, Don Corleone, but also subtle work from breakthrough star Al Pacino and others like James Caan, Robert Duvall, and great bit parts for wonderful character actors like John Marley and Sterling Hayden.Corleone gets wounded and, by default through various 'circumstances' in the family (not least of which his ailing health) hands his ""business"" over to his ambivalent but cunning son, Michael (in a well done performance by Al Pacino). The film goes on long, but after watching it a few times, you hardly notice it at all. Every time ones watches this film it gets better because of noticing something small, something wildly creative, one didn't notice the last time and thanks to that it gets richer every time. With a beautiful score, terrific cinematography, and sublime directing and writing by Coppolla (with Puzo) this film belongs not only a place in film history, but in world history as well."
4848,False,"This movie has to be THE MOST OVERRATED MOVIE OF ALL TIME. i don't understand why everyone raves about this movie. it's boring, the acting is shallow and weak, the whole premise is annoying, and i had to fight off sleep 3 times to finish this ""movie"". This movie has two layers. Boring, barely audible speech, and explosions. I didn't think it to be possible, but even the EXPLOSIONS were boring. Where does the fascination for this movie come from? Marlon Brando may have been a good early actor, but this ""i'll make him an offer he can't refuse"" old man voice is so irritating i almost threw the DVD out the window, however, the movie ended up numbing all my extremities so that it was impossible to move as i had no choice but to sit on in horror. I'm sorry i ever wasted my time on this piece of garbage. With a weak premise, ludicrous character designs, and a plot that could cure insomnia, Godfather sleeps with the fishes, with a 1 out of 10."
4849,False,"Let me just start by saying that I am 50% Italian. I have nothing against Mafia movies. In fact, I have nothing against ANY type of movie. But, to say that this is the best movie of all time is simply insane.
I saw absolutely nothing special. I kind of enjoyed the performances of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, and James Caan... but besides that, there is not one really exceptional feature in sight. And the fact that it is one hour too long only brought down my enjoyment. It's not the worst film of all time... but not the best either."
4850,False,"Without a doubt, this is a good film. It's got great acting all around, a fine musical score, the cinematography is practically flawless; but it is still lacking in the most important area:It's still a movie that glorifies (or attempts to do so) the mafia.Yes, this film is *really* about family and loyalty, but in the end that becomes sort of sublimated and what you have is a story about criminals, the massive power they wield, and the destruction they cause to those around them.Hardly something worthy of praise. The Godfather is an interesting film, but it's hardly a great film."
4851,False,"The godfather is one of those movies i never get tired of watching,its a classic Mob movie,Francis ford Coppola directed this gem with great acting by Marlon Brando,jimmy caan,AL pacino,Robert duvall,Diane Keaton, and john cazale.its a violent,gritty and realistic account of a mafia family with Marlon Brando as don corleone,the big boss.this classic is often imitated but never topped.the story was written by Mario puzo, from his best selling novel.it also stars;Talia shire,Gianni Russo, lee strasberg,john Marley,Alex rocco,and Marianna hill.its an extremely long,a little over 3 hours,best seen uncensored.it was followed by 2 sequels.part 2 was very good,part 3 not so good.as an Italian American i can appreciate the godfather.it is one of a kind.10 out of 10."
4852,False,"The Godfather (1972)Number 1 - 1972Number 1 - 1970sTop 5 - All TimeAn offer you can't refuse ...The Godfather is considered one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps the best. Marlon Brando's perfect portrayal of Mafia boss Don Vito Corleone is simply unforgettable and one of the finest performances everFrancis Ford Coppola adapts Mario Puzo's superb novel in a breathtaking fashion.Upon its release in 1972, many people knew that something special was expected - the result, one of, if not the greatest and superior film of all time. I won't sit here defending this colossal masterpiece, it needs no such thing. The Godfather is the definitive inside to the operations, bonds and thoughts of the Mafia. Only one other film manages to give us a breathtaking panorama of the Mafia and that is Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas'. Every gangster film is measured alogn the breadth of The Godfather:'The best gangster film since The Godfather'Coppola has created something so powerful, so unique that essentially cemented a whole new genre of film-making. This film did not follow stereotypes, arguably it created them. Breathtaking direction, incomparable acting, one of the best screenplays in the history of film amount to one of the most memorable achievements in film history.-10/10-"
4853,False,"When a movie is listed at No. 1 on the IMDb, and when this same movie is ranked No. 3 by the AFI, it has got to be a good film. And no one doubts that is what The Godfather is. Indeed, the acting is incredible, the directing awesome, the plot good and the climax shocking and beautiful.Overall the movie is great, surely deserving a place in the Top 100, Top 20, maybe even the Top 10 (although not mine personally). But I truly do not see No. 1 or No. 3. I really can't place my finger on it, and perhaps another viewing on a better-quality tape will help, but it seems to me that The Godfather's hype has gotten to the point where enjoyment of the movie is starting to be flawed because of it. 9.5/10"
4854,False,"Take a gangster film, dip it in sepia tones, wrap it in Nino Rota's elegiac score, add soap and sentiment, and you've got The Godfather, the ""Gone with the Wind"" of gangster films. And like GWTW, The Godfather represents old-style Hollywood film-making at its most popular, but it's no masterpiece, and Goodfellas and The Sopranos make it seem almost antiquated. Coppola's direction attempts to be sweeping, but the script and the characters are shallow and predictable. Scaled to be epic, the film is slow moving and talky with several characters and sequences that feel dispensable. The film doesn't really deepen or build excitement as it progresses, and despite all the talk about family, the members of the Corleone family are essentially stock characters. Pacino, Shire, Cazales, and Caan don't bond as a family, the patriarch is not a commanding or even likable figure who would inspire love or loyalty and Morgana King as mama barely exists. Though it netted an Oscar, Brando's largely immobile performance is gimmicky, and really a supporting role in terms of screen time. The Godfather is the story of Michael Corleone, and the film is owned by a brilliant Al Pacino. In support, Caan, Keaton and Duvall are pretty much one-note. The Godfather is an acknowledged film classic that became a cultural touchstone which inspired imitations and parodies;it was a media event and a box office phenomenon that swept the Oscars and Brando's sending Sasheen Littlefeather to refuse his Oscar only added to it's legend."
4855,False,"After hearing about this legendary film I decided it was about time I watched it....after about an hour I really wished I hadn't wasted the money renting it...after the movie finished I was bored.  The film was nothing like I had expected and I don't know how it possibly made it as big as it has.  It was quite well cast I love Diane Keaton but she's better in Woody Allen's comedy's than in this derivitive movie.  You want a good gangster movie...watch Goodfella's...it actually has a good story, entertaining characters & violence and paints a much more realistic picture of the mob world of the era.  I'm not even going to bother watching parts 2 or 3 of the godfather coz Marlon Brando ain't even in them so their ain't much point! I think I'll go watch Marlon Brando's greatest performance...Guy's N Doll's."
4856,False,"Are you kidding me? This movie is at best a 6 on a good day. The mere fact that this movie continually shows up on AFI's Top Ten list tells me that action and brutality are preferred by Americans over plot and acting. It is a decent film but nothing more. There is no way it is in the same league as ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Casablanca"", or ""Lawrence of Arabia"". It angers me every time this movie gets voted # 2 on some movie list. Al Pacino and Brando are good, but it was not the best work that either of these actors produced. It is an entertaining film like ""Indiana Jones"" and ""National Treasure"" but it is not a classic. It is important to remember that just because a film is popular does not mean that it is a great movie. If you enjoy mob movies this one is probably the best of a bad lot in the modern era, but the older films with Bogart, Cagney, and Robinson put this film to shame. I will be delighted when people one day realize the true worth of this film."
4857,False,"Personally, I found this movie to be quite overrated. Even though it was a good movie, I see very little that makes it great. The movie is long, and often long winded. The only standout that I see is Brando's incredible acting. Mr. Brando and Al Pacino both make this long film bearable."
4858,False,"When I first went on this site, I was so excited what the top movie was I nearly exploded. When I saw that this prestigious position was taken by the Coppola classic, The Godfather, I was like ""Ah, not what I expected, but it seems deserving."" When I actually rented it out in the hope that it would be the best movie ever, I was quite shocked. What I'm trying to say people is DO NOT expect it to be the best movie ever made, because it is far from it. It takes SO MUCH out from the original book that you'll wonder if the book and the movie are written by the same person.That's not to say this movie is bad, but rather it misses out on so much from one of the greatest books I've ever read. Where is the Adventures of Johnny and Nino!? Where is the vaginal surgery?? Why isn't Doctor Jules in this movie?! Why the hell did they make Tessio insignificant? Why didn't they let you know more about Paulie Gatto?? The only reason you'll want to see this is if you are a mob movie fanatic or so you will understand the 2nd movie more (which by the way is in every respect better). It is a good movie, but there are many flaws such as the acting quality, the way that you must practically smash your windows because your turning the volume up so high to understand what they're saying among other things. Good movie, but not #1."
4859,False,"I'm voting and commenting about this film just to bring it down from its pedestal and invite everyone to do the same. I have nothing against Italians, the Mafia or any of the principals, but best film ever? Never. It was an entertaining film, which displayed some rather ridiculous acting, in a gross piece of defamation perpetrated on the Italians. I have nothing again violence and gore... even sex, on screen when appropriate, but this is a ludicrous consensus your readership has reached and it must be corrected."
4860,False,"1.- Pouring alcohol into an injury. 2.- Counting the number of books available in a big library. 3.- Reading all those books. 4.- Watching the Weather Channel for 5 hours. 5.- Looking for a needle in a haystack. 6.- Counting the hays in the haystack. 7.- Sharpening 10,000 pencils in a row. 8.- Seeing a tortoise walk a distance of about let¬¥s say, a million miles.You get the idea, don¬¥t you? This movie was so sloooooooooow, and the story just draaaaaaaaaaaags on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. It was a torture, and at the end, I wondered: WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS MESS OF A MOVIE? It seemed like it was also going to tell us the story of Michael's sons, grandsons, great grandsons,  great great grandsons, and well.... it just seemed endless. ENDLESS. I wondered why IMDb users praise it so much if every single person that I know despises this movie. It's beyond dull. At the end, somehow Michael got rid of ALL of his enemies, in 2 minutes? Just that simple? He should have made that before, and he would have kept me from suffering this dreck. After watching this, I never want to watch one of those called ""classics"" (like Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Schindler¬¥s list, Gone with the Wind, etc.) because it seems to ba a rule that a movie can¬¥t be artistic and entertaining. Few movies combine those things. Those are the true classics. One example? Pulp Fiction. That movie is perfect in every possible way.I'll rate this movie a 3. I don't give it a one just because Marlon Brando was great. By the way, Al Pacino sucked in this movie. He couldn't have been more inexpressive."
4861,False,"Finally took the time to give myself a real treat and watch this film again after about 20 years as I remembered it as a supremely good film. I have watched many movies from all over the world during the years and have developed a keen eye for good film making, so wanted to review one of the ""greats"".After having watched it again, I have no choice but to face the fact that this film is indeed very poor film making and I have to admit that I feel embarrassed that I once actually considered this a good film!The biggest gripe I have with this film is the unbelievably poor and unconvincing acting, devoid of any emotional depth whatsoever. Everybody is sterile and no-one is worth caring even the least bit about.Secondly, almost every opportunity for character dynamics and development is missed. The only character that is developed is Michael Corleone's and even that character is changing from one extreme to the other, in an instant, with no transition whatsoever. The result is characters as mere moronic caricatures to the point of absurdity. A staggering waste of talent.To top it off, the storyline is thin and highly predictable, simply an unforgivable waste of potential.The organized crime genre of films have always fascinated me and continue to do so. With so many truly great films in this genre, don't waste your time on this one. The Godfather is one of the very worst."
4862,False,"There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox"
4863,False,"Well what superlatives can i give a movie that probably has had them all. This film is and will remain a classic in any era. Up step Al Pacino, from virtually nowhere this actor, amongst a frighteningly illustrious cast, absolutely blows them away and gives a performance that has given him legendary status.Everything about this movie, form the acting, to the direction to the sound track is perfect in every sense of the word. Most people that have not seen the movie will probably think of it as a classic gangster movie, but it so much more then that, family, love, romance, revenge all this in one movie is truly remarkable.For me this movie is my all time favourite it gets better every time I watch it and it rightly deserves to be at the top of the all time movies"
4864,False,"This is an excellent movie. It has great actors great scenes and a great storyline. There is only one complaint that I have about it, a lot of the material covered in the book is not in the movie. Without giving away too much of the story there are many ""books""(more like parts to the book) of the Godfather novel, such as the book II( focusing on Johnny Fontaine). Other than the exclusion of some parts that aren't focus on the main characters this is an extremely close adaptation of the novel( word for word in many sense epically near the begging of the movie). Al Pachino is at the top in this movie and steals the show, Brando is great also and Robert Duvol as Tom Hagen was wonderful.This is one of the best movies ever made."
4865,False,"The movie has it all, and everything is handled to perfection.The plot is so intriguing, one never gets bored.The performances are top notch, especially Marlon Brando(the MOST CHARISMATIC PERFORMANCE OF ALL TIME), Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan.HIGHLY recommended for anyone who has missed the best movie ever made."
4866,False,"I picked this movie up at my local video store this past weekend, as I planned a ""movie night"" for myself.  Quickly into the movie, I found out why many consider this film as the best of all time.  Every performance was gripping, every scene, every character.  Even the time frame (late 1940s) was perfect.  After the movie's final scene, I wanted to rush back to the video store and rent Parts 2 and 3.  Truly a GREAT piece of cinema!"
4867,False,"Contains no spoiler..!!.Firstly i must say what mind blowing performance by Al Pacino and Marlon Brando.Even after 40 years this movie doesn't get old .Based on novel by Mario Puzo's,Francis has done beautiful job portraying greatest mob drama of all time. Francis ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' is regarded as greatest movie of all time.And when i saw it i understood why.Everything has been meticulously put together to create an entertaining.captivating. and phenomenal masterpiece!!!!.JUST BUY THE MOVIE AND WATCH IT ...!!!"
4868,False,"The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,brilliant,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece that combines terrific direction,amazing performances from an outstanding cast,a wonderful script and a powerful score. All of those elements make The Godfather a flawless film that is cinema and Francis Ford Coppola at their best.Based on Mario Puzo's novel and set in New York City in the 1940s and 50s,The Godfather tells the story of Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando),a Don and Mob Boss who is the head of The Corleone Family but is aging. But when Vito becomes a victim of Mob warfare,his youngest son Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)steps in to take over the family as the new don and to protect his Father and family at all costs.What else can be said about The Godfather that hasn't been said before? It's an absolute masterpiece of cinema that is an instant classic from the moment you first watch it. There are plenty of iconic and memorable characters,lines and moments throughout the film that have become apart of our pop culture that when you the name The Godfather everyone knows what the film is even if people haven't seen it. The Godfather is a very revolutionary film especially with the Gangster/Mob genre because before The Godfather Gangster and Mob films used to be defined by the great Warner Bros Gangster Crime Dramas that starred movie icons James Cagney,Edward G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart but The Godfather reinvented the Gangster/Mob genre and has a style that has been imitated but not duplicated. Where would Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics Goodfellas and Casino or the classic TV series The Sopranos be without The Godfather? The Godfather is a big,epic film that gives viewers a larger than life depiction of a organized Crime family showing the danger,tragedy and sadness that goes on in the violent world that the Corleone's have to deal with throughout the film. Some have said that The Godfather and it's sequels romanticizes the Gangster and Mafia lifestyle and made the mafia world bright and while that may or may not be true,The Godfather is still surrounded with darkness showing the horrifying and deadly consequences of being in the Gangster world where no one is safe. The film is an epic in the truest sense of the world with the length being 175 minutes(2 hrs and 55 minutes)and with The Godfather being an epic there is multiple characters and story lines but director Francis Coppola keeps the film interesting and keeps you glued to the screen with many powerful,intense scenes that punch the viewer in the gut. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is amazing and flawless with many scenes and dialog that is riveting and powerful and none of the dialog and scenes feel forced or fake but feel natural and believable. The screenplay while taking out some of the subplots of the book stays true to Mario Puzo's book with dialog that comes directly from the book. The Godfather's script is movie screen writing at it's very best The Godfather gave birth to two of the greatest and most iconic characters in movie history in Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone. When we see Vito in the first we are easily captivated by him and how he is because despite being a don and major crime figure he can be friendly and helpful with his family and friends earning tons of respect. Vito is also smart and has a moral code when it comes with his family while at the same time using violence against his enemies when needed. With Michael we see how different he becomes throughout the film because at first he wants nothing to do with the family business but when his Father and family are in danger in Michael's mind he has no choice but to run the family but in his own way. Where as Vito is a friendly and helpful don,Michael is cold and vicious but with these two characters there is many levels of depth that make them classic characters you will never forget. Violence plays a big part in The Godfather and the violence in this film shocking with scenes that are brutal and harsh but are true to the universe that The Godfather takes place in. The ending of The Godfather is easily one of the best endings in movie history and greatly sets up the events in Part II. A terrific ending.The cast is flawless. Marlon Brando is excellent,iconic and at his very best in his Oscar winning role as Vito Corleone,with Brando being charismatic,powerful and sympathetic in the role. Masterful performance from Brando. Al Pacino is brilliant as Michael Corleone,with Pacino being intense,cool and captivating in the role and having great scenes with Brando. James Caan is amazing and fiery as Santino 'Sonny' Corleone,Michael's short tempered older brother. Roberl DuVall is terrific as Tom Hagan,the Corleone's adopted family member and lawyer. Diane Keaton is great as Kay Adams,Michael's girlfriend. Richard Castellano(Clemenza)and Abe Vigoda(Tessio)do wonderful jobs as Vito's Caporegimes. John Gazale(Fredo Corleone),Talia Shire(Connie Corleone),Al Lettieri(Sollozzo),Sterling Hayden(Capt. McCluskey),John Marley(Jack Woltz),Richard Conte(Don Barzini),Alex Rocco(Moe Greeneand Gianni Russo(Carlo)give riveting performances as well.The direction by Francis Coppola is brilliant and stylish,with Coppola always moving the camera and using great lighting and a visual look to the movie that makes The Godfather what it is. Masterful direction,Coppola.The score by Nino Rota is amazing,beautiful,haunting and iconic matching the movie and every scene perfectly. Terrific score Rota.In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,Gangster Films,Mob Movies,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see The Godfather,an excellent and unforgettable masterpiece that you will watch again,again and again and is film making at it's best. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
4869,False,"The first words in Francis Coppola's organized crime saga (""I believe in America"") are spoken by a wronged father seeking justice from Mafia Don Vito Corleone, and with an immigrant's passion invoke the spirit of his adapted homeland. It's an ironic gesture in a film which embraces the American Dream with a vengeance, beginning with a joyful celebration of marriage, ending with a solemn Catholic Church baptism, and continuing in between with murder after bloody murder: for vengeance; for punishment; or (with a severed horse head under the bed sheets) simply for leverage. The film gained notoriety for such epic displays of gangland violence, but its real power lies in nuance: a shading of phrase; a deceptive fall of lamplight; the sound of footsteps on a hospital stairway. Credit goes to co-writers Coppola and Mario Puzo for the leisurely paced but tightly plotted screenplay, by itself a remarkable study in contrasts, showing the thin line dividing patriotism and graft; honor and brutality; family affections and ritual violence. Seeing Part One independent from its companion/sequel is like reading only the middle chapters of a long and complex historical novel, rich in detail and drama, about an immigrant family coping with changing times in the New World. The result is one of the few truly effective adaptations of a popular novel, and together with Part Two perhaps the last word in gangster film dramas."
4870,False,"""The Godfather"" is a movie that tops many list as the greatest movie ever made. It also tops some list concerning the greatest and most memorable movie lines and the movie it's characters and performances from its actors have also received lots of acclaim throughout the years. And yes, the movie is truly deserving all of the praise that is receiving from everywhere and everyone.Even though in my opinion part II is an even better movie, this is still the movie that began it all. Without this movie there of course would had never been a second one and this movie beautifully laid down the foundations for the even greater masterpiece that part II was, even though it's missing the presence of the great Marlon Brando in it.The movie is a greatly epic one, not in the least due to it's amazing running time of 175 minutes. But despite it's very long running time it really is not a movie that ever bores, even not at moments when not a lot is happening in the story. There always is something great or intriguing happening.But the movie is also really epic in many more different ways. It's like an operatic drama about a large Italian mafia family, located in New York. The movie features really a lot of characters in it and therefore also some different plot lines and dramatic developments but the movie does an amazing job with its story and the diversity of it. It binds it all beautifully together and even though the movie does take some big leaps in time and gets located at different locations throughout the world, throughout the entire movie, the movie always keeps flowing very well with a real steady pace.The family and basically all of the character have to go through some great ordeals. This means that characters keep developing throughout the entire, which is most notable with the Al Pacino character. His character goes through a great transformation, from being a polite, quite and perhaps also soft guy, to a tough and commanding crime boss, who doesn't back off for violence or any killings.In its essence it's a movie about tight bond of a family and what it means to stay loyal and stick together through tough times. Even though you know that all of these people are big criminals and even killers, the movie at all times keeps giving them a very human face by showing what makes them tick and it also isn't afraid to show the character emotions.It's of course also thanks to the many great characters of the movie that the characters develop so well and work out on basically every level. It features a still quite young Al Pacino in his break through role and the already more experienced and better known actors James Caan and James Caan, among many others, in important supporting roles. But it is of course Marlon Brando who gives the movie its most body. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters of all time and it was also basically this movie that made him immortal as an actor. The movie only won 3 Oscars but it's no big surprise that one of those 3 went to Brando, who himself of course refused to accept it and instead let faked Indian Sacheen Littlefeather pick it up, as a sign of protest against the treatment of native Americans. The other two Oscar's that the movie won were for best motion picture and best writing.It deserved to win way more of course and the movie was also nominated for 7 more (not counting in the withdrawn nomination for best music). But one of the Oscar's the movie really deserved to win was for a category it wasn't even nominated in. I was surprised how great the cinematography of the movie was and it truly deserves some more credit. The movie often picks some long shots, in which it isn't always showing a lot. The movie often chooses to show a minimum of things and only chooses to show what the characters also see, so we get more close to the characters and their feelings and thoughts. Truly some effective cinematography throughout, though Francis Ford Coppola directing also needs to take lots of credit for that.Simply THE crime epic of the 20th century.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
4871,False,"The Godfather Trilogy was projected on one single day at the Paris cinematheque: 9 hours of film and 9 hours of pure delight!I was motivated to see this trilogy in particular because it's one of my first heart-struck in movies! I should thank my father for this, because as kids, we watched what he watched and it formatted me for ever: the music, the pride and honor of the family, their confidence find a resonance in me, even though their heart are deeply corrupted by evil and they pay the price by the death of all dear ones! What's the point of getting rich and powerful if it to live alone ? You can read my review of the ""The Last Don"" for an in-depth analysis because the thematic background is the same¬ÖBrando is wonderful as an old Don and he looks like my late grandfather. As we haven't time to spend time together, I am sure I take Vito as an idealized root! What caught my eyes in this first movie was that: - the story takes place just after WWII (and not in 60 or 70) - it's Christmas time just as the projection - the dementia greed of Vito who wants a son to be President! - Their way of getting at the top: when they are denied help, they kill & when they are asked for help, they exchange it for a favor! It's far from streets tugs who ransom people!So, as it is maybe the best movie ever made, you should see it and it's an offer you can't refuse!"
4872,False,"The Puzo novel is brought to the screen in the definitive tale of the Mafia. A towering achievement for Coppola, who was only 32 when this film was released. Brando is ideally cast in the title role, but his is basically a supporting role. This is the story of Michael, and Pacino is excellent in conveying the transformation of the character from a geeky soldier to a tough mob boss. Caan, Duvall, and Castellano head the terrific supporting cast. Despite the nearly three-hour running time, it does not drag for a minute. The cinematography perfectly evokes the period. Rota's score is one of the most memorable in film history."
4873,False,"The Godfather (1972, Dir. Francis Ford Coppola) Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is the head of an organised dynasty, who has an expanded family, which he loves truly. But when Don Vito is shot and ends up in hospital, control of the family business is given to his son, Michael (Pacino), who must go into hiding for the protection of himself and his father.Cinematic classic which can't go wrong. Marlon Brando has been perfectly cast in the role which gains every emotion from him. Along with Pacino and the rest of the supporting cast, the Godfather keeps you hooked in for the entire length of its running time.He came all the way from California. I told you he'd come! - Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando)"
4874,False,"I am not saying anything new when I say that this is the best movie in the history of cinema (at least for most of the people). ""The godfather"" is a major film with a great plot, great performances and it is entertaining since its first moment until the last second. Most of us who have watched it know at least almost of memory some little phrase told by any of its characters.I am not a big fan of Marlon Brando (even thought I found him extraordinary in ""A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)"") but I recognize that he made the role of ""vito corleone"" one of the 5 most important characters in the history of cinema, nobody could have made this character better than him. Al Pacino became famous thanks to his performance as Michael Corleone in this film, where we can see his transformation from a nice guy to a cold mafia boss.I have watched this film like 10 times and each new time I watch it I like it more.The best movie ever"
4875,False,"I have not watched this film since the 70's. But my 18 year old son kept on pestering me to watch it with him because it was the IMDb No1. The IMDb rating is our guide for watching any film and that infuriates my wife ""Why can't you two just enjoy a film without checking if it's good or not on that website you go on?"" I put off watching it with him for ages because it's about 3 hours long and I'm prone to falling asleep. But I watched the Godfather again tonight with my wife and son. We were silent from start to finish with the power and emotion of this film. I just love the way this the film portrays the mafia as an ordinary family that we begin to like. They have staunch religious beliefs in attending weddings, baptisms and funerals plus morals like we won't do narcotics. Yet they can murder somebody and it's just ""business"". The Godfather has no car chase, no gory violence and no idol threats like ""I'm going to blow you away motherf*cker"" It just makes you an offer that you can't refuse."
4876,False,"Don Vito Corleone is the mightiest Mafia boss of New York. He has contacts to the most esteemed politicians and achieves everything he gets into his head. This changes when a drug dealer asks him to join the drug traffic. Vito declines this offer, because he (ironically) considers this ""line of business"" to be a crime. Thereon the drug dealers' men assault Vito and he nearly loses his life. His sons Sonny and Michael thereupon start a campaign of vengeance against the drug dealer and the other dons of New York.With high expectations I began to watch the film, due to the fact that it is the highest rated movie of the IMDb and regarded as one of the best films all-time.In the first half hour there are comparatively few spectacular events, but ""The Godfather"" manages it to tie the viewer, conveying the atmosphere very well. So the movie never becomes boring. The interaction of the Mafiosi, their language and methods are amazingly enthralling. Also the setting (amongst others the film takes place in Sicily) and the film music are outstanding.The main characters are presented very well: The mighty Godfather, who has moralities and takes care of his family despite his racketeering, and on the other hand the ""good boy"" of the family, who is impelled to dirty his hands and become an unscrupulous, ice cold gangster by the assault on his father.Francis Ford Coppola's film becomes a true masterpiece by the performance of the two leading actors, Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) and Al Pacino (Michael Corleone). Their facial expressions and gestures are just unparalleled and don't lay you to rest.The film won prizes in series (Oscars, Golden Globes) ¬ñ that's absolutely merited: Everyone should watch this film at least one time; it is a very prestigious film, above all amongst men it is popular, and it has a very high cultic-factor."
4877,False,"My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation. All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an ""offer he can't refuse"", or ""Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes"" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.In fact it's all beautifully played."
4878,False,"Even quite tense at times - that restaurant scene had my heart pounding, as did the hospital scene. But it is overhyped. Okay, scene composition and direction are top notch, yadda yadda, acting is phenomenal, but you can't watch it without thinking ""everyone says this is the greatest film of all time"". Well maybe it is for some, but the film suffers from high expectations as a consequence. Not that you, gentle reader, are interested, but I didn't rate it as highly as Apocalypse Now, Seven Samurai or even Star Wars, but it deserves a respectable 8/10 and if you haven't seen it, its worth 3 hours of your time.Just don't believe the hype."
4879,False,"This film is long and dull. As a result of the first it is dull for very long periods, which is why this film warrants no more than a miserly 1/10. The acting is competent but no more and I must confess I lost my focus towards the end due to the quite shocking lack of entertainment that can be attributed to a poor script, lacklustre direction and a plot which leaves a lot to be desired. People say Godfather is rare in that its sequel improves upon it, but that isn't hard. Al Pacino gained a big reputation from this one and I am left bemused as to why, and this unfortunate idea has meant Pacino, a mediocre actor at best has been able to infiltrate our cinema screens on far too many occasions with a distinct lack of passion or charisma in any role he displays."
4880,False,"After watching a lot of the movies on the IMDb top 250 list, I have to somewhat agree with where the movie is placed. I watched the #2 movie, Shawshank Redemption, at least five times and it was just awesome. Finally, I got The Godfather and expected a lot from it, seeing that it would have to be better than Shawshank Redemption. However, I could barely sit through half of The Godfather. Absolutely NOTHING happens. Yeah, so some guy gets shot. Then some people get angry. Wow.Anyway, I would have to grudgingly say that the acting is pretty good, but good acting doesn't make a movie worth seeing. As an old movie, I guess that the overall quality can't be too great. But, even with all that aside, this movie still lacks a good plot, and, maybe even more importantly, emotion. The Shawshank Redemption really made me sympathize with the characters, while this movie just made me go to sleep more quickly (it was that boring).I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
4881,False,"Quite possibly the MOST over rated film in history. Never has there been so much made of so little. It is an OK movie if you like discriminate killing and foul language and the glorification of ""gang"" lifestyle. This movie hardly belongs in the top 50 let alone be in the #1 spot. Do you know what the saddest part of this movie is? That it was remade two more times with the Godfather III being quite possible the worst remake EVER. I'm not saying you won't like the movie. It is entertaining at times and certainly some very good lines have come from the movie. I just can't stand when movies can't stand up to their own hype."
4882,False,"No.1 Movie of all time? I think that's what ruined it for me, I sat down expecting to watch the most spectacular cinematic experience of my life - but instead I ended up sitting rather bored for the good part of 3hours. Everything about it just lacked in moving me, the vengeance was untouched, parts of the story seemed to obvious and other parts just left untouched. Thoroughly this was the most disappointing film I've ever seen, not the worst, just the most disappointing. I'm not trying to change anyone's thoughts on the film or make out the film is bad - just in case anyone gets the impression. Thanks"
4883,False,"The Godfather in one word...Perfect. This film has some of the best scenes I've seen all my life. The script is superb and the director is one of the best in the business. The actors were great and all played a vital role in this masterpiece. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino have possibly given their best performances in this film than any other they have starred in. Some people might not like this film because it's too long but I think that's sad. People like them should absolutely give this film a chance and if they still don't like it then there is something completely wrong with their taste in movies. Overall, The Godfather is an outstanding achievement of Hollywood cinema and it delivers on ALL accounts. There is nothing bad I have to say about this film. It is literally perfect.I give The Godfather a perfect: 5/5 or 10/10"
4884,False,"So, the best movie ever? No. Not in my opinion, but I can see where the sayers get it. the Godfather was rather ground breaking film for it's time, a rather bold film, but still it's not the cinematic masterpiece everyone keeps raving about.Coppolas best film is ""Apocalypse, Now"". That is something that is extremely hard to top. When you compare the two the style of directing is so different, that they almost look like they were shot by two different directors.Godfather's biggest issue is poorly made editing, unnecessarily lengthened out scenes and totally unnecessary scenes, but then again what can you expect of a film, which was something, or so I've heard, that even the director was frustrated about. Some scenes just linger on the screen, without any evidence, that the director really knew what he wanted, and, in the end, the producers decided to amp it all in the film just because the material was there.The best thing about the film is acting. There's no way denying that. This is the film, which shows why people think Marlon Brando is one of the greatest actors of the history. This is the film that showed us the genius of Al Pacino.It's been some time since I've seen part 2, but I remember liking it better, I've always thought it was a vast improvement from the first one."
4885,False,"I saw this for the first time as a teenager and was pretty bored.  At the same time I was seeing things like ""Scarecrow"" and ""Deliverance"" so its not like I was just interested in seeing juvenile nonsense. 
I've seen it again recently, twice.  I admire the movie, I like it, it holds my interest, I think its very good.  But I fail to understand why the imdb trolls think its the greatest thing since the invention of the lightbulb. For that reason I've rated it lower than I normally would cause you've all gone overboard in your admiration.  Pacino not winning an Oscar is a huge injustice.  He makes the entire movie worthwhile and doesn't even have to talk.  James Caan is miscast.  Brando is terrific but if he didn't win, I don't think the earth would have ceased existing.  Its Pacino's movie, through and through, and someone must have agreed w/me on that, since the second one is his, too."
4886,False,"The movie was based on a very bad book with a horrible language and style. It's no secret that the movie is better than the book, but it doesn't make it good.The story that turns violent ruthless criminals into men of honor and the horrible world of crime into something beautiful and almost royal.It's unnecessarily violent and why did Brando put paper towel in his mouth? I mean I like him as an actor, but this character is absolutely ridiculous.I don't understand how anyone could give an Oscar for that film! It's just stupid!"
4887,False,"'The Godfather' is one of the most well-known films of all time, and its popularity has made it a legend. It is the ultimate Mafia film. The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse's severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It's one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I've seen much better films that 'The Godfather', and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film. Good, and it probably could not have any better, but it just failed to really inspire me as a film."
4888,False,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs The epic tale of Don Vito (Marlon Brando) head and patriarch of the Corleone crime family.When a rival family tries to muscle in on their patch,they offer the usual resistance.But when the Don is brutally gunned down in the street,a vicious attempt on his life,it falls to his sons,Michael (Al Pacino),the youngest,a Vietnam vet just returned home from active service,Fredo (John Cazele) the more reserved,prone-to-mistakes brother and Scillio (James Caan) his hot-headed,violent son,to settle the score both amicably and with mettle.It's funny that just six days ago I was reviewing a film that ranked #18 on the bottom 100 list and yet today I'm reviewing a film that ranks right up at #1 on the top 250.Yet,indeed,this is truly an epic film that everyone who would like to call themselves a film connoisseur owes it to themselves to see.Brando sadly passed away last year.If not for his extroverted private life,he will undoubtedly be best remembered for his leading role here,despite the staggeringly short amount of screen-time he actually occupies.Pacino too really launched his career here,and it's amazing to look back and see how young and fresh-faced he looked.In supporting roles,the film also undoubtedly helped make big names out of Caan and Robert Duvall as the family lawyer.Even the director,Francis Ford Coppola,probably never made anything that matched this (especially if you consider the chunks of cr*p he was shooting out later in his career.) What I found most notable about the film is actually the sweeping,powerful score that plays over all the scenes with a majesty that is truly compelling and will stick in your mind for a while after you've seen it.But more than that,it is a film that is truly rich and flowing with texture and depth,that manages to flow with the vitality of the characters.I have a short attention span,like a lot of people of the MTV generation,so it's a film you might find hard to settle down and watch without fidgeting around a lot.But anyone who sees it would be unable to deny that it is,well,really what film-making is all about,truly masterful,fulfilled,dynamic stuff that puts a lot of the rubbish that gets spewed out today to shame.*****"
4889,False,"I thought the book was overdone and corny when I read it in 71; and I thought the movie was overacted and bordered on fantasy when I saw it in 72.Having spent 22 years in a major city's police department, I had occasion to deal with these mob types now and again. They are nothing like those portrayed in the film. They are hollow shells of men who somehow know their bravado is a sham.There are some good action scenes in the picture, but I find the constant atmosphere of universal admiration of thuggery to be aimed at the juvenile patron."
4890,False,"The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola's epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn't make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original ""Movie Brats"" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" I love this film to death! Marlon Brando's performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando's the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!! The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to a resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. (Paramount Pictures) The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945-55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.Definitely one of the best crime gangster movie of all time. The movie that changed the history forever! Francis Ford Coppola's direction was superb and fantastic, not even that he shot with camera scenes that is impossible to lost. The film has character development, a terrific cast and awesome epic scenes that I love. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone did a wonderful fantastic job as Michael's Sister and Vito's daughter. Gosh this movie is awesome and fantastic! I love it to death!!!!!10/10 Grade: Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Paramount Pictures Starring: Marlon Brando,Al Pacino,James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall,Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte,Diane Keaton Director: Francis Ford Coppola Producer: Albert S.

4891,False,"Greetings from Lithuania.To call ""The Godfather"" a masterpiece or a classic would be underestimating. This is simply put, one of the very best (if not the best) motion pictures ever created. I saw this movie 3 or 4 times, and i never get tired of it. After some time passes, you kinda feel a need to revisit it again.There isn't anything new that i could say about this picture that wasn't said before countless times. Everything works here on such level, that it creates this rich, deep and unforgettable world. From whole trilogy, Part 1 is my favorite by a mile. 2nd and 3rd movies are great in their own terms, but first one is another level.Acting, directing, writing, music (the music!), set design - it's a thing of beauty and admiration to a movie crafting art.Overall, because you have probably already have seen this masterpiece, I can only recommend it to not forget it for a long time and revisit it once in a while. It contains everything that an educated cinema-goer can wish. The unforgettable and one of the kind motion picture, which probably like a great wine just keeps getting better with years."
4892,False,"'The Godfather', the first part in Francis Ford Coppola's classic crime trilogy, is an almost perfect movie, with every aspect of it working to its advantage. Before this film, Coppola wasn't known much for his directorial skills. But the mastery of art he showed with this masterpiece amazed everyone.From Marlon Brando's stunning makeover to the incredible acting of almost every member of the cast, Gordon Willis' spectacular cinematography, tight editing, the remarkable background score (Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola), and almost everything else in the movie is quite flawless. No matter how many times you watch it, from the opening scene with Don Vito being asked for a favour at his daughter's wedding, to the final scene with door closing on Don Michael, the new ruthless boss of the Mafia family, the movie's three-hour long runtime captivates you till the very end. It's unlike most other crime movies with too many plot twists, action sequences, etc. The film is quite character-driven. It mainly shows the transformation of the character Michael Corleone, the war hero returning home during his sister Connie's wedding. Michael was the innocent and reluctant one in the family, who always stayed away from the family business. After certain events, he is compelled to take over the business, and it's sad and intriguing at the same time to see this character slowly evolve into something completely different from what Vito, Michael or any of us had expected. Ultimately, it's a movie all about family.Marlon Brando was not even 50 when he gives his Oscar-winning incredible performance as the head of the Corleone family. Al Pacino, who plays the central character, gets his career launched with this movie, and shows what he's capable of. Other supporting actors like James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Richard S. Castellano, etc. - all of them give brilliant performances.There are so many scenes and dialogues in the movie which are more than memorable: the opening favour scene, the horse head on the studio head's bed, the sequences together showing the planned downfall of the family (including shooting of Don Vito), and especially, the craftily directed baptism scene, during which the family executes a few things to finally rise up.Nothing can be pinpointed in this movie to be called as flawed; it's an exceptional crime drama. It's an astute adaptation, and the movie stands on its own. But if it had a little more heart, I could have called it a flawless and perfect masterpiece."
4893,False,"Gangster movies aren't really my thing, despite the often technical brilliance behind them. I watched ""Goodfellas"" and admired it but I didn't love it like other people I know do. Which is why it took me some time to get around to watching what many IMDb users consider the second best movie of all time. Personally, I wouldn't go that far but this remains an iconic movie both in terms of subject, film-making and legacy. Few movies ever achieve the same levels of influence and adoration as this movie and while I respect it enormously, I'm struggling to love it with as much enthusiasm but frankly, that's a matter of personal taste.""The Godfather"", based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, opens with a big wedding scene in New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the family, granting his friends special favours in return for their loyalty and respect. But after an attempt on his life, Vito's eldest son Sonny (James Caan) begins to run things his way while young Michael (Al Pacino) struggles to separate his desire to remain outside his father's shadowy world and the promise of a normal life with his beloved Kay (Diane Keaton). But as things come to a violent head, Michael's loyalty to Kay is tested and he soon finds himself becoming the very thing he hoped to avoid.You don't need me to tell you how brilliantly made ""The Godfather"" is but for a newbie like me, it's a stunning film to watch. Each frame has a level of care and attention that you rarely see imbued in movies today and the extensive running time gives the film the luxury to take its time to tell the tale of a fading crime boss and his son's descent into the business. ""The Godfather"" occupies a unique world on many levels - the film never mentions the word 'mafia' although that is plainly what it is showing and with horrible authenticity as well. But there remains honour among these various criminals and by the end, Vito has gone from being a ruthless crime boss to a loving family man who'd do anything for his children and grandchildren. Performances are also faultless across the board - Brando is unforgettable as Vito but for me, Pacino delivers a masterpiece of acting. The pain and anger as he begins to embrace his father's lifestyle is etched clearly on his face and you never doubt him for an instant. He also looks really young in this (which, of course, he was) to the point of almost becoming a distraction - a bit like Robert Duvall with a full head of hair. But Coppola's direction is every bit as good - take the moment at his son's baptism with Michael renouncing Satan, knowing full well that his enemies were being gunned down elsewhere at that very moment or the assassination attempt on Vito's life, again a wonderful moment of cinema.Even the soundtrack, fuelled by mournful trumpets that emphasise the tragedy on screen, is perfect for ""The Godfather"" and there is no doubt that this is one of the best and most imitated movies of all time. So why don't I love it? Minor quibbles really - I struggled to remember who characters were, which side they were on and why they were killing other people. I also felt that the running time was slightly excessive but I can forgive Coppola for that. I doubt that I will wait as long to watch the other two films (which are ready and waiting on my Sky+ box) but for all the wonderful work in front and behind the camera, I just wish that it appealed to me more than it does. Put it down to personal tastes but if you're looking for a gangster flick then this should always be your first point of call. Ground-breaking, trend-setting movie making at its finest."
4894,False,"This movie was everything a good movie should be. I got The Godfather box set last Christmas (I had already watched the series about 20 times by then) and I watched it honestly about 3 weeks straight after getting it. This movie however is hands-down my favorite of the series. The story was amazing, and sure made Mafia life look like paradise. I loved the characters, all of them, even the antagonists were unforgettable. Everything looked authentic 1940's style, there weren't any slip-ups as far as I can tell. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale all make a very authentic looking, and truly remarkable family. I was a huge Godfather encyclopedia for a while, I knew 95% of the characters and everything, and its easy to see why, this is a very memorable movie in every aspect. I loved this film at first sight. I read some of the ""Hated it"" comments, and they all say its boring or something. Those people need to grow up, if you want an action movie watch Die Hard or something, this movie is a classic and if those people lack the taste for good movies to watch it they need to take their hate of it elsewhere. This is a perfect movie and deserves a 10/10. Watch this if you want a truly unforgettable experience."
4895,False,"While I certainly wouldn't call this THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE, this movie sure has a lot going for it, starting with the cast. I of course like Brando and Pacino going at it, but my personal faves are James Caan and of course my main man Robert Duvall. All of them give dynamite performances here, forever raising the bar to new actors everywhere. Even though the movie is 3 hours, it hardly ever drags, Coppola has a tight rein on the story (or maybe it's the producers doing that?) and it makes for a highly charged, highly entertaining classic of the first order. Funny as It seems, I only got around to finally watching this movie last year. Although I'm not exactly doing facepalms over the fact I've waited this long to see it, this movie will never grow old with me,"
4896,False,"The story is disjointed, the acting is terrible (especially Corleone who sounds like he's got a stick up his ass), the film is too long, the wedding scene is almost perpetual, which makes me ask, how did this get a 9.2? I'm shocked to be honest, what an awful, awful movie this is and I don't say that a lot about movies since I tend to appreciate what they are and what they are trying to convey, but this? This is an embarrassment and has to go down as the most overrated movie of all time in my book. There's no good acting performances in the movie, no memorable lines, no excitement, nothing. I'm genuinely disgusted that this movie has such high accolades because to me, it's crap. Absolute crap.Brando's portrayal of Corleone has got to go down as one of the worst acting performances I've ever seen as well. The accent he uses is difficult to understand, the scene where he's shot in that assassination attempt is laughable as he over dramatizes the whole thing and his general acting performance and portrayal of Corleone, who is supposed to be a feared crime lord, is contrived and doesn't look believable. I'm honestly shocked that someone who is rated as one of the best actors who ever lived can perform this badly. This is the first film I've seen Brando in so I think it's unfair to judge his ability as an actor based on this poor performance, but my expectations will definitely be lowered when I watch another movie and see him as part of the cast."
4897,False,"I'm glad there are a few voices of dissent within all of the gushinghype listed here.  Do the fans of this movie rate ""Citizen Kane"" asthe 2nd best film of all time?  Then maybe listen to the Beatles andElvis Presley  as the greatest music of all time?   Is America undersome kind of cultural mass-hypnosis?  Grossly overrated on all counts."
4898,False,"I watched the DVD recently because everyone seems to be hyped about this 'greatest movie on earth'!! Well, I wouldn't waste your valuable time any further writing a lot here after wasting my good 3 hours watching so called God Father. I nearly died of boredom. Simply, this is one of the most boring, longest movies I have ever watched. And it is horrible! Is it a great story? No. Is it a great movie? NOT AT ALL!! It is just a welded work of so many boring, long celluloid pieces together. There is no stature, depth, matter or even an exciting plot. After all, Brando is a good actor but not that great in this one for sure. And I am still at a loss to understand why people give this rut 9.2!! It would of course be totally right just without the 9!"
4899,False,"forced to sit through this —àit so many times by idiots extolling its virtues. i wish it was never made. I'm sick of mafia films and this dross started it all, moody, violent, miserable, and as intelligent as football and drinking. too many idiots today actually believe they are mafia because they sell some pot, or bought a dog that they beat until it turned nasty. grow up and bin this film. wooden acting throughout this title has set the bar for gangster films, and of course gangsters are not known for flair or intelligence when a beating or a bullet appears to cure all ills. the film is not a pleasure to watch, nor could i be less interested in the story of this mediocre family squabble. OK so this is my least favourite genre but it set that level. i urge anyone who hates this film to review it here and bring it down in the rankings to a reasonable 1-3 because the 10/10 that thousands of morons gave this is unreal."
4900,False,"I honestly don't know what to say ... This has got to be the worst movie i've ever had the misfortune to watch and yet it's getting such good reviews. Why anyone would give it a rating above 5 is a mystery to me. Is almost everyone on IMDb just wannabe critics or is there actually something that i just missed while watching this? I found it a challenge just to get through the movie never mind enjoy it! My advice to anyone thinking of watching this - don't, it will only disappoint you. There is no real plot or storyline and the movie is very disengaging. Characters and events are boring to follow and personally I feel that there are plenty more movies more deserving of the credit this movie is given."
4901,False,"Sorry, but i can't believe that this is the most popular film, it dragged on for so long i didn't even see the ending. Don't get me wrong, i love gangster films but this was so unengaging and that by the time Al Pacino shot the 'Bad' copper i had to turn off.The storyline just seemed to be so pointless that i didn't care about whatever happened to the characters. How stupid is putting the horses head in the moviemaker's bed, he knew they were dodgey gangsters so why did change his mind?I can't think of any reasons why this was a good film, if you do then you better tell me!!"
4902,False,"The Godfather is crap...it's a long movie about nothing. I would rather die than watch that crap again...notice crap is written more than a few times? That's because, this is what this movie is...CRAP! The acting is bad, the sets are bad. Overall this is junk. How in the world it's number one on the top 250 is beyond me. You people must have nothing better to do than to watch a movie where people get killed off because they opened their mouths or voiced their thoughts. I can watch that on the news. I hate this movie so much that my roommates are watching it right now, and I have my CD player on as loud as it will go, because I hate this movie! So in closing...The Godfather, all of them, are crap!"
4903,False,"Long and boring and not worth writing two sentences. But since I have to, long and boring and not worth writing two sentences, long and boring and not worth writing two sentences, long and boring and not worth writing two sentences, I think you get my point!"
4904,False,"Don Vito Corleone: ""You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me?"". The godfather to me is a bloody brilliant masterpiece of a film and people may say it is not they cup of tea and am okay with that but this movie changed the way that I thought of movies, the story is about a man called Don Vito Corleone who has this big family and big friends and all in the middle of all of that the family and friends don't know that he works with the gangsters, The acting is out of this world and the music is so chilling and moving with a gangster feel mixed with it, R.I.P. Marlon Brando you beautiful man your brilliant actor bring us a strong Character in the movie that you deserved more then one Oscar and this movie deserved more then 3 Oscars it deserved 10 Oscars that's how good to movie is."
4905,False,"I was present when the filming of the Horse's head scene was done. I was a Police Officer in 1970 for the Nassau County Police Department, New York. I believe in the mid part of 1971, I was assigned, along with about 10 other officers and a Sergeant, to be at the Guggenheim Estate, Sands Point, Nassau County, NY. This estate was County property. The filming of the Horse's head scene and the dining room scene where Robert Duvall requests John Marley to give a film/singing role to one of the Don's relatives. Marley declines Duvall as you see a horse prancing in the meadow outside. Duvall says he will tell the Don in NY. Marley shrugs off Duvall. I was within 50' of both scenes. Coppola actually used real heads of horses ( they were shipped in ice in huge crates, they mixed a blood concoction). Coppola actually was very picky about the head he wanted to use. When Marley opens the sheet and discovers the head, it looks like sunrise. It was actually raining outside, and yellow cellophane was put on the windows. With the proper lighting, it looks like the sun was coming up, yet it was raining outside. The scene of the horse prancing outside was done at another location. The Guggenheim family were very rich and had art collections, etc throughout the mansion. The police were there to safeguard any of these collections. My girlfriend (now wife of over 41 years) was away at college. Banks of phones were set up. I was on the phone talking for a long time each of the three or four days assigned there. I was young and did not realize the assignment that I was on would be so important in the movie world. There were plenty of staff, extras, etc there. We were there for over 10/12 hours per day. Meals were catered. I also was assigned on traffic sometime later near the toll booth scene, filmed out on the old Mitchel Field Air Base. If you look close, at the toll booth, yellow parking lines are on the ground. Lindbergh, a friend of Guggenheim, flew from nearby Roosevelt Field. Somewhere in my attic, is my police memo book with exact dates when assigned as a ""rookie"" to the making of ""The Godfather"". Well, I guess I said enough, contact me if you need any more information. BTW, I retired in 2003, 33 year career. I became a supervisor in 1987 and was assigned to several movie filming on the ""Gold Coast"" of Long Island. One was the new version of ""Sabrina"", starring Harrison Ford....PS I never saw Marlon Brando, I think other scenes were done in Staten Island, part of NYC....thanks..."
4906,False,"The mafia was always seen as evil, secretive and not interesting enough to be a story. Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia. But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo's best-seller to the big screen. He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film: acting and writing.The screenplay by Coppola and Puzo is one of the tightest and carefully constructed scripts of any movie. The film takes place completely within the world of the Corleone family, so we are never asked to hate these people nor sympathize with them. Yet we do, due to the countless scenes involving them eating, drinking, talking. There is a 30 minute wedding scene in the beginning that sets the mood and tone, showing how these people have taken advantage of the American dream. Now that we know them, we care for what happens to them despite the fact that they are evil.The acting is so powerful, so effective that it is impossible to think anyone could have filled these roles instead. Al Pacino, who was hated by the producers but loved by Coppola, plays Michael very straight and emotionless. His blank stare says everything and nothing, but all along we see change and it is his change of heart and personality that is the most amazing development in the whole film. James Caan is perfect as the hot-headed Sonny, Robert Duvall perfect as the level-headed Tom Hagen, and of course Marlon Brando overtakes everyone as the aging patriarch, Don Vito Corleone. Brando is usually considered the greatest actor ever, and here he goes full length, portraying a man who has been in America most of his life and is growing weary of the direction in which business seems to be going.The Godfather is one of the best films ever if only for the fact that it is able to suck you in completely to this world. It is long but never plods and always builds with every scene. Indeed, each early scene is somewhat of a set-up for something later. The actors all play it so straight and smooth, everything is completely convincing. And Gordon Willis' dark, moody photography adds to the drama, evoking hidden agendas and secrets. Nino Rota composed one of the most famous of all movie themes, and here it seems to tell us that life is going to get bad and we should have listened to Don Vito. This film put Coppola on the map and made him a director to reckon with. Just like the Corleones."
4907,False,"The Godfather tells us the tale of a Mafia family and their struggles to keep up with the changing times, and at the same time to value their own morals about family and friendship.This is an excellent movie, the cast ensemble is perfect and the subtle characterization of Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino is beyond recognition. Marlon Brando kicks up a great acting as the Godfather and at the same time a family man. Talia Shire is, as always, quite overacting, nevertheless that quality proved to be effective in this film.The story is unique in every aspect and convincing to the last scene. The irony presented within every climactic event in the story will put you in the edge of your seats and think ""How the heck did they come up to this idea?"" The way the twists are presented subtly, the absence of unessential brutality (which is present in almost every crime films these days), the hidden message of the story, the tragedy, the drama, the flawless direction, and most of all the realistic storyline that makes us infinitely more aware of the life experienced by a family whose business is crime-oriented. A very disturbing yet wonderful experience to watch this film.This is really one of the greatest ever made by the movie industry. You'll miss more than half of your life not watching it. :)"
4908,False,"The people who vote on the Internet Movie Database have ranked ""The Godfather"" as the greatest film ever in human history. Which is nothing to sneeze at, and deserves some seriously thought. I watched the film, thought it was great, but hardly found it to be the greatest film ever made. I mean, if you told me ""Citizen Kane"" was the greatest film ever made, I would wholeheartedly agree. And personally, as far as gangster movies go -- with or without Al Pacino -- I think the real choice should be ""Scarface"". But I'm not professionally trained as a movie critic, so maybe I'm missing something.I asked my supervisor and a co-worker about the film, and while they both thought the film was good, they really did not think it was some amazing masterpiece. My supervisor said, ""maybe it's good because it is so real"", but that's not a convincing reason and how ""real"" it is I cannot say for sure.If nothing else, the film might be great simply because it has become so clich√©. The horse head, the Marlon Brando voice, the gun behind the toilet and the line ""an offer he can't refuse"" are all part of pop culture these days (over 30 years later). But does being clich√© make the film great? I guess that would make ""Star Wars"" the greatest film ever made, which is certainly not true (though not a bad film by any means).And sure, you have powerful and memorable performances. James Caan is amazing, Marlon Brando is a bit over-the-top (a mumbling, lock-jawed godfather? sure...). And Al Pacino is of course great as always, maybe more so here than anywhere else. Not only does he have more range here than any other film than ""Scent of a Woman"" (more often than not he simply repeats a variation of his Michael Corleone role), but he is so young and plain that he is not even recognizable as Al Pacino in many scenes (I didn't recognize him until 30 minutes into the picture).I haven't yet mentioned the plot: an aging mafia boss (Marlon Brando) hands control over to his son (Al Pacino) when the father becomes ill, though he hoped never to do so since his son is Ivy League educated. Brando's role is actually quite small compared to the attention he is given (the film is really about Pacino coming of age).The directing is decent. Nothing special, but not awful, either. Very real and almost gritty (but not dark). The acting is great. The music is perfect. The only thing that really needed work was the fact that many of the Italian scenes had no subtitles and were thus lost in (lack of) translation. The entire Sciliy subplot and Appollonia were excellent and could not have been improved upon.I'm sure much more could have been said, but I'll cut myself off here. Certainly looking forward to Part II (though keeping my hopes and expectations low) and maybe someday I'll see Part III (though I've been warned not to)."
4909,False,"I saw this movie years ago, and I loved it. It was my favourite movie. This morning, I watched it again, and began to pick it apart.This movie is first and foremost overlong. Unnecessary dialogue and scenes weaken the raw effect that could have been produced. The musical sequence after Pacino does his restauant thing is unlike any other in the movie, it doesn't fit in. The part of the movie detailing Pacino's stay in Italy is poorly done, and also doesn't fit in.Some of the performances are dull, such as Keaton's, Lettieri, and Conti. Yes, I do believe Brando's part is badly written. I know I will be hated for saying this, but the character constantly changes, and his dialogue is never consistent. Brando does his best, and I don't think anyone could have done better, but it was still not a great part. The only outstanding performances were those of Caan and Pacino. Caan's acting is raw and Pacino is right on target.Besides the main theme, music is weak and unfitting. As I have said, some of the scenes don't fit, and the music score doesn't help any. At one moment, the movie is a gritty masterpiece, and  at another a cheesy, cliched piece of film, going back to the traditional style of film, ruining the film's effect. Had the movie cut all the silly dialogue, not to mention the sans-dialogue scenes that aren't even poetic, which a dialogueless scene should be, the effect might  be better.Also, to throw some more mud, the romance between Keaton and Pacino is awful, and no chemistry is arisen.A disappointment, but not to be missed. I recommend a single viewing. One more thing, this film certainly doesn't deserve to be the best ever, it shouldn't even be in the top one hundred, but it doesn't deserve a ""1"" rating, I only give it that because I want the average rating to go down."
4910,False,"I saw Godfather when it came out. I don't remember the movie but I remember going out to the lobby 2-3 times to get away from it and take a break. It was soooooooooooooo boring. It was like it was in slow motion or something and I just didn't care about anyone or anything including the plot.I recall hearing that Brando stuffed cotton balls in his cheeks to get that effect and I couldn't not think about it during the movie. It looks like a lot of movie was spent on this movie to create the look of a certain era but so what.I could see people's lips moving and hear people talking but the dialog might as well have been entirely in Italian as I had trouble paying attention. My mind would wander and I really didn't follow the plot or care. For some reason, the dialog seemed trapped in the movie itself as though I was watching it through a window that was muffling the sound a bit. Weird.Many people may think this is the best movie ever but many people also thought the earth was flat in 1491. When it comes to movies, it only matters to me what I think."
4911,False,"To understand this films acclaim you have to understand censorship in America. Wikipedia has a nice section on the 'Production Code'. In short nothing remotely like this film was seen for decades. So when it was released it was a revelation for American movie audiences. In todays light the film doesn't have the same impact it did back then. The script isn't written that well, the dialogue is labored and dull. Though Brando is amazing and deserved all the accolades he got from the film. The plot is labored as well and drags in many parts. The enemies of the Corleone family aren't 3-d enough to really be too invested in the power struggles. In fact things don't really seem to be alive as in other mobster films like Goodfellas. The illusion of reality here isn't complete. Godfather II is by far the tauter and better film, and the best in the series."
4912,False,"I loved this movie. I've seen it many times. I also bought the PS2 game which made me interested in it once again. I love all the characters especially Marlon Brando. He had a lot of good advice in this movie for those who refused his offers. Great one liners in this movie also. James Caan was a hot head and great at playing Sonny. Michael was great. What can you say about any aspect of this movie that is not great and flawless? The sets, language etc. are amazing. I watched this and Godfather 2 on the same week. I can't wait to see the new commentary by the director. I am so looking forward to it. How can you see a better movie? The horse head in the bed was amazing also."
4913,False,"Before giving a summary of this classic, let me just say that this is ""The Masterpiece of all Masterpieces"" when it comes to movies. When I review movies, I consider the godfather as the greatest of all time and rate the movies according. There is no greater movie than this one.Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando, is The Godfather of the ""Corleone Family Mafia"". Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) returns from war with no intention of joining the family business. Bad blood between the heads of the five families cause a shooting on Don Vito, which keeps Michael away from Kay Adams(Diane Keaton), his girlfriend, and closer to his family with Sonny (James Caan), Fredo(John Cazale), Connie(Taila Shire), and family lawyer Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall). Sonny takes over the family business through Don Vito's bad health and takes very aggressive action. A war is created between the heads of the family, leading to assassinations, betrayal, revenge, and suffering on all parts. To end this chaos, Michael Corleone takes over the family business with his father as his adviser.The movie is absolutely flawless. The lighting is incredible. It's so dark at some points that Brando's eyes are shadowed. The acting is insanely great. Brando does a better acting job in The Godfather, than he does in On the Waterfront. Pacino's acting is superb. He stars in his first major role, leading to many great performances following. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton give great performances as well. The movie received 4 Oscar nominations for acting alone(Brando in leading role/ Pacino, Caan, and Duvall in supporting role). The movie was nominated for 11 academy awards and won 3 of them (Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Marlon Brando)in 1972.Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect that a critic looks for. It is highly entertaining, shocking, and tear jerking of epic proportions.I highly recommend this movie."
4914,False,"If there was a zero out of 10, that's what I'd give it.I know so many people hear the movie title, ""The Godfather"" and automatically feel like praising that movie, that whole trilogy, to the high heavens. Well, I don't care if it was made well...apart from how it was made, the movie was bad and I'm still upset that my philosophy teacher made me suffer through the whole trilogy. Boring...slow...just plain snooze-ville.I'm probably going to have an angry mob coming after me for speaking of the movie this way, but it's my opinion...and I'm sure I'm not alone in feeling this way."
4915,False,"Title says it all.... This movie was long, and cut out the best parts of the book.  It had a good cast, but that can't make up for poor transition from the novel. Bottom line: read the book, it's better."
4916,False,"why are people trying to make this film out to be something it is not??!this has got to be one of the worst films i have ever seen. I mean come on, what a load of tripe.I could get more enjoyment out of watching The Erotic Witch Project 2 (although I have to admit is pretty classy, the acting is superb, well done girls, you really do look and sound like you are cuming there!!)Where is all the action the makes a mafia film class, like Goodfella's.Marlon Brando's acting didn't deserve an oscar, it deserved a slap in the face. Sean Connery's performance as a spaniard in Highlander was more convincing.Al Pacino's performance is total rubbish. The only good part he can do is a queer and that's in Dog Day afternoon.As and for the director, Paul Verhoeven did a better job with Showgirls!!What is wrong with a bit of rape in a film, this is the mafia we are watching on the screen, if they are going to portray what the mafia are really like, then at least show what they do behind closed door.Very Poor!!!! 1 out of 10!!!"
4917,False,"The Godfather used to hold the top spot in IMDb's Top 250 movies list; it now sits at number two, behind Frank Darabont's emotionally manipulative crowd-pleaser The Shawshank Redemption, which has become the go-to title for people who can't be arsed to think for themselves when it comes to naming their favourite film. People clearly aren't showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?).In my opinion, Francis Ford Coppola's sweeping Mafia epic (based on Mario Puza's bestselling novel) trumps Shawshank in every way¬ÖThe film boasts a superior cast headed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with excellent support from James Caan and Robert Duvall; Tom Robbins and Morgan Fairchild are simply no match.Coppola's storytelling is impeccable from start to finish, drawing the viewer into the film as inextricably as Michael Corleone (Pacino) is drawn into the sinister, violent underworld of Sicilian organised crime. Darabont does a reasonable enough job at papering over Shawshank's plot holes, but fails to lend his film the sense of style and class so evident in every scene of the Godfather.Nino Rota's score for Coppola's movie is sublime, a majestic piece of music so emotive that just a few notes evoke an entire genre. I can't even recall Shawshank's score.Rather unsurprisingly, The Shawshank Redemption deals with the theme of redemption, and closes with a contrived feel-good ending. The Godfather is darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour, obligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and trust; it doesn't sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead with Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid. Perfectamundo (that's Italian for 'perfect'. Possibly).In short, The Godfather is the don in every department."
4918,False,"Let's talk about what many people call the greatest movie of all time: Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather. Released in 1972, it took the world by storm, becoming the highest-grossing movie of all time and ushering in a new era of film. Centering around a New York mob family and the descent into darkness of young Michael Corleone, played famously and fantastically by Al Pacino, it took us fully out of the Hays Code era and showed what film could do with mature subject matter.It is also wonderfully acted, stunningly scored, scorchingly directed, and thrillingly cinematographed. When someone says 'The Godfather', a detailed series of images pop into my mind, a series of images distinct from every other film series in the world. It could copyright its aesthetic, an aesthetic that fits its tone and mood like climatic battles fit action movies or long kisses fit romance movies or sunsets fit the island of Santorini.This film won five Academy Awards. I can safely that is too low. There is nothing in these films that is any less than the finest filmmaking ever produced. It is the work of a group of men and women at the height of their prowess. Pacino has starred in some terrible movies over the last twenty-five years, including the one that one him an Oscar. And Coppola? The best thing he did after the 70's were adaptations of teen novels. Now, doesn't that seem backwards to you? You're supposed to start off making adaptations of teen novels and move on to 'serious', 'adult' fare afterwards.But none of that matters, not really. You don't remember Audrey Hepburn as an old woman dying of caner in the 90's. You think of her as one of the influential symbols of the 50's and 60's. And so it is here. Coppola could have jumped off a bridge in 1980, leaving little Sofia without a father. That would have a terrible tragedy, but for better or for worse, it would not be the first thing people remember about him. People die. Art survives. Good art grows. And this is certainly good art.The next time I watch this movie, I should do a full analysis. It'd take a day or so, and it'd probably run over 30 pages, but I think it's be worth it. There are so many themes at play here. There is enough symbolism floating around to drive someone bad. As a general rule of thumb, if it looks symbolic, it probably is.There are so many memorable quotes from this movie. I hope you guys don't mind me closing out this review by posting a slew of them.""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" ""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli."" ""It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes."" ""In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns."" ""I believe in America."" ...Okay, I'm not seriously gonna stop the review. But you get my point. And none of these quotes come at the expense of telling a great story. Many scripts pick between being watertight and being evocative. This one is both, and because of that, all these lines stick in the audience's mind.One of the greatest lies of cinema is that the lines people remember are the best lines in any given film. If that were true, we'd have stoned college kids and vapid teenage blondes quoting long, flowery speeches instead of catchphrases. People remember lines in films because 1) the lines are important to the plot, 2) the lines are not something that would normally be spoken, and 3) the lines are delivered well.The people who make animated kids' films have a tendency to forget steps 1 and 3.Throughout the history of filmmaking, there has never been a film both as good and as iconic as The Godfather. When people talk about films, it is one of the first to come to mind.In my opinion, it is the face of American filmmaking. Of all the films I have watched, none have more accurately portrayed what it is to be American. Yes, this a film about crime and the mafia. But it is also a film about identity and opportunity and progress and transition and cutthroat business and hope and fear and assimilation and betrayal and broken dreams and uncertainty and family and traditionalism and modernism and ascending and descending.Annie Hall and especially Manhattan are love letters to NYC. This is a love letter to America. But it is also a hate letter. It explores both sides of the American Dream. It explores the highs and lows and temptations and opportunity everyone faces as they try to make it in this country. It is explores this glorious mess of a land.Not much else I can say. If you haven't yet seen it, see it."
4919,False,"I'm a fan of Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco as well as The Sopranos, but maybe because I didn't warm up to or really care about the Corleone family, I can't understand the high and to my mind excessive praise this film receives even if I understand its popularity. The characters are shallow and one-dimensional yet the film takes them seriously and treats them with gravity; there isn't a shred of irony or humor in this nearly 3 hour film. I didn't find the numerous scenes of the family's business dealings compelling, nor was I persuaded by the film's attempts to draw a parallel between organized crime and business and politics. And Talia Shire, Robert Duvall, Morgana King, Brando, Caan, and Pacino never felt like a family to me; they rarely if ever are all together, and does the Godfather ever meet or talk with Michael's wife Kaye? Brando's performance is an impressive stunt, but it's really a supporting role and the Old Don's manner of speaking becomes tiresome as does the film's solemn pacing. Pacino is the film's star and he is excellent and convincing in his transformation from fresh-faced to poker face. Diane Keaton's Kaye is unbelievably naive, and Talia Shire as Connie carries the melodramatic scenes including a fight with her husband that is redolent of so many other scenes of marital discord. Morgana King as mama Corleone is not a character or a felt presence; she's mere background And though most of the characters are guilty of betrayal, double crossing and murder, I actually developed more sympathy for some of the Corleone's victims notably Tessio and Moe Green than I did for them."
4920,False,"This movie is directed wonderfully. Dialogs are good. You don't even know how 3 hours are passed away. Al Pacino's acting takes movie to whole another level. The good news is that The Godfather has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances, unprecedented visuals and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall.Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes."
4921,False,"This is certainly one of the greatest movies ever made. It's such amazingly well-acted, well-written movie with an epic story line that takes you through many themes like love, sadness, loyalty, revenge and betrayal is such an encompassing and totally believable way. I will never get tired of watching this masterpiece. ""The Godfather"" is one of the few gangster films that connects the members of the Mafia as a family. The cinematography is rich and the music is perfect. However, I failed to see how Marlon Brando's performance was top notch. His acting was decent; he did not move much nor talk much. His voice also was barely understandable due to his croaking voice mumbling what sounded like English. Ultimately ""The Godfather"" still stands up as the best movie in the American crime gen"
4922,False,"Of all the movies I love and admire, I just have to say The Godfather is my favourite movie ever. I could go on forever talking about how great it is. It's beautiful to watch from the opening monologue to the closing-door ending. I know it's kind of clich√© to call The Godfather your favourite movie but I mean how could you not? It's pretty much perfect in every way: perfect acting, perfect directing, perfect writing, perfect pacing, perfect music, perfect cinematography etc. Not to mention it has one of the greatest actors of all time, Marlon Brando in one of the most iconic performances of all time and it helped restore his career. And it made actors like the great Al Pacino a superstar. In fact, The Godfather changed everything in terms of movie-making. Anyone who loves movies, should definitely see The Godfather. It's too bad Marlon Brando wasn't present at the Oscars in 1973 because it would've been amazing to see him give on speech on winning the award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for a second time and thanking everyone involved with The Godfather.But even I'm surprised to call The Godfather my favourite movie ever because I'm not mad on gangster movies. Like I think Goodfellas is really overrated and I think Scarface with Al Pacino is nothing special. But I also think The Godfather: Part II is a masterpiece as well even though it's not as good as the original and it doesn't feel the same without Marlon Brando. Though I've never watched The Godfather: Part III but it's considered by many to be very disappointing so I choose to stay away from it. But in conclusion, to put it rather bluntly, if you don't like The Godfather, it's hard to believe you like movies."
4923,False,"I liked it a lot. It's truly a masterpiece. I thought he cast was well priced and he director did a phenomenal job at directing this film. I also think the sequel is as good as the first, if not better. If I could give this film more than 10 stars right now, I honestly would. I remember going with my boyfriend to see it, for it is his favorite film. He laughed and cried and wanted to see it again and again. I am the same exact way. I not only likes this movie, but I loved it, and I still do. Even now when I see a grandfather clock I always think of this movie. Actually, writing this review right now is giving me so many amazing and beautiful memories of the movie that I want to go and see it again. I would truly recommend see this movie as soon as possible. I'm sure you wouldn't regret it. It made me the person I am today."
4924,False,One of the greatest stories ever told through film. From the cinematography to the cast there isn't a single flaw.The performance by Marlon Brando is just stunning and Al Pacino amazes with his talent with this being one of his first movies. The legacy of this movie and the way it has affected cinema cant be described in words. Being a fan of organized crime movies I can say that this is my absolute favorite and I cant remember how many times I have watched it.It might be a bit long but It never ceases to amaze the viewer with its brilliant dialogue and excellent cinematography.I would like to thank personally everyone who worked on this achievement of a film. A must see for everyone who has even the slightest appreciation for cinema!!!
4925,False,"The Godfather is not only a great Noir style gangster movie but also a tale of the immigrants that came to this country in the last part of the 1800's through the depression. Poor families from Europe that came to the land of the free only to find that all the wealth was controlled by the land barons, Bankers and well to do. Like Most parents Vito Corleone did what he had to do to raise his family and never wanted this life for his sons. Realizing his words were lost on Sonny and Fredo who was a sickly child did not have much hope of making it on his own. But Michael was different he went to college then into the service in WW2. He was never supposed to be in that world but the attempt on his fathers life makes him realize he is his fathers son. He swears revenge on Salatso and the police captain that protects him and so the story unravels. Great performances By Brando, Caan, Pacino,Duvall,with an incredible supporting cast with Abe Vigoda,Richard Castalano, Diane Keaton and Talia SHire. Perhaps the best of the supporting cast is John Cazale as Fredo Supposedly not the brightest bulb in the bunch turns out to be a very good schemer who wants whats coming to him."
4926,False,"This was truly a history rival and fascinating piece of cinematography. The godfather was one of my favorite and classical films from a he series. Its involves mystery, action, crime, food and the mafia some of my favorite subjects for a good film. I particularly like the entire Godfather Trilogy but personally the first one is my absolute favorite. The scene where everyone has dinner and the party shows how caring and loving the family. Also when all the families meet together to discuss the ""buisness of the mafia was awesome. Then all of sonny dramatic scenes were just hilariously funny but it was sad yet obvious sonny temper was get him into trouble one day. Then when Michael took over I could see he reflected his father a lot"
4927,False,"Francis Ford Coppola's screen adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather is a cinematic master piece. The thought provoking irony that shrouds the film leaves the audience astounded by the excellence of the work. The characters are all very dynamic and go through extensive amounts of growth throughout the duration of the film. The use of irony, antithesis, and juxtaposition create such a complex story above and below the surface. Although the movie is very complex and layered, it is not too difficult to follow. It is long, so if you want to get the most of the experience I recommend watching it in installments rather than all at once. It will make the movie easier to follow and keep your attention span fresh. There is a lot of violence, but it is not overly gory. It's more tasteful than films of the Tarantino nature. So, leave your guns behind, grab a cannoli and enjoy this exemplary film full of plot and grade A acting."
4928,False,"Masterpiece in true sense..Right people! coming together for the, Right script ! at the, Right Time!Coppola nailed it in every aspect. Yes the movie is long but packs in itself a plethora of epic performances. The main role was tailored-made for Marlon Brandon. What this movie is and will always be is far Micheal.. a star that was bone from this movie. Al Pacino's character Michael is immortal and sets the screen on fire whenever is walks into the frame.If you love cinema, watch it.. watch it again and again and again.. Glory Glory Godfather!"
4929,False,"I don't think in all my viewings of movies have I seen such excellent direction, acting and writing. ""The Godfather"" is so brilliant in almost every way that I don't see how anyone could NOT call it a masterpiece. Michael Corleone, one of three sons of his mob boss father Don Vito, returns home from the war for his sister's wedding. Soon after his return, Don Corleone is wounded in a mob hit and Michael wants to strike back. Michael eliminates a corrupt cop and a competing mafioso in public, and escapes to Sicily. While Michael is gone, the Corleone family begins to fall apart.Marlon Brando gives a powerful and influential performance that is the best of his career with the exception of ""Last Tango in Paris"". Al Pacino also does very well, and he continues to do so in the later two installments of the trilogy! James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton also give great performances for the supporting characters. Coppola is smart with the directing as he doesn't make the film necessarily about shootouts or pure murders, though there is a big amount of violence, but instead he shows how it affects the people who have something to do with them. It is a series of ""family"" events that build up to a devastating ending. Nino Rota's eerie score highly adds to the atmosphere of the film.This film, it's sequel and ""Apocalypse Now"" were the only true modern classics that Coppola made, and launched the careers of Al Pacino and Diane Keaton, two of Hollywood's finest actors and two of my favorites. It is everything that films like ""Scarface (1983)"" tried to be and should have been, and without this film I doubt that ""Once Upon a Time in America"", ""Goodfellas"", ""The Untouchables"" and many others would have ever been made. ""The Godfather"" is the definite great film that should be viewed by anyone who calls themselves a cinematic movie buff. 5/5"
4930,False,"Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies enjamb√© off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can't. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a clich√©. His performance though was not a clich√©. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable."
4931,False,"I am 15 at the time of writing this review, and all the movies I have watched made before 1980 I didn't enjoy. It probably wasn't the films' fault; it's just I'm used to movies with realistic CGI effects, HD quality and current actors, but nonetheless I often found the films' quality too grainy to bear and the effects too cheap to appreciate. It was like this for every film until I watched The Godfather. First of all, for a film made in 1972 its film quality is superb! Also, though I didn't recognise the actors I knew they were talented. Even the ones not essential to the story. An example of this is the man in the first scene coming to the Godfather for help. His emotions seemed real, and he perfectly delivered his lines in a single, lengthly shot. In conclusion, this movie still holds up to this generation, even those like me who generally dislike old movies. It's the best start to a trilogy that I've ever seen!"
4932,False,"This film represents the absolute perfection, either in cinematography or acting. The perfects book's perfect adaptation. The only minor ""problem"" is that this and the Part II are complete each other, one by one these movies are less, but this little detail won't minor their merits. In the lead role Al Pacino was the best choice, and don't forget to mention the legend, Marlon Brando as THE Godfather. I think this film represents what nowadays movie are lack of. In this movie the story and the characters are the main parts not the visual effects. In my opinion to this very day, this was Coppola's best directing. And don't forget Nino Rota's melodies which are inseparable from the movie."
4933,False,"One of the best movies ever made about the mafia until today! I'm still waiting that arises a work like this movie. Violent and realistic, is a perfect picture of how the mafia could be good and cruel at the same time. Full of meaning, deaths and colorful characters, is absolutely impossible to peel off eyes of the screen for a second even. Is an epic about a descent into hell and desperate attempts to see the light again. And the rise of credits, the viewer realizes that he was facing one of the most powerful stories of love and hatred of the cinema.The Godfather is without a doubt one of my 5 favorite movies, one of the most important films in history, the most commented, imitated and revered in cinema. And is the question: is the best movie ever? When we stop to think about days after seeing the movie we were in doubt, but to watch no doubt of the answer. Almost like an offer we can't refuse. Note: 10"
4934,False,"As the film opens, it is the last Saturday in August, 1945 - the Japanese have just surrendered. In the opening scene of the film, the camera (very slowly) pulls back from the face of a man who is in Corleone's dark home office, where the Don regally and ruthlessly holds court. He carries on with the crime family business during his daughter's wedding reception, that is being held in the bright, sunshiny outdoor veranda of his Long Island compound. According to Corleone's Irish-German overseer and surrogate son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall): ""It's part of the wedding. No Sicilian can refuse any request on his daughter's wedding day."" It is the custom of the father of the bride to grant favors and promises to all petitioners and supplicants who pay homage.Seated in front of the Don's desk is an undertaker named Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto), speaking in a heavy accent (Vito Corleone's wife is god-mother to Bonasera's daughter). Bonasera desperately pleads for a favor - proper vengeful ""justice"" (rather than American justice) for the threatened near-rape and brutal beating suffered by his daughter (whom he raised ""in the American fashion"") by her non-Italian boyfriend and his friend. The two brutes had received a court date and only a suspended sentence:I believe in America. America has made my fortune. And I raised my daughter in the American fashion. I gave her freedom, but - I taught her never to dishonor her family. She found a boyfriend, not an Italian...Two months ago, he took her for a drive, with another boyfriend. They made her drink whiskey. And then they tried to take advantage of her. She resisted. She kept her honor. So they beat her like an animal...She was the light of my life - my beautiful girl. Now she will never be beautiful again...I-I went to the police like a good American. These two boys were brought to trial. The judge sentenced them to three years in prison - suspended sentence. Suspended sentence! They went free that very day! I stood in the courtroom like a fool. And those two bastards, they smiled at me. Then I said to my wife, 'for justice, we must go to Don Corleone.'"
4935,False,"I'm not gonna write another review of how great and flawless the Godfather is because there are already a lot of them and pretty much everyone knows how perfect the movie is. Instead, I'm gonna share my 17year old guy view of this masterpiece and thus i'll highlight the importance of it. First things first, yes I like blockbuster kind of movies (you know the types) and i've absolutely adored what cinema has brought in, the past 10 years... But, I've seen many movies from the 50's-80's unlike my generation and i have to say that i am fond of 2/10 of them (The 90's, especially 1994 is a happy exception). That being said you cant imagine how big it is that this movie is my 2nd favorite of all time in all of 400+ movies i've seen...! The pacing is incredible, the picture is meant to be timeless, the sound is captivating, the plot is classic, and don't get me started on the performances. Marlon Brando, the greatest actor to have walked on this earth, proved why he is the best with ,maybe, the best performance of all time. I'd seen the streetcar and on the waterfront and i could believe in my eyes... It's a shame it has a rating of 9.2/10 because it truly is at least 9.9/10... even for an objective voting. This generation that spends 15 bucks for 1,5 hour of explosions every summer and another 15 for useless moneymaker ""movies"" will never know the greatness of this 3hour epic... a true masterpiece!!! 10/10!"
4936,False,"In my Opinion this is one of the best (if not the best) movie ever done. Francis Ford Copolla does such a great job, that You want to watch it over and over. The actors are picked so carefully and good, that you couldn't imagine others playing those characters. The movie portrays the sicilian mafia and the problems the godfather has to face pretty perfect. Compared to other gangster movies like Goodfellas for example, The Godfather has definitely a longer and more interesting story.If you haven't watched it, you definitely should. With 175 minutes running time the movie is quite long, but I promise it is worth it."
4937,False,"Just an amazing movie with an awesome script! One of the best stories ever told. The way this story is told is something that I couldn't expect, with so much drama but also the reality of that world. We feel so connected with the family, with the characters. The photography increase the drama of the movie. Like the last take, we want so much to see how his going to be with all that power. Absolutely worth watching this movie, especially. You are learning from the very best. It's also the kind of a movie that every time that I watch I can see something different. Very honest with the book. Almost three hours that we can't feel. I wish there were more movies like this these days."
4938,False,"This movie is my favorite. I literally have this movie on every device that I own. And that just tells you how much I love this movie. I mean every scene is a classic.When we can't pick a movie to watch, me and my friends just instinctively settle for ""The Godfather"". We know each and every dialogue and we love saying the dialogues verbatim! Besides, what other movie has so many great actors doing their best work? Where else will you find someone beating Al Pacino at acting then in this movie? This movie just never gets old for me and my friends. And that is why it deserves a 10 star vote!"
4939,False,"I Think this film is best in cinema history.one awesome film. alpacino was great in film i like his play Brando was strong kind and square!godfather best dialoge:Luca Brasi: Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. Don Corleone: I'm gonna make him an offer he won't refuse. Clemenza: Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. Michael: Just lie here, Pop. I'll take care of you now. I'm with you now. I'm with you. Michael: My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. Kay Adams: Do you know how naive you sound, Michael? Presidents and senators don't have men killed. Michael: Oh. Who's being naive, Kay? Don Corleone: You talk about veangance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you or my boy to me? Peter Clemenza: Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. Michael: Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever. Michael: Barzini is dead. So is Phillip Tattaglia. Moe Greene. Stracci. Cuneo. Today I settled all family business so don't tell me that you're innocent. Admit what you did...Get him a drink. Don't be afraid, Carlo. Come on, you think I'd make my sister a widow? I'm Godfather to your son...Go ahead. Drink. Drink. No, you're out of the family business, that's your punishment. You're finished. I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas. Tom?...I want you to stay there, you understand?...Only don't tell me that you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and it makes me very angry. Now, who approached you first? Barzini or Tattaglia? Michael Corleone: Don't ask me about my business!!"
4940,False,"you need to watch it to understand how excellent this movie is. It has a great story, actors, acting and is a piece of art. This was my first English movie and loved it and still do. Never will get tired of watching it. ""Don't ever take sides against the family again, ever and Never hate your enemies, it affects your judgement.""Many quotes and words that actually make sense, its not a wordless and nonsense argument. It can be extreme but some of the quotes do make sense.Watch, See, Listen, and enjoy."
4941,False,"""The Godfather"" is perhaps one of the greatest films of all time. For me, this film is remarkable, as the authors have managed to create an indescribable atmosphere of Sicily and the mores that reigned there. When you watch the film you think that even the smell of streets, herbs and flowers. A magical music does not leave any chances to watch this movie with popcorn. Definitely, a great film! Great director, cinematographer and composer! In addition, it is deeply Sorcerer movie makes you think and analyze life, the finer points of human relations, reveals the true values ‚Äã‚Äãof life. Great game actors, watching where you wake up in empathy. This is my favorite movie."
4942,False,"As argued by Tom Hanks in You've Got Mail, ""The Godfather meets all the vital questions that come your way in life."" Although for that reason I never would eat oranges: every time someone takes one of those citrus or play with them in the film, has every chance to perish. Maybe because a film that begins without credits, with a speech in which in its initial nine words patriotism, immigration, business, honor, beliefs and hard reality blend (""I believe in America. America has made my fortune ""), and that there does not fail until the final climax, even the high treason-the Michael Corleone takes himself, his beliefs, because the family is above oneself-can not be bad. For Coppola lived to the limit on the set, with the constant feeling that was going to be fired, the producer Robert Evans and Paramount nor were giving truce, nor would leave to finish a film in which he did not believe the beginning (the end of the day, it was about something far removed from his life, the Mafia and was based on a best-seller); and that pressure came the juice of talent, the essence that inspired the new Hollywood. Because Marlon Brando did a test to be hired him, he refused to do so. For young boys came of interpretation: Al Pacino, John Cazale (which only made five films before dying of cancer, but do five jobs), Diane Keaton, James Caan and Robert de Niro reinforcement for the second part. Because neither the music of Nino Rota or photography Gordon Willis have a second of weakness. Because we all love to say what the ""offer he could not refuse"" and think you can get into the bed of an enemy head of a horse. For these reasons and many others, The Godfather is the best movie ever."
4943,False,"This is one of those movies that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business.The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the movie is the definition of a great epic. I feel that this movie has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.Do not miss this movie!"
4944,False,"I saw this movie and i fell in love with it. It is the strongest movie i have ever seen .This movie gave a clear and transparent view of ""The Mafia Family"".This movie defines what cinema is(are).Four Thumbs Up!!!! for ""The Godfather"" and i hope everybody who watches this movies falls in love with it. Marlon Brando,i got no words for his appreciation what shall i tell him ""The Real Godfather of Actors"" yes that would be very less to call him so he is above that also. He was born to do Don Vitto Corleone and Don Vitto Corleone was written for him only.Al Pacino,ah what a strong Performance speechless,boundless loved him as Michael Corleone The real Son of The Godfather just can say this.and James Caan,Robert Duvall and Diana Keaton are also the important part without them ""The Godfather"" would be incomplete.just wanna say watch it"
4945,False,"This may be regarded as the best film of the entire history of cinema, it is almost perfect in all respects, photography, script, editing, all with great technique and art at the same time, I find it significant errors.All the performances are great, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, etc.. All individually and collectively make a masterpiece of interpretation.The script is perhaps most shocking, the story of a reluctant to participate in the murky family business man, and the gradual change of their convictions through circumstances, recreates a picture of that violent era of U.S. history. Photographic techniques are also impressive, not only for the beauty of the image, but also for the handling of camera you are carrying the story gets very intense feelings in the viewer.A film that nobody should miss."
4946,False,"Francis Ford Coppola directs this masterful, brilliantly acted(Marlon Brando, Academy Award winner, Al Pacino, James Caan, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall among many others) and supremely well-crafted film about the saga of the Corleones, a Mafia family who find themselves in changing times, and their struggles to adapt. Aging Don Vito Corleone must pick a successor, but a violent war among a rival family, and betrayal from within, threaten to shatter this close-knit family.Long, but not over-long, this moves at a fantastic pace, and is among the most engrossing films ever made, many memorable scenes and lines.A masterpiece."
4947,False,"When I first saw The Godfather many years ago, I initially called the film ""a long, boring piece of crap."" Luckily as I have matured, so have my tastes in cinema. This film is heralded as an American classic, and now I can wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. As famed critic Roger Ebert pointed out, this movie is the one where most people can agree on its quality. Ultimately, The Godfather is still a very long movie but I have come to appreciate it more with each viewing. The film is obviously about the mafia, but this is a different kind of mafia film. Prior mafia films and even those after this one deals with perspectives from an outsider and their perceptions of violence and death with the mafia. However, this film is told within the confinements of a mafia family. The story is told within the inside and that was a unique story angle at that time. I like how the film doesn't show corruption from the mafia family, the Corleones. There are no civilian casualties from organized crime and the only corrupt person in the film is in the form of a police officer. Don Corleone doesn't believe in dealing with drugs, because of how they affect people. The themes of the Corleone family and the movie itself is family and loyalty. As Michael Corleone points out in the movie, ""never take sides against the family."" That is when crazy things begin to happen.The beginning of the movie is very crucial. It is basically a large wedding scene with scenes intercut of Don Corleone in his darkened office taking care of family business. This beginning is important for several reasons. We get the tone of the film and we understand who the Corleone family is. This is also where all the characters are introduced and explained. By the time the scene is over, we get the big picture of the film and we get a sense where the film is heading. The scene is a bit long, but I felt director Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job on introducing all of his main characters in the filmThis is a film about family and it takes advantage of the classic structure of handing power between generations. The patriarch of the family is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the head of one of the most powerful mafia families. His children, who play a huge factor in the family, are Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Connie (Talia Shire), and Fredo (John Cazale). Also playing a huge role is the family lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The aging Vito decides to transfer power to one of his subalterns, and that causes a ripple between the five Mafia families in New York. The main child here is Michael, who didn't want anything to do with his family and instead join the military. But after Vito is shot, Mike decides to join the family business and take control.The acting is absolutely fantastic. Marlon Brando delivered one of the best performances of his career as the aging head of the family. He is known for using his devices in the beginning such as his puffy cheeks and the cat on his lap. The way he delivered his dialogue in such a soft-spoken voice is also very memorable. Al Pacino does a very good job, taking wise advice from his father while delivering on his own counsel. This is the beginning for Pacino's illustrious career. Robert Duvall does a fantastic job as Hagen. Duvall has had a legendary career, but the one role I think of every time I reflect on his career is his role as Tom Hagen. James Caan does a great job as the quick-tempered Sonny.The one thing that does irk me about the film is the use of women. It seems like women has no part of the family. Mike's sister, Connie (played solidly by Talia Shire) is only used for a target of her husband's Carlo anger. He treats her like a piece of filth. Although, Mike does have a special place in his heart for Connie. Mike also has a romantic interest in the film named Kay Adams (played by the eccentric Diane Keaton). I didn't think Kay was a strong character in the film. Also, Vito has a wife but she is just an insignificant shadow only meant for the family pictures. Finally, there is a Sicilian woman we meet. After Michael goes on exile in Sicily for shooting a cop who played a role in the shooting of his father, he falls in love with this girl¬Ö..but she ends up getting blown up. My only qualm abut the film is how little importance women play in it.Also playing a huge role in the film is the music. Coppola traveled to Italy to find a composer who can bring an Italian feeling to the film. His find, Nino Rota did just that. The main title is heavily influenced by Italian culture and it gave an authentic feeling to the film-as the main characters are an Italian family. It's a shame that the Academy snubbed his music, because I felt it should have won an Oscar. It's one of my favorite all-time scores.Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 3 of them including Best Picture, The Godfather is one of America's most influential films. The movie remains popular to this day and if you haven't seen the film, you should see it. It's almost three hours long, but this is a portrait of a mafia family that is all about family. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job directing this film from the very popular novel written by Mario Puzo. The Godfather is an instant American classic.My Grade: A-"
4948,False,"One of the great movies of its time. Before, and even now is admire as one of the most classic and greatest films of all time. And I agree. I remember when I first watched it I never thought that Sonny would be the one killed, and Michael being the one taking over the family, and ruling with an iron fist. I have to watch at least one or two times a year."
4949,False,"The first movie I've ever watched that left me with the feeling that I saw something bigger than just a movie. I remember it really well - I was 16, my parents were abroad and I watched it at home with a couple of good friends. When you remember the time and setting you watched a movie so well, it is because it really touched you and influenced you, and that's what I think that movie did to me. You really should watch it. It is an offer you can't refuse!"
4950,False,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable."
4951,False,"I have to be honest - I first watched this at about 19 years old, and I did not like it much. I thought it was slow, and I missed a lot of the subtleties throughout the movie.However, having watched it recently at 32, I am more appreciative of the slow-burn classic that this movie is. The acting is superb, and it feels like everything - even scenes, time periods that are left out of the movie - is intentional. The sequel makes this movie experience even better, as it once again makes you ponder the unknown gap between Part 1 and Part 2. Maybe that's addressed in the novels, I don't know.Furthermore, this movie is complete with an epic finale that still blows my mind. I get so sick of movies that have that 'Stephen King Fizzle' nowadays!"

4953,False,"Could it get any better than the Godfather? Classic film with iconic plot twists, incredible performances and an overall feeling of ""familia""...no wonder it stands the test of time.

4954,False,"I hope nobody minds, but there was some discussion about missing English subtitles in the Louis Restaurant meeting scene with Michael and Sollozzo, and I had difficulty finding any apart from a general translation found here which does little to help beat and continuity.I think this effort does the trick, it fits the dialogue as far as I can tell, not being even passing fluent in Italian.

4956,False,"Ladies and gentlemen, if you have watched The Godfather than you have witnessed what can be called the greatest movie of all time! Simply flawless.The Godfather aged like fine wine the older it gets the better it is.Great plot, legendary acting and directing, violent, bold and no gangster movie is as nearly as good as The Godfather. The Italians sure know how to make great gangster movie. This movie proved to everyone that Marlon Brando is the best actor in the world and started the career of the legendary Al Pacino, this says something. If you are starving for greatness watch The Godfather it is nothing less than a masterpiece and if you have seen it, take a bow!"
4957,False,"I am not a big fan of the sequels even the second is a big step down from this one. What a cast? Like an earlier reviewer said; REWATCHABLE!! Yes, I am Italian, not a Sicilian, and I have seen it hundreds of times. What a cast: Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall. Even the supporting cast is excellent with the film noir legend Richard Conte as Barzini. Puzo wrote such a rich, deep script. The characters suck you in and are so lifelike. Each brother is radically different from the other. Fredo, the mama's boy, the useless one who Michael kills off in the second one. Sonny, the human volcano, with a temper that has to be seen to be believed. Michael, the quiet and deadly one most like Vito but colder more ruthless. Michael was always outside the family looking in; he was held in contempt by the rest as the soft college boy who didn't want to get his hands dirty. This is the answer to the riddle of how he could kill Fredo, his own brother, later in the second one. Notice where he sits at the wedding, as far away from the family as he can get."
4958,False,"Marlon Brando's old flame that has glowed for years, and flickered along a trail bumpy with mediocre pictures, shines higher and brighter than ever. The old irresistible magic is revived in Paramount's ""The Godfather"" in his intuitive grasp of Mario Puzo's Don Corleone, a living symbol of the poetic translation of his name, the lionhearted.Brando is cool as the godfather, sagacious head of the Corleone ""family,"" most powerful of the five ""families"" of organized crime in New York. He is relaxed as the loving, indulgent patriarch of his large blood family, in his mansion behind an iron fence in Long Beach, L.I. And he is terrifically appealing as the man who cheats death, recovers from bullet wounds inflicted by a rival gang, recuperates at home to enjoy his garden and grandchildren until he dies of old age. Once he comes out of seclusion, to warn chiefs of the five ""families"" that the gang war must stop.Brando is the strong magnet that will draw fans to ""The Godfather."" But behind-the-scenes creativity is of equal value to this film of towering proportions.The immensity of the project must have been staggering, but producer Albert S. Ruddy, director Francis Ford Coppola and screenwriter Mario Puzo, with Coppola, make it seem easy."
4959,False,"We know from Gay Talese's book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn't all sunshine and roses. More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of ""The Godfather,"" which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.AdvertisementThe remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.""The Godfather"" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises."
4960,False,"The son of a Mafia boss returns from the war and following an attempt on his father's life becomes more and more embroiled in the shadowy world of organised crime. Francis Ford Coppola's classic gangster saga is the story of a criminal dynasty headed by Marlon Brando in one of his most iconic roles. Coppola's direction is deceptively simple in that he uses no gimmicks or stylistic tricks; he merely allows the story to unfold and lets the superb cast do their thing. Brando's mumbling family and loyalty obsessed don has since become part of popular culture folklore (along with the classic score) and all other accompanying performances are top notch, from James Caan's hot headed Santino to Robert Duval's purely business orientated adviser. But this film is really the story of Michael's transition from honest war hero to shadowy underworld figure, played by Al Pacino in his finest role. The pivotal scene in which his newborn godson is baptised while Michael himself, the newborn ""Godfather"", is baptised in blood is an all time great. This is the birth of the modern gangster film and with the possible exception of Goodfellas, it is still to be surpassed."
4961,False,"The Godfather (including Part 2 for purpose of this review) is probably the most analysed film of all time, so really I don't see the point in repeating any of the rhetorics. Rather, what I intend to provide here is my honest two cents of this film.The Godfather is not an easy film to watch, so it baffled me at that time of watching for the first time (and still baffles me to this day) how it is so universally loved by almost anyone who has watched it. Firstly, there are so many characters that I gave up remembering anyone other than the Corleone family. Secondly, the script is so subtle and tight that the moment I missed a single sentence, I did not get the next scene. It was no easy feat to follow every sentence given the frequent mutterings, so subtitles are almost indispensable. In the end, I pretty much referred to the plot synopsis every 5 minutes.Make no mistake, the reasons above are also what probably makes the Godfather regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. It just surprises me how a film as subtle as the Godfather has received just as much attention as 'lighter' classics such as Star Wars, Pulp Fiction, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, etc.Ultimately, my verdict is that the Godfather is a great, iconic film from the 70s era, but my honest take is that the Godfather is perhaps a little over-hyped (not overrated, but over-hyped) to the extent that it gets more exposure than some of the other equally great films from the olden era. For that, the Godfather is a great film, but is not in my consideration for the greatest film of all time."
4962,False,"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name. It stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone, focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss.Paramount Pictures obtained the rights to the novel before it gained popularity for the price of $80,000. Studio executives had trouble finding a director, as their first few candidates turned down the position. They and Coppola disagreed over who would play several characters, in particular Vito and Michael. Filming was done on location and completed earlier than scheduled. The musical score was composed primarily by Nino Rota with additional pieces by Carmine Coppola.The film was the highest-grossing film of 1972 and was for a time the highest-grossing film ever made. It won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando) and Best Adapted Screenplay (for Puzo and Coppola). Its seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. It was followed by sequels The Godfather Part II (1974) and Part III (1990).The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema and one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre. It was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990 and is ranked the second-greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute."
4963,False,"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy"
4964,False,"Yeah. I don't think i have to write more than that actually. I think the most of you already know how good this movie is (or how good these movies are), and what the story is. It has so much emotion and is depicting that world so compelling, it's hard to explain it without spoilers. If you like crime movies, watch it. If you like drama, watch it. Do you like suspense and action? Watch it. Do you like music? Watch it. It's the kind of movie that has everything. The kind of movie that leaves you breathless, that you will never forget. The only people who shouldn't watch it is the ones that only like modern movies with lots of cgi and big explosions and action from start to finish."
4965,False,"First of all, it's been a while since I decided to watch The Godfather, but somehow I never have enough will power to do so. I heard people saying it's the greatest movie of all time, but I was still being skeptic about this statement, as I couldn't imagine a movie with such a long play time grabbing your attention all over it. When it started playing I could sense the outstanding feeling of the early 50's USA. It just felt natural to be part of this world, as we were born to it. The plot is not to be detailed, as it's one of the most famous movies, but I can assure everyone, this is the strongest part of the film. Of course there are some action scenes where bad people shoot with guns, there are some romantic scenes where beautiful woman make love with handsome man, but all of these give the essential of the Godfather. We learn the rules of this world, without directly being told each of them. We become the part of the family, and we suffer or win, as the Corleones do. We start to worry about the characters, that feel alive and realistic. Our first, probably negative impression are getting overwrite by the deeper, and more considered emotions, which are more likely to be positive. We understand that some things have to be done, no matter what the moral says. Yes, we can live the live of the Corleones, and that's a thing not every movie can provide. The Godfather is not the best movie of all time, not for me at least. But it surely worth watching, not just because it's a legend, but for why it has become a legend."
4966,False,"After so many years of only knowing of this movie by reputation, I finally watched this in its entirety on a flight from Korean Air. It's such a violent movie and I was very surprised it was even shown on the plane though there was a disclaimer that anyone younger than 18 should only watch with an adult guardian. What did I think of the film, itself? Well, it's fascinating to watch all the scenes leading to certain killings and the male cast members certainly put their heart into the roles though the female cast members don't have as much of a chance to develop their characters as fully as their opposites. But knowing both Diane Keaton and Talia Shire have parts in the two sequels makes me think I'd get the know their characters better later on. I also read on Wikipedia of deleted scenes restored when the three films in the series were put together for TV and DVD/VHS so maybe that may also be an offer I couldn't refuse to watch someday. In summary, The Godfather was a very good film though I stop at considering it one of the greatest of all time...P.S. I was familiar with singer Al Martino way before his role in this film as my parents owned three of his record albums-This is Love, Spanish Eyes, and A Merry Christmas-that I used to listen quite frequently to as a kid during the '70s."
4967,False,"I'll start off by saying, as the title says that this is most certainly one of the best movies I ever watched. The movie is fun to watch, what's most important and it's not just for certain parts of the movie, but the whole movie all the way through from the beginning to the end is interesting and unpredictable. This is something that today's movies lack, and what the movies from the past always had which made them great. Story of the movie if fascinating allowing us to see what the real ""mobster world"", underground world to be precise looked in the 1960's, 1970's as many scenes in the movie show us. All in all this is one hell of a movie and I'd suggested to everyone to watch."
4968,False,"""The Godfather,"" a 1970s film detailing the struggles of a Mafia family in post-World War II New York City, not only changed the face of cinema forever, but also resurrected a genre that had been dead since the Howard Hughes mafia opus ""Scarface"" hit the silver screen in the 1930s.Directed by then-novice Francis Ford Coppola, future mastermind behind ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Tucker,"" and ""Youth Without Youth,"" ""The Godfather"" not only demonstrates poise and expertise in writing and directing but also in acting. Coppola put his career on the line fighting with power- hungry studio executives to get the actors he felt fit the roles. Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone, youngest son of don Vito Corleone, expertly immerses himself in his character, down to the way he walks and talks, carries himself, and even shoots a gun in the famous ""gun behind the toilet"" assassination scene. Marlon Brando as the elder Corleone gives one of the greatest performances in cinematic history. With Robert Duvall as mild-mannered family consigliere Tom Hagen, and James Caan as the hotheaded Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone, every part is well cast and executed to perfection.Not only are the acting, writing, and directing top-notch, but so is the way the film is carried with great setting, music, and a feeling of authenticity. As Michael travels the picturesque hills of 1940s Sicily, ""Speak Softly Love,"" the famous tune by Nino Rota, transports audiences into the beautiful but deadly world of upper-class criminals. Everything in the film is well timed and well placed, offering the audience a portal into a life filled with twists and turns. ""The Godfather"" also reflects the fact that Coppola collaborated well with Mario Puzo, the author of the novel, and Coppola did a plethora of research to ensure the authenticity of his mobsters. The actors talk, eat, sleep, and kill like real-world criminals, embodying the swagger of high-rolling Italian mobsters. The dialogue flows from their lips as if Al Capone or Jon Gotti said it. ""The Godfather"" will go down in history as one of the most well made films of all time."
4969,False,"I have dissected this film, piece by piece. This is a film that can be seen several times, and each time, you take something else from the film. It's incredibly difficult to digest all of the beautiful layers that make The Godfather so special. There are thousands of films out there that are cut-n-dry. Basically, what u see is what u get....no less, no more. While, if u don't have an understanding of organized crime and its origin, u will most likely overlook the remarkable accuracy of the film. The life that is portrayed in The Godfather was very real, for many many years. However, as yrs went by, organized crime families, in America, began slowly straying from their core values...i.e., family, ""Omerta"" (code of silence), secrecy, respect, loyalty, etc. The Godfather illustrates life in the mafia during the 1st half of the 20th Century, where as a film like Goodfellas, shows mafia life during the 2nd half of the 20th Century. The Godfather is a film loaded w legendary actors who perform a script that's full of substance & grace, both, written & directed, by the great Francis Ford Coppola. Movies like, The Godfather, come around only a handful of times during a lifetime. Cinematic masterpiece."
4970,False,"What can I say about The Godfather that hasn't already been said? The 1972 film is widely regarded as the best film of all time. Everybody has heard of it and even if they haven't seen it, they can instantly recognize it. Although the way that nobody in The Godfather swears like a real gangster does bother me quite a bit, this is still one of the best mafia movies in the world and definitely the best fiction crime film. The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): ""Don't ever take sides against the family.From the opening of The Godfather we know right away who Vito Corleone is. We know what kind of man he is and we know what he stands for. Despite being a gangster, the audience always thinks of him as a good man. He does not let any harm come to anyone who is not in ""the business"". He does not like to use violence unless it is really needed and says time and time again that family always comes first. And the way Marlon Brando's amazing performance portrays this is nothing but exceptional.Al Pacino's role as Michael Corleone was perfectly cast and launched Al Pacino's career and made him the man that we all know today.The Godfather has terrific energy, you get sucked into the world of The Godfather and you are a part of what is going on and that is what makes the viewing experience of The Godfather so amazing."
4971,False,"Francis Ford Coppola manages to execute one of the finest pieces of American cinema with the first of his three part saga, The Godfather. From the dialogue to the acting, this film excels in painting a gritty, realistic depiction of the mobster hierarchy, with one of the greatest pieces of acting in cinematic history with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone. This film has already stood the test of time and is deservedly ranked as one of the greatest films of all time. A true masterpiece.I urge you if you have not yet checked out this film, what are you waiting for? It's a true hallmark of cinematic excellence and is undoubtedly one of the greatest films ever made, in my opinion."
4972,False,"It is sort of disheartening to read the plethora of negative reviews of this film on IMDb. There seems to be a fundamental gap between those who understand and appreciate the history and the evolution of cinema and those whose powers of perception and attention spans have been impaired by mind-numbing video games and by a culture of total immersion in the utter banality of ""social media."" I even read one negative review which seriously attempted to draw a comparison between ""The Godfather"" and the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. I loved both movies by the way, but FOR CHRISSAKES! It's apples and oranges! One of those movies was a thoughtful, introspective ADULT film, which are few and far between. The other film, though great entertainment, was not.The acting (across the board), the script (almost entirely Coppola's) and directing (entirely Coppola's) in the ""The Godfather,"" though arguably equaled on occasion, have never been bested by any Hollywood or independent film. One qualification here: to the amazement of every film critic and everyone else alive in the 20th Century, the movie ""The Godfather"" was actually eclipsed by ""The Godfather, Part II,"" which really needs to be seen back-to-back with ""The Godfather"" in order to fully appreciate either film. The two films in combination are really just the 1st and 2nd halves of Mario Puzo's pulp fiction book, entitled ""The Godfather."" Coppola's screenplay elevated Puzo's 2nd-rate prose immeasurably, and together those two films constitute the single greatest piece of epic-scale movie-making in the history of American cinema."
4973,False,"We know from Gay Talese's book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn't all sunshine and roses. More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of ""The Godfather,"" which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.""The Godfather"" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.But Brando's performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whispery, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although ""The Godfather"" is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn't time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he'll have to cancel his day at the races).The success of ""The Godfather"" as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garrotings.Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so ""The Godfather"" becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they'd tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn't have worked. But it's uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish-brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other."
4974,False,"The Godfather is an absolute ""Classic"". Both Al Pacino and Robert DeNero killed their roles. It's not often we get a movie with such in-depth detail as to why things happened the way they did. Politically correct in every ""bad"" way. I was very young when i first seen this movie and really didn't grasp the exact concept. Now, as an adult, it all makes sense. If anyone reading this has never seen this movie, I recommend you watch it and the others as well. It might even touch home with most that grew up in these neighborhoods and countries during the date allocated within the film. Film makers and anyone acting should make it an occupation to watch this film. Exciting, passionate, dramatic. These are the words I use to best describe my experience with watching this movie. It has also sparked my interest in making my own films. The action and originality of the film makes me want to create a movie just like this one in modern day times. Thank you Godfather, for you have given me much needed inspiration."
4975,False,"Hailed as the best movie ever by most people, and I tend to agree. We probably won't see a movie this perfect in quite some time. Everything from the casting to the execution of the finished film is handled with such precision it is truly astounding.I guess you are wonder why I wrote ""probably"" in the summary and well, let me tell you this: There is another movie that is if not better at least on the same level as this one. And the movies name? It ends with II.That Francis Ford Coppola was capable to pull this of at such a young age is awe inspiring and even more so when he did it a second time around. I mean how many movies have a sequel/prequel that is if not as good even better than the first one? Don't worry, you can count I will be right here waiting for you to finish. What did you find? Terminator 2, Lord of the rings 3, Toy Story 3, The Bourne trilogy and The Dark Knight? Well you would be correct and this shows you have rare it is when you think about how many sequels there are."
4976,False,"Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business.The Godfather, which opened at five theaters here yesterday, is a superb Hollywood movie that was photographed mostly in New York (with locations in Las Vegas, Sicily, and Hollywood). It's the gangster melodrama come of age, truly sorrowful and truly exciting, without the false piety of the films that flourished forty years ago, scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesn't (or, at least, shouldn't) pay.It still doesn't, but the punishments suffered by the members of the Corleone Family aren't limited to sudden ambushes on street corners or to the more elaborately choreographed assassinations on thruways. They also include lifelong sentences of ostracism in terrible, bourgeois confinement, of money and power, but of not much more glory than can be obtained by the ability to purchase expensive bedroom suites, the kind that include everything from the rug on the floor to the pictures on the wall with, perhaps, a horrible satin bedspread thrown in."
4977,False,"The Godfather is a timeless classic. Everything about it is just masterful from the performances to the direction to the wonderful soundtrack. Marlon Brando effortlessly portrayed the cool calm composure of Vito Corleone, whilst Al Pacino was great as Michael Corleone. His transformation from family outsider to ruthless mob boss was believable and realistic. The Godfather also felt authentic from the sets to the costumes. One thing that also surprised me was how despite the Godfather being a three hour film, it is paced very well. I never felt confused or bored whilst watching it. It is an amazing film.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/ToQuF3"
4978,False,"If you think again, you will realize that writing a review about The Godfather is quite stupid! This is a movie, every person in this world should have seen before death! I cannot understand people who do not like this movie!It is suspenseful, partly shocking, political, love story and much more... Simply the best movie of all timeIf there is someone who reads this review and hasn't watched The Godfather... WATCH THIS ONE and you will agree that there is no movie that is better! Believe me! Watch The Godfather!NOW!!!"
4979,False,"The Godfather is one of the rare movie which makes us sympathize the evil. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) gives out the steam of a real mafia Don. The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): ""Don't ever take sides against the family."" Like Babe Ruth is to baseball, like John Steinbeck is to writing, their is no doubt about it, The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. Never before have we seen performances so stellar, by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and everyone else! The Godfather has little life lessons everywhere. Along with an engaging plot, that just completes the most critically acclaimed film of all time. The Godfather is Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece."

4981,False,"Marlon Brando's old flame that has glowed for years, and flickered along a trail bumpy with mediocre pictures, shines higher and brighter than ever. The old irresistible magic is revived in Paramount's ""The Godfather"" in his intuitive grasp of Mario Puzo's Don Corleone, a living symbol of the poetic translation of his name, the lionhearted.Brando is cool as the godfather, sagacious head of the Corleone ""family,"" most powerful of the five ""families"" of organized crime in New York. He is relaxed as the loving, indulgent patriarch of his large blood family, in his mansion behind an iron fence in Long Beach, L.I. And he is terrifically appealing as the man who cheats death, recovers from bullet wounds inflicted by a rival gang, recuperates at home to enjoy his garden and grandchildren until he dies of old age. Once he comes out of seclusion, to warn chiefs of the five ""families"" that the gang war must stop.Brando is the strong magnet that will draw fans to ""The Godfather."" But behind-the-scenes creativity is of equal value to this film of towering proportions.The immensity of the project must have been staggering, but producer Albert S. Ruddy, director Francis Ford Coppola and screenwriter Mario Puzo, with Coppola, make it seem easy."
4982,False,"This film really opened my eyes to the drama of beautiful cinematography and how compelling you can make an image simply with the framing. Having each shot tell its own story is an incredible element towards crafting an excellent film. In addition to the cinematography, I became a huge fan of Brando because of this film. I read that he used some personal techniques to craft his character and I really admire that now that I am looking for ways to make my own screen-time unique and dynamic. I wish films would continue to use The Godfather as a model for good cinema. There is something missing from modern movie-making that can be rediscovered by watching films like this."
4983,False,"Prometheus, gave fire to humanity, a cherished and imperative gift for a foolish civilization that much needed it. Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo also gave a gift to humanity, a gift that should be the object of study of film students, an epic and dramatic visual tale for film lovers, and an incentive to appreciate cinema in its brightest and purest form for those who are willing to forget their lives for a little under 3 hours.The Godfather never gets old, and I believe it never will. It has withstood the test of time and never truly feels like a film of over 40 years of history. At times, this masterpiece begins to resemble fine wine, seemingly acquiring a better taste as it ages on.Its dialogue profoundly feels like discourse directly taken from the streets of New York at the beginning of the century. The cinematography and the acting feel exceptionally natural, and along with a cohesive and coherent pacing, these components make the flow of the film feel like a river in its calmest days: smooth, beautiful and noble. Every shot in the film faithfully serves a greater purpose; every shot feels like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle that never breaks apart.The ambition of the storytelling surpasses, I believe, its own expectations. It provides a sense of wonder, of fascination, nothing short of admiration. Despite having seen the film for over easily 30 times, every time I place my eyes and ears over that glorious opening scene, I can't help but feel like a child going to the beach for the first time, or a teenager going on a road trip; I feel a roller-coaster under my seat in its peak, waiting slowly to descend into the sublime. Very few stories can relate in terms of value.The characterization manifests itself over the course of a film in brilliant ways, exploiting the strengths and weaknesses of every one of its characters superbly. Even the minor characters have moments of spectacle. The motivations of each character come to life in outstanding takes, and not one of them ever truly feels expendable.The Godfather is a colossus, perhaps the summit of filmmaking. It is something every individual can appreciate, from its little details to its grand climax. It is something to be remembered for generations to come. It is something that will likely be unmatched for a great many years."
4984,False,"A must watch for every movie buff and specially for Fans of Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. The story shows how a man balances his work and family so well keeping in mind that his business is full of threat. Character of Vito Corleone defines what a real man is like and on the other hand Character of Michael Corleone shows how to contain anger and utilize it in most lethal way possible. This Story also shows how the mafia families have ruled the cities with both good and bad to their characters.The early life and career of Vito Corleone in 1920s New York is portrayed while his son, Michael, expands and tightens his grip on his crime syndicate stretching from Lake Tahoe, Nevada to pre-revolution 1958 Cuba. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen."

If you are looking for ideas to prank or get revenge this film is worth watching.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part- III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them."
4986,False,"This film is truly epic, develops the characters in an amazing way, especially to Don Corleone, that he does in the film as a superior to all, with more knowledge and intelligence, based on their sense of friendship and favors. I love this kind of movies in which the protagonists or antagonists are complex beings, with ambitious and colossal ideas, and that not anyone could do. The conclusions of every act and decision that Don Corleone, or of his son, are amazing, doing all to the big, I consider at all of one of the best movies that I see in all my life, and I will never forgot the sound-track and the landscape, that is the final complement that does the movie unforgettable."
4987,False,"You want story? You got it. You want characters? You got it. You want intrigue and movement and music and gala? You got it. This is the template for how movies should be made. You love/hate the people. You feel their lives. You believe and cast aside doubt. You get wrapped up in the thing. This is what a movie is supposed to do.It's more than a mafia movie, it's a movie about family and loyalty, about love and determination. There is no comic relief, except Luca testing his devotion to the Don, and then tragedy. Yes, a very tragic movie but very well done. There are triumphs. There are falls. All very well mixed and very well done. Excellent work done on the costume and general set work. It draws you into the time and place, as a good movie should. No cheap shots, no pandering. Just very good cinema. Bravo."
4988,False,"Every character seems to be perfectly embedded, everyone has a specified reason to be in the plot and each one brings something substantial that makes us remember them.

Beyond a classification for the characters, you gonna love them as they are, and we can understand that there's more than just black and white. Definitely, a movie to watch, no matter how many years from his release, and no, I can't say that is a gangster movie, neither that is a Pacino's Movie, no no, It's more than that, The Godfather could be called for to many people like ""The Movie""."

There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other."
4991,False,"This movie is excellent! Probably the best I've ever seen the props are very good minding the year it was released and the acting is out of this world. I've read the book before and after watching the movie and I tell you the second time was much better! It was like the pictures the book tried to create came out alive as I've seen the in the movie and it was really cool. They did put a lot of effort to this movie and it does pay off, as the scenery and the costumes and everything is so detailed. Of course the atmosphere of the movie is marvelous and really travels you back to the 40s spot on! You should totally see this movie, or better watch the whole trilogy. It is must!"
4992,False,"OSM movie all time biggest movie of mine. I think no movie can be compared to this one.I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him."
4993,False,"This Film is one of my favorite films of all times. I think that Coppola take a big risk after THX and Zootrope. This is a profound story about human nature trying to balance between the human desire of power the love of family. Every time I have the opportunity of see this film, I try to figure out how Francis resolve anything in the way to make a complete piece about the family issues, but in the same time a great portrait of the Italian mafia that today it's the ambiance and pace formula for the mafia films and also in Mexico the formula for the Mexican cartels. Also the great decision to invite a Al Pacino for the main role it's an excellent direction just below of the Brandon's performance."
4994,False,"progression of the movie follows the development of the following linear, logical sequenced story lines ¬ñ Don Corleone is shot; Michael seeks retaliation by shooting Sollozzo and McClusky; The mafia family wars begin with a parallel story of Michael taking refuge in Italy; Don Corleone holds a peace summit between the families; Michael returns to America and becomes the new family Don upon his father's death. This is a standard ""cause and effect"" progression with each scene logically leading to the next having characters with differing goals clashing, and obtaining help from other characters to resolve conflicts and meet their ultimate goals. As a result, the characters' individual actions as well as group interaction help move the movie along."
4995,False,"Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi- generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. One of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes, The Godfather gets everything right; not only did the movie transcend expectations, it established new benchmarks for American cinema. Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. The film can be viewed on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who demand much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but it is one-hundred seventy minutes well-spent. When the closing credits roll, only a portion of the story has been told."
4996,False,"It's a great film in the history of film. Such a well sculpted film- making. Must watch to experience the true art of film. What I loved about it was the story telling, not exaggerating the crimes, taking the tones seriously and the artful cinematography. Marlon Brando again defined acting and the range of acting. Al Pacino became a star through this film for his extravagant and powerful performance. The production was so neat, the timing of the dialogue. It lives up to the expectation of Mario Puzo's novel. Some of the scenes were so real and eye-opening. It really explores thorough the darkness of human behavior. This is a ""MUST SEE"" movie don't miss it."
4997,False,"I just want to say that is the fantastic movie. If you wonder the old New York and mafias you're not going to be regret for watching this film. In the movie they're summarizing Italian's Life in 30's. Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap- operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10."
4998,False,"The year was 1972. Francis Ford Coppola was in the beginning of this career, and he was only in the process of proving himself as a director. Little did he know, that he was going to direct a movie which would go down as possibly THE most beloved and acclaimed film of all time. The movie was ""The Godfather"". It became the highest grossing film of the year 1972, and of all time (in 1972)! It won 3 Oscars: Best Actor (Marlon Brando), Best Adapted Screenplay (Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola) and Best Picture (Albert S. Ruddy). Unfortunately, Coppola did not take home the gold for directing, nor did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall or James Caan for their brilliant supporting roles! But Oscars really doesn't matter, the movie still stands as a piece of cinematic brilliance! The Godfather tells a relatively simple tale: Michael Corleone (Pacino) is son of the powerful mafia don Vito Corleone (Brando). Michael recently returned from the WW2, and he wants nothing to do with the ""family business"". Vito doesn't want that either, but after a chain of events, Michael is forced to rise as the new family don, in order to protect his family and allies from downfall. The movie doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. It's a simple plot, it's one we can all understand and it's still en epic gangster movie! And that's the other thing about the film: it's very epic in scope! All the locations, all the props, all the actors, etc. It all comes together to create something magical! Al Pacino keys in an amazing performance as Michael, the son who must protect his family! At first eye-drop one could call his performance ""low-key"". But it's merely an observation of the characters calmness, subtlety and his cold nature, that transforms into a calculating, ruthless and chilling persona. Apparently, Pacino approached the role with this thought. For my money, this was an Academy Award-worthy performance. Marlon Brando is equally impressing as Vito Corelone. His performance is calm, determined and calculated. But Brando doesn't only present Vito Corleone as a clich√© ruthless mafioso don, but also as a father that loves his family, and that the audience can admire and care for. Robert Duvall, James Caan, Talia Shire, John Gazale and Diane Keaton is also presented as capable and great characters! Everyone gets tons of character development, and their performances are spectacular!Nino Rota's haunting score perfectly illustrates what kind of film we're dealing with here, and every time you hear it the score feels new and epic! This has got to be one of the most memorable film scores of all time! The cinematography is beautiful, the sound is fantastic and overall The Godfather is a truly beautiful film to admire! Puzo and Coppola's screenplay is brilliant and filled with memorable lines: ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"", ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli"" and ""It's not personal Sonny, it's strictly business"". Francis Ford Coppola truly captures the feeling of a spaghetti gangster movie, and his direction is brilliant, tireless and visible in every scene! Twentieth Century Fox wanted to replace him several times during production, but thankfully they didn't! He was robbed an Oscar!The Godfather is a movie that will never grow old, and we will be able to watch if for many years to come! It always feels fresh and exiting every time you watch it! From the first monologue by Bonasera, to the last shot of Michael Corleone as the new don, this movie leaves you shattered by the perfection. Saying The Godfather is a perfect movie, is like saying Chuck Norris is badass. See my point? A must-watch for everyone! 10/10"
4999,False,"This is considered my favorite movie and to many others, no wonder why The Godfather was considered to be the Perfect movie, cause of Frances Ford Coppola's Unquestionable direction and the film's story of the family business and a human story as well! This is the holy grail of gangster films that is to me and everyone, a real unforgettable classic! Excellent movie, quality acting, screenplay,depth of characters, locations! Producer,director,music,all excellent. It will be a long time before this movie is exceeded in all these facets. Current films do not come close in matching Francis Ford Cappola's masterpiece. Mr.Cappola's refusal make another film only reflects great decision making in the industry. Many film makers in the future should emulate the overall quality shown in ""The Godfather""."
5000,False,"How does one begin to describe a film like The Godfather? Many call it a ""masterpiece,"" and I disagree with them. A masterpiece implies perfection and, in my opinion, no film will ever achieve perfection. But The Godfather comes pretty damn close.Most already know the story of The Godfather. It's a narrative that's complex, yet simple and it's story that's fluid and interesting. It's complicated, but the story is told with such ease, it's like watching a master artist at work. The Godfather is superb storytelling at its finest.The story's fluidity has very much to do with the characters. The men of the Corleone family are all distinct and interesting, due to the stellar performances. Of course, the standout here is Marlon Brando as Vito, the aging Patriarch of this crime family. He's simply magnificent whenever he's on screen. That's not to discount the other great performances from the rest of the cast, which includes Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert DuvallThe film is technically brilliant as well. The cinematography is stunning, with the more bright colors jumping off the screen, while the blacks set the mood well for darker story moments. The sound is more subtle in its accomplishments, but when you hear the chatter of machine guns, it makes your heart skip a beat.It's hard to pick my absolute favorite film of all time. I could easily say Lawrence of Arabia, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, or Lord of the Rings. And I could also easily say The Godfather, as most others have done. But I don't like making such conclusive statements. But don't worry, Godfather. It's not personal. It's strictly business."
5001,False,"This American motion picture classic provides the ideal learning tool for anyone who is interested in the organized crime-genre of film and the foundations for any aspiring actor, director, producer, composer and writer who decides to take the steps to becoming a cinematic legend.The simple, yet strangely complex plot derives from the Corleone dynasty as they face the repercussions of their criminal activity since the 1920s. The storyline, centers on Vito Corleone's (portrayed by two-time Academy-Award winner Marlon Brando) renunciation as the patriarchal figurehead of one of the ""Big Five"" organized crime families of the day and the ascension of his reluctant son Michael (Al Pacino) as his successor.Regarded as one of greatest films in world cinema, The Godfather reveals a chilling insight into the world of underground mafia led by this Italian-American empire by the ever-so intimidating presence of Brando as he appears on screen. Brando's transfixed facial expression and unnerving speech captures the stereotypical mafia leader with ease and is truly the focal point of the picture ¬ñ with Pacino's performance a close second.The premise of this picture is clear - family loyalty ¬ñ regardless of whether your next of kin is in the right or not. Something, which Connie and Michael Corleone fail to recognize as essential for desiring acceptance into the 'business'. That is, for Michael, until his father's health is jeopardized as a result of his foes seeking vengeance and instigates Michael's sudden change of heart.The incessant drawing of how accurate Coppola represents the typical American-infused Sicilian mafia family truly draws one's eyes until the credits come rolling in. A definite ""thumps up"" for anyone interested in movies and a thought-provoking mind. One of the best films I have seen in my entire life and it will leave you scrambling to find and watch the sequels that follow!"
5002,False,"Due to the restrictions of the 10 point voting system I have been forced to settle on a 9/10 rating, however I prefer a more accurate score, and that would be 8.9 stars.The movie is an undoubtable classic. I've noticed on here there are a lot of 1 star reviews, all of which are rather ignorant and at times rather obnoxious. It's understandable if it doesn't live up to your expectations, but I don't even think this movie should have the option of a star rating below 5 because anyone who gives it lower rating should not really be reviewing movies. I admit that I was very against the idea of this film, the idea that it was so popular but would really live up to the standards set by so many sycophantic fans seemed almost impossible to me. Having already been disappointed by the movie ""Avatar"" (not visually of course, but for the predictable and, at times, tiresome plot). The Godfather, on the other hand, has a much more unpredictable storyline, yet nothing that happens is a huge shock. At times seemingly arbitrary events eventually collate into a cohesive part of the movie. Despite pushing the 3 hour mark, you are constantly entertained, and hanging on to every word, almost every action holds some importance and the feeling that something is about to happen is constant and justified.I don't want to reveal too much about the movie so I shall attempt to keep the review vague in places, and will stop in regards to the storyline now. Even if the storyline fails to inspire, at the very least, some sort of appreciation, there are five words that command respect: ""Al Pacino and Marlon Brando."" They give the film a level of cool, control and power that affects the viewer in many ways, and maybe even re-establishes the idea of acting. Powerful emotions, casually being used with an air on nonchalance and grace, emotions that are usually over-played, and over-acted in other movies in which actors flaunt their talents carelessly. In this film we get a masterclass in acting from two masters of the screen. The acting from every character is pitched perfectly, every character balances each other out, and their personalities are contrastingly complimentary towards each other. I have a lot of good to say about this movie, so now I should explain why i gave it a ""mere"" 8.9. Firstly I must admit I don't believe in the idea that there is such thing as a ""perfect"" movie, so I am viewed as a somewhat ""harsh marker,"" and thus it would never get a full 10.0, but there are some aspects of this film that I believe to be either superfluous or under-developed. Basically put, there are bits that could maybe be replaced by some extra character or storyline developments. This, however, is just a personal issue, and I would stress that 8.9 is the second highest rating I have ever given, and to be honest, my mind is constantly changing on that score, and I may actually, in the future, wish to raise it. On a final note, I will just say that this truly is one of the greatest films ever made, and I would urge anyone reading this to watch the film. If you don't like it that is a shame, but if you do (which you probably will), it will be a film you will carry with you for the rest of your life."
5003,False,"The movie ""The Godfather"" is an awesome movie! Some things that inspired me to watch the whole series was: tension, characters, and the love. All of these thing brought the movie to life. It was the most dramatic thing ever; however it was sad. When Michael says ""Ah, that little farce you played with my sister. You think that would fool a Corleone?"" The director did the lines terrifically well. This line capturing to me. This would be the most exciting movie that I've ever seen! I'm so glad my family recommended it to me. At first I thought that the movie would be horrible, but then I realized that the tension was to much that I had to keep watching it. It was the kind of movie that when it ended you wanted to see the next one just to know what would happen. A few times I cried, but don't all movies have a crying point in them. It was just to much action, tension, and feeling in the movie for me to stop watching. The character Al Pancio was my favorite because he has so much energy in his role plays. Some other movies that he played in was: ""ScarFace"", ""Heat"", and of course ""The Godfather"". All of these were his best yet. Al Pancio is the most vibrant actor that I have ever seen, that would probably be why I love his acting so much. Furthermore, another actor would be Richard S. Castellano. Additionally, this man was the one who taught Al Pancio how to shoot the crooked cop in the movie, and the shocking thing was that he used to be a construction manager. One woman, named Talia Shire, also played a role. She has stared not only in ""The Godfather"", but in ""Rocky"". She is also the stepmother of the Schwartzman family. All these actors/actress were magnificent during the movie, they played their part so well. The sad thing about the movie would be the death. Moreover, the death was gruesome. It had so much detail that you can't seem to watch; however, you sometimes just can't turn away. Although if given a chance it will come to the point that it's awesome. This stage point of the death will soon rube off in less you hate the fact of blood (lots of blood and cursing). All I'm saying is give it a chance. The love that the character give to each other is so affectionate, even off scene there still friends. It's like as though there one big family meeting for a family reunion. Even in the movie they gradually connect. For example, Al Panico and Richard S. Castellano. They were like father and son when they were together, and in the movie they were still like family except at the same time enemies. The movie, when seen, will have the same effect on you once you notice how well they act together. The film went on for $80,000 because Paramount bought in before the book became a best-seller. A previous gangster film bombed at the box office, the company was reluctant to even make the movie, and initially budgeted only $2 million to $3 million. That's a fact. Over all, the movie is great to watch. Its tension will follow you until you've seen the whole series. ""The Godfather"" is one of the most never before seen movies with life in it. With what the movie has you will not no what was just watched. The movie is epic and will always be remembered as the most amazing movie ever."
5004,False,"The greatest film ever said by many. First film of the greatest trilogy ever said by many. I agree with second one, but not the first one. This is the greatest trilogy. And the first film is the pearl of that package. I drew my expectations extremely high before watching this classic. Unfortunately I had to fall. I didn't get the grain, that cutting-edge I was looking for. Fortunately the fall wasn't that high. I still liked the movie a lot. It was a great picture. A massive film in its genre. I like good mafia films. But I don't fancy them that much. But like I said, in its own genre this picture is a front runner.The cast is the strongest part of the movie. Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) as The Godfather is like a fist to the eyehole. He is just so boss. At the same time he is so wise and calm. Robert Duvall, Al Pacino and others give a very good contribution, but it is Marlon Brando who shines throughout the movie. The line 'the man who does not spend time with his family, is not a man' is epic.There are lots of classic music in this movie. Some parts of the movie are in Italian. This is not your regular Hollywood movie. This is not that entertaining but still after seeing this, you'll probably say 'wow'."
5005,False,"The Godfather is, in a nutshell, a terrific movie.The cast is brilliant, from Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) to Diane Keaton (Kay Adams); each one of them suits their role perfectly.Marlon Brando is without a doubt, one of the best actors to ever set foot on this earth. His astonishing portrayal of Vito makes me sad that he's not going to appear in the sequels.Al Pacino also plays a beautiful role, one of Vito's sons who later takes on the family business. Notice how he transforms himself from this calm war-hero to a hard-ass Don. Not a lot of people can do that.I love how the movie - most of it at least - takes place in New York while most of the characters are Italian. But that only spices the movie up. The story is unique and smartly written, and it suits me since I like the time that it took place in.So if you're a fan of the post-WWII age, then I strongly urge you to get this movie. Hell, even if you're not, it would be a shame if you don't watch it."
5006,False,"Because this movie has Extraordinary performances, amazing direction, incredible screenplay, and an excellent soundtrack, it's more than good, more than great, it's perfection in every way. When I first saw this movie, I was 10 years old, and I couldn't stand it, and now I love it, so be patient, watch this movie and observe every detail, that will make it unforgettable.Vito Corleone(Brando) is the aging don (head) of the Corleone Mafia Family. His youngest son Michael(Pacino) has returned from WWII just in time to see the wedding of Connie Corleone (Tania Shire, Michael's sister) to Carlo Rizzi(Russo). All of Michael's family is involved with the Mafia, but Michael just wants to live a normal life. Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo(Lettieri) is looking for Mafia Families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don's lawyer Tom Hagen(Duvall), the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart.Everybody says that the movie gets everything right, and it's true. This movie follows a narrative rhythm that is impeccable, it never slows down too much, and that's because the whole movie is slow. And in some tense scenes (Like the scene where Michael is changing his father's room in the hospital), and even some funny ones (When Michael is in Sicily talking to a man about that girl that he met, and the guy finds out that she's his daughter), it's done with excellency.The screenplay is one of the best ever made. It develops it's character so well, that almost everyone is learning something during the story. And of course, it gives us memorable quotes like the classic ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse!"" or ""I'm a superstitious man!"". The Soundtrack by Nino Rota is brilliant, and you can notice that right in the first scene.The acting is equally impressing, even Pacino that don't usually blows my mind like everyone says (Not that he is a bad actor, he's excellent, but I prefer contained and calm performances), impressed me a lot, he's so cold and looks so smart that make his turns believable and intelligent. Brando gives one the best performances the world has ever seen, and considering that he was 48 when this movie was released, he convinced me that he was a sick, old man (Which Pacino didn't do that well in ""The Godfather: Part III""). And observe the scene where Hagen tells him about Sonny, and you'll see what I mean by saying that it's one of the best of all time.Verdict: A lot of people, including me, say that it's the best movie ever made, so they probably have a good reason to say that."
5007,False,"MOVIE MAKING AT ITS BEST Excellent in every aspect.... great story, great movie making and very best performances by all the actors. Truly the Best Film Ever. Every actor suited and performed best for his/her part. Marlon was awesome. Story line is very strong and compelling. Cheers to Francis F. C. and Mario Puzo for such a fantastic screenplay. Movie Making is at its best. All 3 movies in the trilogy are good. First Part was the best, second at second place and third at third. Story, making and the acting performances make this movie the best. This movie gave me a whole new perspective to Hollywood and made me realize what Hollywood's magic is. It should be voted number 1. Please vote for this film to make it number 1 of all times. God Bless."
5008,False,"9.8Everybody has heard of The Godfather. You may agree that everybody has seen The Godfather. You might say that everybody loves The Godfather. However, I disagree. It's been 38 years since The Godfather was released in theaters. Although everybody has heard of it, and holds it in high regards, I think that the reason why people enjoy the film is not because of its artistic merits, but its themes and pop culture phenomenon. I also believe that this type of film-making has been lost. Every component of the film holds together well. Each individual aspect of it is finely tuned, and it is seamed together to as close to perfection as the medium allows, as far as we know it. However, it is not the sum of its parts that makes film or art, whatever medium it may be, great. It is not a group full of musicians that makes a record great. It is not great technical and artistic style that makes a painting great. It is not great dialogue, coupled with a good story that makes a novel great. I believe that when these components of an artistic medium are in harmony, it helps to allow for art to form. The Godfather has all of these components in spades and also becomes art.The post WWII atmosphere, set in the midst of Italian crime organizations is engraved into the film. The colors are brown, gold and black, perfectly matching the antique tone. The acting is exceptional, with some performances by young actors that acted as a stepping stone for their careers. The music, while used sparingly, comes in and out at just the right times, and matches the mood of the film well.The camera angles, cinematography and editing are why I used the term near- perfect. There are certain scenes in this film that are simply the best in all of film-making. One of the final scenes, interlaced with a baptism, is an amazing example of using the medium of film-making and its techniques such as editing and directing to inspire emotion and create art. Another scene, which simply just involves one person against a black background, and a single light source above them, is in my opinion one of the best shots of all time, not just in film-making, but photography as well. The Godfather's greatest feat is not that it is a cultural phenomenon. It is, by all definitions, art. You might call expression and aesthetic values by themselves art, but ultimately it is pieces like The Godfather that inspires artists. There is a reason as to why half of this review is talking about art and not The Godfather. The film deserves to be seen, regardless of what you all ready know or what you think you might know about it. Regardless of its theme and setting, the work that the men and women did during the production of this film and its final form deserve to be recognized. This style of film-making is far and few between nowadays, and if you enjoy cinema, you owe it to yourself to experience Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather."
5009,False,"When the Godfather was released in 1972, the golden age of Hollywood was long over. Regardless, this film managed to recall that era while at the same time taking advantage of the ever changing times. This film is darker and more grittier than the films of the thirties and forties as such melancholy was starting to become more common in movies. It definitely didn't forget its roots however. The popular film noir style is very evident in this film: not just in the lighting but in the dark subject matter and often bleak themes. And the themes of the movie are indeed bleak. In fact, as people are shot, blown up, and have revenge acted upon them, an inexperienced movie viewer might wonder what the point is. The point is, under the violence and hate, there is a wealth of good: total justification for the mayhem. The Mafia may be murderous and revengeful, but they have values, possibly even more values than normal, law biding citizens.Marlon Brando gives a breathtaking performance as Don Vito Corleone, a man who is vicious and harden, yet you learn to care for the guy and his family enough so that you eventually root for them every time they get their own way. Al Pacino also gives a great performance as Vito's son Michael, who is different from Vito in many ways. As we learn early on, he could care less about his family's business yet we know he will most likely be shoved into it eventually. We will then learn if he is able to control his family or if he will develop a lust for power and revenge that will cause him to fail altogether. Questions like this are what keep the film interesting and moving forward.The well orchestrated characters also help the plot along and at no point do they seem unrealistic: even when they make drastic choices. And this is important since this is a very character driven film. And that's just one of the many strengths seen here. All great films have multiple strengths and this movie is no exception. Many crime films were made before this film as well as after it. The ones that came before were sometimes weighed down with Hollywood glamor while the ones that came after it were often all flash with no substance: relentlessly violent with no reward in the end for the viewer. The Godfather dodges those weaknesses and it also avoids being pretentious and overblown. Just one of the many things that make The Godfather the best movie of the seventies and possibly the best of all time."
5010,False,"Being a youth (but I would safely consider myself now as an adult), I never get into much witnessing adult stories. I now realize that most of them are undoubtedly beautiful stories. Haven't read yet prior to the film Mario Puzo's novel, I pulled my guts to watch the film and did my best to understand the story as much as I do with other good-storied films. Godfather 1 had indeed made me witness another beautiful story of different origin. I never imagined how many beautiful stories would still be lingering out there, of every nature, of any environment or of any country it originates. Watching the film, starts with Marlon Brando playing the role of Don Vito Corleone, known as well as the ""Godfather"". I didn't quite understand really the way how crime worlds work, but to me I get the opportunity to understand dealing business with wits and cunning as how you deal practically with your teacher in school. The situation is different, but manner of dealing them is nonetheless similar. I appreciated well the film for Italian's value of family, relationship and trust. How Don Vito Corleone manage to deal business mixing trust and respect differently. How he mends and considers things equally and with weight. This is the first time I observed for the first time Al Pacino grasping a character filled with composure and serenity, and maintained such equanimity after tides turned inevitable to him in the story. I had to admit it is one of the excellent films I've watch so far. The characters, the setting, the environment, the story itself is so genuine and good that you couldn't deny it as a considerably first-rate film."
5011,False,"i hated it. the movie was so long and it was hard to follow. the sequels were OK. i feel that this movie was over rated way too much. so it had a good year in the seventies but come on how can this boring movie stand for 3 decades i just don't understand how that is possible. Marlon Brando has had much better roles in on the waterfront, A streetcar named desire, and don Juan Marco just to name a few. Pacino wasn't even that good. i much preferred him in Carlitos way and Donnie bras-co and who could forget Scarface. Pacino is getting typecast. i think the only reason he did Simone was to get away from the typecasting as a mobster or criminal. i have to say i can't blame him. Pacino is also getting typecast as a cop i mean insomnia come on"
5012,False,"I would like to tell everyone that this movie is highly overated expecially considering it is the number one movie in the IMDB TOP 250 LIST!!  Dont get me wrong i like like Francis Ford Coppola's movies but i have never been a fan of this series!!  He definatly has an all star line up , but come on people Marlon Brando cannot act his way out of a paper bag!! Just like one of my favorite Coppola movies ""Apocalypse Now"" Marlon got top billing over Martin Sheen when right well Martin should have been the oscar nominee!! It is a good trilogy but let me tell you something? If you want a good down to earth mob movie see anything done by Martin Scorsese! I wasnt really over touched by this series but i know it has alot of fans!! See ya folks!!!"
5013,False,"""The Godfather"" was a sickening experience the first time I saw it in its initial release, and it hasn't changed.  I thoroughly disliked the film's spirit, finding it very ugly at its heart. I saw little justification for its existence, was sorry I saw it, and have tried to forget it."
5014,False,"A 9.1 on IMDb? cat-scans please .I've never seen a worse depiction of Italians in my life. More like caricatures and stereotyping Italians from the turn of the century as smug talking idiots with Im gonna bust you upside yer f** head as the main dialog - every one is depicted as a ghetto talking grease monkey. Marlon Brando is a disgusting fat slob of a mafia boss - his offer you cant refuse scene is so laughably bad. All the rest of the cast looks like something out of a bad B movie with tough guy talk and slapping women around to be macho. James Caan is simply awful - he always trys hamming it up in every movie hes in as does Al Pacino. The movie itself is a disjointed mess with nothing but boring chatter and hearsay scenes in-between shooting people up or beating people up. Sure the mafia was bad and terrorized people but this movie just basically makes it look like a pay us for protection racket type thug movie. Overrrated,badly acted and boring. I give it a big fat zero."
5015,False,"Childish romantic view of common criminals; in no way equal to ""Goodfella's"" which really captures the truth about the underworld. The director must have been fantasizing about some imaginary Sicilian aristocracy (drinking too much vino), or simply mining a vein he knew would be commercially successful. There are excellent performances by Brando, Pacino and Caan among others, but the operatic excesses of the film make a mockery of reality. The individual performances are wasted. Not unlike ""Apocalypse Now"", ""The Godfather"" is an arrogant film with little genuine substance, and undermines an accurate understanding of the subject matter. It substitutes a yarn for a true story and, while it is entertaining, it contributes to the deterioration of our culture. Like the ""Gladiator"" it grabs your attention, then tells you lies. ""The Godfather"" is the cinematic equivalent of Baroque architecture, excessive, gaudy and not worth the work to create."
5016,False,"I also saw Godthumb first. Both are eminently more watchable and enjoyable. I actually do understand the characters and feel for them in both of those movies. But The Godfather...I just don't get why so many people say this is a great movie. Perhaps it's to be cool and one of the crowd? I was bored.Yes, there are some powerful scenes. Yes the brutality was startling back then and it still works today and fits the story, as opposed to the gratuitous and badly done violence in many movies. Yes, it was also interesting to see some amazing actors at their start. The story is even interesting so that I might be moved to read the book. However, I found the pacing too slow and the dialogue and interpersonal relationships trite and shallow. I'm glad I finally saw this and found out it doesn't really glorify the mafia because I was not moved by anyone or empathetic with their choices. I'm glad I finally saw it so I could say I did. But I won't be watching it again. I hear #2 is the best...it has to be."
5017,False,A film about post war US life. Maybe I was tired while watching it but anyway I was disappointed. Nothing more than gangster movie at all. Marlon Brando is excellent though... I`m not going to say that it`s chicken-feed but from my point view it has artificially created reputation. La Piovra - italian tv-series is much better in every point.
5018,False,the worst movie by one of the greatest director. I rented this movie because of the reviews. I was thoroughly disappointed with the garbage i wasted my time on. No Plot to hold on to throughout the movie.
5019,False,"Call me crazy, call me whatever, but I simply didn't get the movie. I think I know the reason why. After seeing 1000s of rip-offs and the motives inside this movie explored to the death in countless movies since the 70s, the initial hand-kissing scene looks pretty trite. Or the making an offer you can't refuse? Puhleeze! The movie is quite slow. I know it is all about the atmosphere, but it really is nothing special. Neither does the mumbling of Marlon Brando convey any special significance to me. Yes, he is remorseful for being a powerful leader of a criminal empire and assigning this fate to his son. Boo hoo hoo. If you don't become a crook you don't have these kinds of problems. And yes, we all get it. The aggressive son is doomed to be killed in retaliation, the ineffectual son is doomed to remain in the shadows and the resourceful son is destined to take over the ""family business"". He simply kills off his adversaries without it ever being made clear how he outsmarted them or why no one ever came for him in a similar fashion. He actually turns into quite a ruthless son-of-a-... But there is something more fundamental about why the movie isn't ""doing anything"" for me. The entire notion of ""honor"" and ""chivalry"" among criminals. It's completely fake. Now that America is mostly out of the grip of such people (not so in my own country I'm afraid, but still far from Chicago of the 20s) glorifying them is easy. The truth however is quite different. Criminals usually talk of honor, but their actions are based on much baser things. And they always have an excuse for why they ended up being crooks. Don't get suckered into believing movies like these convey any truth. Rating 5/10Scale: 10 MASTERPIECE, 9 Excellent, 8 Good, 7 OK, 6 Adequate, 5 Average, 4 Mediocre, 3 Poor, 2 Bad, 1 HORRIBLE"
5020,False,"Now I know this movie is the national pride of America, but I can't help it, it's a blown up, too long, stupid movie. Now you can say oh he's sixteen, he does know anything about movies, well you're wrong!"
5021,False,"Time and time again my friends berate me for not seeing this film and yet consider me to be something of a 'movie buff'. So they duly sat me down on Saturday night with a curry and the director's cut for my entertainment and delight.All I can say is, there's 3 hours of my life I'm never going to get back. Don't get me wrong; I'm a big fan of gangster movies, I've studied some of the early Cagney/Robinson films and seen most of the more important ones: Scarface, Casino, Goodfellas - I even stayed awake through Once Upon A Time In America. But The Godfather was agonising. Slow, meandering, overly-complicated, lacking punch - what it lashed out in bullets and horses heads, it certainly lacked in dynamite. Watching The Godfather is the cinematic equivalent of the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds; 30 years on it's impossible to see why on earth it was considered so ground-breakingly new and exciting. But by all accounts Coppolla was making a brave movie here, reintroducing a genre stuck in the 1920's and lavishing 168 minutes on the minutiae of one Mafia family.And lavish it he does. The only thing I can say in its defence is that the production design was superb, it lacked for nothing, the overall look of the film was excellent. The budget must have been colossal. What a pity the plot and the dialogue didn't live up to its promise. With a cast so huge and impressive as well, it's twice as pitiful.The legendary Marlon Brando couldn't fail to disappoint - the poor man's legend - in my opinion - far exceeded his talent. I understand the director begged Brando to come out of retirement for this, although I kind of wish he'd stayed there. His incessant mumbling, padded cheeks and all, peering out of dark corners and scratching his face just had me turning the volume way up high and becoming increasingly frustrated. Diane Keaton just played Diane Keaton/Annie Hall (her real name, trivia hounds)as usual, with an increasingly terrible haircut. She looked like she wasn't sure what she was doing in the movie any more than we did, she just looked like she wanted to go home. Her relationship with Pacino totally lacked chemistry and I found his return to her from Sicily as a widower highly unbelievable. Even Pacino's 'thunderbolt' relationship with Apollonia seemed contrived and wooden - I know he's meant to be a hard man but he remained so poker-faced throughout the movie I lost any feelings of sympathy for him.The best part I felt was played by James Caan, whose character was labelled as 'hot tempered' by his father (is that what it takes to be interesting within the Corleone family?!) so of course he met a predictably sticky end like a lot of the better characters. I found a lot of the meandering plot very predictable - to the extent where I was annoying my die-hard fans who put on the show for me, but I couldn't help it: ""Something tells me Apollonia isn't going to get out of that car"" etc. The plot didn't really go anywhere, it just seemed to be setting itself up for that sequel; every 20 minutes or so Brando/Pacino were inviting people to take advantage of 'an offer they couldn't refuse'. It was laughable.Other than Caan's, none of the characters were the slightest bit appealing; the outrageous behaviour of Tommy in Scorsese's Goodfellas, for example, is counterbalanced by his likable personality: you're laughing in spite of yourself. Pacino's protagonist in Scarface is the same - snorting copious amounts of cocaine and waving a gun around - you still care about the guy, however monstrous he's become. But Pacino in The Godfather was just a cartoon bad-ass, like the rest of them, identikit baddies with no depth whatsoever, no remorse, no weakness, no humanity, no growth. When Brando stumbles to his death among the tomato plants in play with his grandson I take that to mean that Coppolla was showing us Vito had a heart but really, it was too little too late.Coppolla may well have been brave in 1972 to reintroduce a decidedly unfashionable genre on a conservative audience, and for the time it might have been a breath of fresh air, but the glamour and pace of subsequent, better, gangster fare puts The Godfather in the shade, however responsible the film may be for the genre's future output."
5022,False,"I've got a masters in Criminology, and have studied filmography, and I just don't get it.  This isn't a great movie.  The only thing that could make it a classic is the quality of the actors that were hired - and while the actors themselves can and have made quality movies, this one just doesn't do it for me.  Brando didn't impress me in the least in this movie.And as for the portrayal of organized crime - nothing personal, but if you find it attractive to honor men who not just break the law but flout the laws of civilization, then more power to you.  Crime and criminals aren't glamorous - they're a sore on the backside of humanity that should be expunged."
5023,False,"I was finally forced to watch this 'masterpiece'.  What, exactly, is the redeeming feature of this movie that all these film 'elites' love so much.It was a long, boring, tedious experience I would never want to repeat. Watching old men convince young men to kill other old men was pointless. Was there an actual point to the story?  Or was it crafted just to sell the next installment.This movie has no business being so well-liked and shows what is wrong with both American cimema and the IMDB ranking system."
5024,False,I saw this movie twice. It's an alright movie but really has noexceptional value. Certainly not as much as everyone seems tothink. I believe people heap praise upon it because other peopleTELL them this is the best movie ever. I say to those people growa backbone and watch some better movies.
5025,False,"The Cordleone family is modeled on a Mafia family which existed. The Mario Puzo novel was highly fictionalized & made for an interesting premise. The classic line from this film ""I'm going to make them an offer they can't refuse,"" has become the most clich√© line ever uttered from a film.Marlon Brando was well suited for his role in this plodding drama. The 2008 restoration of the Godfather by Copola on DVD brings this film, not only back to original form but even better. The set available now has all 3 films plus extras. When I watched to original now restored, I realized just how great this movie is.This film takes it time telling it's story and it is much more classic story telling over action. The restoration makes the dark film play much better than older prints I have seen before. It is in 5 speaker sound for home theater systems. After seeing how good this original is, I am looking foreword to checking out 2 & 3.James Caan, Abe Vigoda head a stellar list of folks supporting Brando here with incredible acting by Al Pacino as the son heir apparent. There is plenty of reason to watch this restored version. It is done with an obvious flair and once you watch this, you easily forget HBO's poor relative, The Sopranos. If they face Brando, they wouldn't last 5 minutes."
5026,False,"Although I have a high regard for THE GODFATHER as a gutsy crime melodrama, I would not place it as the #1 film of all time. That place in cinema history should still go to GONE WITH THE WIND, in my opinion.But it's a brilliant piece of work, gorgeously photographed, extremely well crafted throughout with everyone in the cast perfectly suited to their roles.I read the Mario Puzo novel and it's as though each actor was hand- picked for their roles with uniform precision. Highest ranking among the performances are MARLON BRANDO (although I needed the caption feature to catch all of his mumbled words), AL PACINO, who practically carries the main part of the story with a very earnest, very strong portrayal of the favorite son, JAMES CAAN as the hot-headed Sonny, and DIANE KEATON as the romantic interest (Kay) for Pacino. All of the others do stand-out work, particularly RICHARD COSTELLANO as Clemenza.Rumors that some of the details reflect the story behind Frank Sinatra's desperate quest for the role of Maggio in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY are apparently quite true. After all, here the crooning son who needs to save his fading singing career is eager to get a serious role in a war film that is just right for his own Italian persona. We learn that his sweetheart is also the object of lust by a studio head who has spent millions turning her into a studio star only to risk losing her as a property if she marries the crooner. Sound familiar? It should. Think Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra. Or even Sinatra and Kim Novak. (Is Harry Cohn the lecherous producer???) But just how many of these details are true, I don't know. I like to think that author Mario Puzo invented some of them.Aside from this aspect of the story, which culminates in a very famous and bloody comeuppance for the uncooperative producer, there are plenty of other gripping sequences where we know something bad is about to happen because of the various injustices within the crime families. This is the hook that ties all of the sequences together and maintains suspense right up until the final touching scene.A brilliant piece of work--but still not at the top of my ""favorite movie"" list. It's a well-structured crime story by a man who really knew how to write for this genre--and a man (Francis Ford Coppola) who really knew how to direct this sort of crime melodrama, so meticulously detailed and realistically set in the 1940s."
5027,False,"This is the greatest movie ever made. It not only gives an interesting view on the mafia, but it teaches many valuable lessons and ideas, for which a good example is in the first scene, the meeting between the Don and Bonasera (""What did I ever do to deserve such disrespect?""). I am 13 now, and the first time I saw this movie was when I was 8. The Godfather has definitely made me smarter and prepared me for the independence of being a teenager. I would recommend if your child is 8+ and has not seen this movie that they watch it right away. I have the full box set, and have seen them all numerous times. The third was disappointing though, with dry acting, repetitive plot, and many awkward moments between Sofia Coppola and Al Pacino. I was also glad that the first two movies did not have too much violence, although there is a fair amount of Thompson guns in them. I have a habit of quoting Brando, who plays a character who delivers some of the most powerful, meaningful lines in any movie I have seen. I have seen most of Brando's movies, from Streetcar to Missouri breaks to the Freshman, in which his lines are so unique and unconventionally spoken they sometimes make me laugh. It was a true shame for Brando to die at the not-too-old age of 80, although he was not in good health at the time. Although many people are sure to claim the fame that Brando accomplished, I will always remember him to be the greatest actor ever."
5028,False,"I hate reviewing classic movies, since most have a reputation and I feel like I'm not an actual moviegoer/critic if I don't like the classics or give them a certain rating. Anyway, I finally got to see The Godfather. I was a little disappointed, but I still liked it.In Francis Ford Coppola's Mario Puzo's The Godfather, Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone, son of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), a famous family mafia. The film goes through their various escapades as a crime family.I really, really enjoyed watching The Godfather. The almost-three-hour runtime seemed to fly by. I was enthralled by the sincerity of the acting and the horrible true-to-life feel of the film. All of the acting was dead-on, although some of the screaming could have been a little better. With up-and-coming stars at the time such as Al Pacino, how can you go wrong?However, with all movies, they can't be perfect. The film could, or should, have had more plot to it. I know it's supposed to be ""a day in the life of"" type movie, but if it had been with one adventure for most of the way it would have helped. Also, there were lots of supporting characters who we can't remember about for three hours. If that wasn't enough, all of the characters looked like either tall or fat white men with thick Italian accents, making them hard to understand (and of course I had to rent the VHS version so I couldn't read subtitles). More towards the end, I couldn't tell who was on whose side. The ending could have been trimmed down a little; the last half hour or so seemed to actually be boring and not very exciting. Maybe Coppola put it in there so the movie could have the designation of being ""one of those long classics"".I was surprised about how little strong language there was for a crime movie like this. I would have guessed all the characters to be swearin' like a sailor, but I was surprised. The amount of blood didn't surprise me, but I commend Coppola for putting so much in.Pacino looked like he does now, minus bags under his eyes. Brando gained about 200 pounds after The Godfather. And, Abe Vigoda looks exactly the same as he did thirty years ago. Yes, that's right. Abe Vigoda is in this movie. Hurray!The Godfather is an entertaining movie that is overrated but still fun to watch as three hours pass.My rating: 7/10Rated R for strong violence, blood, brief nudity, and constant but mainly minor profanity."
5029,False,"No doubt a good movie, but to place it among the top ten is foolish. It hasn't introduced anything new at any cinematic level. Its influence on the living trends of cinema is practically zero (no interesting movie made after The Godfather owes anything to it). It's the paradigmatic example of what Fredric Jameson calls nostalgia cinema, a pastiche of the old conventions of gangster movies, a kind of funerary monument. Classical cinema ended long time ago (probably in the fifties), and this movie is just a well-done late survivor, a kind of aesthetic dinosaur."
5030,False,"Italian films have quite often come under some sort of controversy, in large part because of the fact that Italian immigrants have been given an undeserved reputation of being inherently violent and universally tied to some sort of organized crime. Mass media is one of the main reasons for this, which is why Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather instigated such fierce opposition and controversy when it was released in 1972. Coppola has insisted that the film is not about Italians involved in organized crime, but that it is instead a metaphorical representation of the American government. Personally, I don't believe that at all, if only because no one is going to watch a film like that and overlook exactly what they see and make the connection between the film and the American government.
However, this does not take away from the overall accomplishment that the film makes. The genius of The Godfather lies in Coppola's obvious directing skills, as well as author Mario Puzo's skill as a storyteller. The film tells the story of five tremendously powerful crime families that are at war with one another, but no one seems to be quite sure who committed the crimes that instigated the war, which makes for an interesting investigation as a subplot. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone is one of the best in history, and one of the major accomplishments of the film as a whole is that it is able to take this man, who is really a despicable person, and make him into an endearing character that we really care about. He is the leader of a crime family, but he is made into an antagonist. The film twists things around like that, which is one of the things that really makes it so watch-able. Aside from making Don Corleone into such a likeable character, he is also made to be tremendously respectable. Personally, I noticed this because I watched The Godfather again recently while going through and watching all of the James Bond films. Here is James Bond, who is supposed to be one of the most tasteful, refined, and high-class figures in action film, and Brando's Don Corleone effortlessly makes even Sean Connery's Bond look like a Spice Girl. The story of The Godfather is complex and involved enough to have taken up three very long films, and they are tied together brilliantly. This film ends with Vito Corleone's son Michael taking over his leadership position, in a scene that doesn't only leave room for a sequel, but demands one. The film ends with Michael Corleone in his father's office, being addressed by two of his father's assistants as Don Corleone, a title attributed only to his father until that point in the film. It would have been an unsatisfactory to end the film that way without continuing the story, and this was done two years later, with yet another Best Picture winner. The Godfather is a landmark in film history, because of the incredible story, the astronomical performances, the expert direction, and the picture perfect cinematography. The film is literally packed with memorable and famous scenes, and the performances from everyone involved are spectacular. Even at three hours, The Godfather never gets boring or slow. It is a stunningly intense ride from beginning to end."
5031,False,"Some memorable sequences, in particular a string of assassinations intercut with the family at church, but too many overly long scenes.  To me the film seems disjointed, and is let down by poor central performances (yes poor) by Brando (hammy), Pacino (stiff) and Keaton (invisible).The Conversation, which Coppola directed a couple of years later, is a better film, with a brilliant performance from Hackman.  But even that takes an hour to get moving."
5032,False,"I think the movie was okay, but could have accomplished much more.  I, personally, believe that the movie was way too long.  There were a number of scenes and shots which served no purpose to the actual story line that could have been edited out and which made parts of it slow and dull.  I realize that most of these were made for benefit of the director's artistic vision, but art doesn't always make for good story telling -- just look at 2001."
5033,False,"Am I seemingly in a very small minority that find gangster films so soo sooo very dull. I concede that The Godfather is the most famous of this genre but as for it forever topping film polls I'm not so sure. And when I say not sure I mean Definitely not! I also admit that I'm not a Brando fan but if this film is meant to be the best of the best it shouldn't matter if I like Brando or not, I should still like the film right?, and I just don't. My dad is the biggest Brando fan and even he doesn't reach for this film when he fancies a bit of marlon. In my opinion Carlito's Way or The Untouchables are far superior 'films'of the genre. I think the main problem I have with The Godfather other then the never ending dullness of it, is that it always seems to be saying 'oh look isn't cool to be in the mob, we should all do it'. Of course it all goes belly up the the boys in the end but thats just a convention of the genre that has to be met, rather then being the message of the film. Not my cup of tea at all I'm afraid."
5034,False,"When it comes to a discussion about the popularity of American cinema, it can be stated that there is hardly any American film as famous as ""The Godfather""-a film which has caught the attention of cinema admirers all over the world. While watching the film, at first sight, viewers wouldn't lose much time to learn that the gangsters portrayed in ""The Godfather"" don't care at all for human lives as business interests come before anything else. Hence, it is perfectly normal for a man to get his brother-in-law killed as he has been disloyal to his family. It is the violent scenes of this kind which aim to terrify without being gory. From a cultural point of view, the ubiquitous discourse about American values of Italian gangsters in America make Francis Ford Coppola's film an intellectually rich viewing experience wherein there is ample spotlight on participating in family gatherings, looking well after family members and choosing to converse in English instead of Italian. Apart from the character with a crooked face- actor Marlon Brando who garners all of viewers' sympathies, good performances have come from other leading players namely Robert Duvall, Al Pacino and James Caan. However, exquisite photography by veteran American cinematographer Gordon Willis and great Italian composer Nino Rota are two more reasons for watching this film about a ruthless family of criminals who left Italian shores to wreck havoc in a new land of dreams."
5035,False,"We know from Gay Talese's book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn't all sunshine and roses. More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of ""The Godfather,"" which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.""The Godfather"" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old- fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.But Brando's performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whispery, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although ""The Godfather"" is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn't time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he'll have to cancel his day at the races).The success of ""The Godfather"" as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garrotings.Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so ""The Godfather"" becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they'd tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn't have worked. But it's uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish- brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other."
5036,False,"Many words have been written about ""The Godfather"" since debut in 1972 and no doubt that all words are quite flattering, but always worth a few cents more about this great movie. The work, directed by then newcomer director Coppola, was awarded in the launch year and continued to receiving well-deserved awards, until soon became a landmark of international cinema . With substantial actors and flawless performance of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the story has traces of a true work of art. Its soundtrack also awarded, is absolutely amazing and remarkable. Who does not hear the chords of the soundtrack by Nino Rota and automatically remember the movie ?Additionally all, ""The Godfather "" is a portrait of its time period and so it goes on all the other works of the trilogy. The film is built upon a significant historical period, shows not only the role of foreign immigrants and their difficulties in building an identity in America as it is also very thorough in addressing how the Italian mafia was organized for several decades in USA. For this and more, "" The Godfather "" is a film which must be seen, a reference that needs to be seen by all those who love movies and want to understand the social development of the United States at the beginning of the last century."
5037,False,"Title says it all. yo. This movie is so boring. If you actually decide to watch this piece of **** you should contemplate purchasing a pair of noise canceling headphones and a blindfold. Seriously. I'm being super serious you guys. This movie is super annoying. Like seriously, remember that scene in Airplane where the women literally dies from boredom? That will be you son if you don't listen to me and decide to watch this movie. I'm trying to do you guys a favor. Would I really write all this sh*t if I didn't care about your well being? Also, by the way, if you pause at exactly 50:42 and scream ""For the glory of Satan"" you will get one million dollars. No kidding. Screw Peter Pan. That kid is so annoying. Like this movie."
5038,False,"Some things are just meant to be perfect, flawless and well, godly. The Godfather , by Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo is . The way every aspect of filmmaking and storytelling compliments the other in this unforgettable film causes one to wonder ( really) if such a feat can be repeated, ever .I always have the highest regard for the script before anything associated with films , therefore I'd like to talk about Godfather's screenplay first .Adapted from Mario Puzo's novel of the same name The Godfather is all about a man's relationship with his family and his responsibilties towards it, that can cause him to abandon his own dreams and ambitions. That this setup is showcased by one of the most powerful mafia families in 1940s New York makes it all the more interesting . The simple plot being that the head of the Corleone crime family is aging and other crime bosses want him out of the way seems rather straightforward. Enter Don Vito Corleone's youngest son Michael aka 'the innocent college boy' - as his elder brother and apparent heir Sonny Corleone likes to call him - along with a girl. He sums up his life and all that he expects from it in future in one line - ""This is my family Kay , not me. "" Quite clearly the kid wants nothing to do with his crime family or its power. But this family thrives on crime and inevitably becomes a victim as well. After Vito refuses to deal with a narcotics kingpin named Virgil Sollozo, he sets off a chain of events that alters his family and business structure forever. Even a man who has experienced all that life could offer fails to see what's coming and expresses his surprise later on. A heartbreaking and mind numbing tale of how a powerful crime family comes to terms with all that it feeds on and how the same entities almost destroy the family was , is and will remain unforgettable .The number of memorable scenes and dialouges is mind boggling. The scene where the Don delivers his famous line "" I'm gonna make him ......."" is enough to express the immeasurable power that the man possesses . And the one where a proud Hollywood producer awakes to find on his bed a ....... , or the restaurant where Michael ......... , or when Sonny pays the price for being hotheaded , and when the Don talks to his son , or when Michael does what he is destined to do, The Godfather overflows with great scenes. The music and cinematography by Nino Rota and Gordon Willis respectively contribute greatly to the film's overall impact .The Godfather can never be mentioned without naming Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in the same breath. The level of acting is just ""Oh My Gosh"" . While Brando is great and very believable as Vito Corleone , Al Pacino is and will always remain the one and only choice for Michael Corleone . It is said that Brando developed the mannerisms of Vito himself and if so , then he absolutely deserves his Oscar . Al Pacino transforms Michael from the ideal son to the guy he eventually becomes making sure that one is overwhelmed by the portrayal . Not once have i mentioned in my tribute ( i ain't that great enough to review The Godfather) that The Godfather is a person, because he isn't and as the Hindi film ' Sarkar' , influenced heavily by The Godfather , says "" The Godfather is not a man , but an idea."" Just that this idea created history.Note: As much as i don't want to mention it , i do really feel that there is one sequence in the film that required the editor's attention. But nonetheless , it only appears as such in repeated viewings and not the first one . So set aside your coke and popcorn because you're not just watching any other flick , you are watching the greatest of them all and after the conclusion you'll realise that the coke and popcorn are as they were when the words The Godfather appeared on the screen some three hours ago ."
5039,False,"The Godfather is probably the most perfect movie ever made. A strong plot, a unique cast, direction, filming and editing are beyond words, and the music makes you blend in. There are other great movies of course, but some of them lack one or two things mentioned above. It's difficult to match this one. Francis Coppola probably did that with The Godfather Part II (1974), and he may have exceeded himself. The Godfather is such a masterpiece that you can watch it over and over again and you will never be bored but always surprised how wonderful it is. Just to see young Al Pacino change for a college boy to a ruthless mafioso is a miracle of movie-making, even more so than Marlon Brando in the title role, albeit a small one. But the most underrated role and actor in both the Godfather movies is Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen."
5040,False,"How do you define a movie's greatness? For me, it's pretty straightforward; mainly the direction, the script, and the acting. And the Godfather triumphs on every level. Coppola and Puzo have created an epic tale of a powerful mafioso patriarch passing his crown down to his unwilling son, and the shift of power unfolds brilliantly with betrayal, vengeance and tragedy.Marlon Brando delivers one of the most intensive performances ever seen in film seemingly effortlessly. His calm demeanor carries along a subtly powerful and intimidating presence. Al Pacino is a revelation in his first role in a major film, displaying his range as he moves from the role of a heroin addict in The Panic in Needle Park, to the reluctant successor of the Don who transforms from the righteous war hero into a ruthless king. James Caan is PERFECT for the hot-headed Sonny, as is Robert Duvall as the intelligent Tom Hagen and John Cazale as the tragic figure of Fredo.I will run out of superlatives if I continue. Overall, The Godfather is a timeless classic that will always be the epitome of how a truly magnificent epic film should be."
5041,False,"The Godfather has set the boundaries off all crime drama films that have ever been shown to people around the world. No one, will ever go beyond this film, it is truly magnificent. The film shows how the Corleone crime family want revenge on the men that tried to destroy them and there old beloved Don. Don Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando can been seen as some greatest acting that has ever been placed inside Hollywood. The famous line ""I'll make him an offer he cant refuse"" will always be rembered. Brando plays a character that is a family man, who wants to keep his family safe from the underwold. As well as to get out of the family business. He man who never wanted his sons to go join him, but yet he could do nothing about it. He is man of respect, a man who knows when the right time is, no matter what the situatuion is. He is the Godafther. When he was nealry killed by the drug baron called Sollozzo, he knew that his time as Don was up. He knew that there would be war, bloodshed,and that he could do nothung until he was ready again. His oldest son who was hot headed, angary, but a wonderful tactican like a general could never run this family. His second son Fredo was not man enough to to do his job. He youngest son though, the person who killed Sollozzo, was a calm, thoughtfull, ruthless man, and would be the person to take over the family business. Even to his displeasure, that he never wanted this to happen to his son at all, he knew it was the right thing to help bring back the weakened Corleone Crime Family, into where they belong. The king of the American Mafia Underworld, and the only way to do it is to destroy the five familes of New York."
5042,False,I first watched this movie a few months ago and I loved it. I decided to watch it since I had heard it was one of the best movies ever made. And I now agree with those who said that. I thought that this is one of the best movies as it was well scripted and the characters were strong. Francis Ford Coppola casted some of the best actors for this movie.The first time I watched it I loved it but I had to watch it a second time as I didn't get what some of it was about. But from the first time I watched this movie I knew it was a masterpiece.Some people say that is is overrated but in my opinion you could not overrate The Godfather no matter how hard you try. But that is my opinion.Marlon Brando did an amazing job portraying Don Corleone and he made me want to watch this movie over and over again as he just amazed me with his brilliant acting. Al Pacino gave an astounding performance as Michael Corleone and it is this film that made him my favourite actor. James Caan wowed me as Tom Hagen and his character was one of my favourites in The Godfather.I loved this film and I could watch it over and over again and not get bored. In my opinion this movie is a definite must see.I hope this review helped you.
5043,False,"And he wasn't wrong. After recently viewing this masterpiece of American film for the first time it is understood why it has earned such acclaim for so many years. It is hard to put into the words how beautiful and flawless The Godfather really is, all I can say is that it is the most brilliant saga of family, business, and crime ever captured on camera.One of the greatest qualities about The Godfather is its craft. The craft is impeccable in this film. This must be credited to the fantastic cast (from Marlon Brando to Al Pacino to James Caan and even to Abe Vigoda) and to one of the greatest directors of American cinema: Francis Ford Coppola. No other man could have unraveled such a craftily built epic that The Godfather is and remains today. Coppola and co-screenwriter Mario Puzo (who wrote the novel The Godfather) wrote the greatest screenplay Hollywood has seen. And it is due to the genius of both of these two gentlemen that The Godfather came to be.Two scenes in the movie that prove the brilliance of this film are the fateful diner sequence and the fantastic ending. Micheal's emotion is so ever present in that scene it is like you are right there with him holding the gun, focused on killing the man that attempted the murder of his father. You are with Micheal. Brilliant Scene. I also love the ending in which the door closes on Kay who has just watched Clemenza kiss the hand of Don Michael Corleone, her husband. Best final scene I have ever witnessed.In final, I return to my opening remarks and Stanley Kubrick's quote, ""The Godfather is possibly the greatest movie ever made."" To me, this statement is amazing. This came from Kubrick...KUBRICK!...quite possibly the greatest filmmaker that ever lived. That just goes to show how powerful The Godfather is. I love this movie and all who love the art of film-making are in debt to the men and women who gave us this film.10/10 If you haven't seen it, watch it. And if you have seen it, watch it again."
5044,False,"If you're reading this comment to decide if you should watch ""The Godfather,"" then I truly have no comment to that. That would mean that the #1 of 250 ranking on the title page, the name ""Francis Ford Coppola,"" the cast list including Marlon Brando, the ""won Oscar for best picture"" and the phrase ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse"" mean absolutely nothing to you.This is the greatest crime drama if not the greatest drama if not the greatest film of all time, so yes, it is worth your time. Then you need to watch ""The Godfather: Part II.""This is a deep, enriching and beautiful film in every sense of those words and will forever echo through cinematic history.Looking for any other sweeping statements? I could go on and on. You can't say anything bad about this film. You could say 175 minutes is too long, but if that's what it takes for a masterpiece, so be it.If it's not every bit of what I said it is, the canolli's on me."
5045,False,"The Godfather has become over the years a classic and many consider it to be one of the best films ever made, this is truly deserved. Everything about the film is perfect and I simply cant think of anything that shouldn't be there as every single thing screams perfection. The performances by everyone are absolutely magnificent and possibly the best ensemble cast performance of all time, the actors live in their roles and do everything is done perfectly down to the last little detail, the screenplay and storyline are magnificent as the story evolves you get a engrossed in it and every second is epic, all the themes are well presented and the acting just makes everything stronger, I wasn't bored for a second. The music (original and not) is perfect and goes with the film and every time you hear it it reminds you of the film and the characters. This film is just the first out of three in the great Corleone saga but although i award the other two a 10/10 this one is the best in my opinion simply because it has so many memorable cinematic scenes that are some of the best in history but the other two films complete this one and add more to the story. All that said this movie should not be missed and anyone who enjoys cinema needs to check this out and then follow the rest of the story with the others. A true classic. 10/10"
5046,False,"I saw the movie some years back mainly due to the hype.. I liked it & would have given it 6/10 at that time..Three years later I bought the book(accidentally).. Well just for the sake of buying something really wasn't going to read it anyway (so I thought)..A few days later I read a few pages & started loving it.. I was hooked on to the book like a Harry Potter fan & couldn't put it down..THEN..I watched the movie ... Then I knew why there was so much hype around the movie even after 30 years...The movie just brought back the characters to life...I loved it & thus the rating 9.6/10 However the movie is not as good as the book.... but I think it's as close a movie will ever get to the original.. Which by the way is a masterpiece..The casting for the movie is flawless..You really feel that they belong in the book..All in all The Godfather won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Writing (adapted screenplay) (Francis Coppola, Mario Puzo)... The film was nominated for eight additional Academy Awards. Furthermore, it won five Golden Globes, one Grammy, and numerous other awards...My final piece of advice...""READ THE BOOK THEN WATCH THE MOVIE""If you really want to enjoy it.."
5047,False,"The Godfather is the best movie ever made. Marlon Brando played his part so well. Al Pacino also played is part well as well. The setting was fantastic and the plot was engaging. The use of camera work was just outstanding. I don't know why anyone would hate this film. It is the best gangster/mobster ever produced. This movie is way better than 'Goodfellas' or 'Scarface'. This movie had so many Oscar winning actors which boosted the rating of this movie right up. There are some action scenes in this movie and they are fantastic to watch. But the best part of the movie has to be the acting and how engaging the characters are. For everyone who was reluctant to get this movie, I suggest you buy this film or hire it out because it is a blast."
5048,False,"Very few movie dads come off worse than Vito Corleone. As he postures and pretends to be a man of honor and a man who loves his family, he's all the time setting in motion the elements that will wound or destroy his kids. No man is in the Mafia unless he's just a greedy SOB. So, Don Corleone mortgages his children's future at a very high interest rate in order to become a multimillionaire off of bootlegging, labor-union corruption, gambling and loan-sharking. One son is horribly murdered by a thousand bullets, his only daughter, Connie, is eventually left an embittered and tragic widow before she turns 25, his grandson by Connie is left orphaned thanks to in-house vengeance, his eldest son is corrupted and eventually under the mob thumb in Vegas and his idealistic youngest boy is overwhelmed by the old Mafia game and eventually seizes headship of The Commission by committing one of the worst mass-murders in New York history. Don Vito said in the third scene of this movie, ""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man."" He should have focused on demonstrating values to his family, not just spending all that time with them."
5049,False,"Filmed over 30 years ago, i believe that The Godfather to this day, is simply the best movie ever made. To be honest, i think that before they make another movie this good, particularly in this genre, we will be watching it with our children's children...if we're lucky.I had to watch The Godfather more than once to realise that this movie is actually more about family than the mafia or the underworld. Most of the vengeance and deaths in this movie are not caused by money or greed. They are for family. I must say i haven't seen a movie before that gives this much importance to family. Particularly Al Pacino's character - Michael does an unbelievable turn around when it comes to his family. It's just incredible. At first reluctant to get involved with the family business, Michael soon becomes more ambitious and tougher than everyone else, again only for his family.The fact that this movie is non clich√© makes it more enjoyable to watch. It's not predictable in a sense where the good guy wins and bad guy loses eventually. It's so much more realistic than that. I have nothing bad to say about the length, editing and definitely about the cast. Al Pacino especially just continues to surprise me with how good he portrays his character. He is no doubt the best actor in Hollywood. Some people may find The Godfather very slow, dark and depressing. It's not the loudest and most 'vibrant' movie, but that's kind of the whole point. I believe those people should then stop watching movies from this genre, because if you did not like this one...you won't like any. No words and reviews can do this movie justice and i believe that unlike some over rated, inflated movies The Godfather actually deserves its big reputation of being a masterpiece and one of the best movies ever made. without a doubt...10/10"
5050,False,"What can I say about ""the godfather"" that has not been said before? That it is a masterpiece? That its staff is just wonderful? That the actors and soundtrack are superb? That it is considered one of the best films ever? Actually I don't know what more say, but it is true that it is hard to see more deserved good marks. I had never the opportunity of watching to it in original version and, when I did it, I could perfectly realize the fabulous wonder I was able to enjoy, Marlon Brando is just impressive, Al Pacino is as good as him, and James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton deserved to be congratulated. Thanks to Coppola, for giving us the pleasure of watching ""the Godfather"""
5051,False,"Many who have viewed this film consider it one of the best films ever, if not the best film ever made. The performance by Marlon Brando is legendary and iconic. The plot development and character development by far is heads above any other film that I have have had the pleasure of seeing. What in my opinion stands out above all in this film and perhaps the most understated and unappreciated film performances ever.Al Pacino played what I believe to be the most believable and powerful performance in film history. The complexity of Michael Corleone and his slow and uncontrolled spiral into the dark side of power and influence.Never before have I seen a more complete and developed performance; it is as if you see this idealistic young man forced into a life he rejected, only to become the most ruthless and feared crime figure of all time,all the while maintaining a realism and not going over the top much like the Tony Montana Character Pacino Played in Scarface. Displaying power and intimidation with minimal effort or any threatening physical attributes Pacino is able to let us as the viewers delve deep in to the soul of this tortured young man and see the birth of power hungry perverse monster who carries himself like a wolf in sheep's clothing. It was a crime that this stellar performance was not awarded with the academy award. The first two films of this trilogy allows us to see Al Pacino reach the pinnacle of acting, closing out what might be considered the best overall character performance in a film series with a truly under appreciated and powerful performance in the Godfather Part III. Pacino's performance in the Godfather in my opinion is the single best performance in film history, and the Godfather is the greatest American film ever made."
5052,False,"Anyone speak Italian who can translate the restaurant scene between Solozzo and Mike. I understand that they didn't use the subtitle in order to add to the scene's tension; but for my curiosity, I want to know what was said. Can anybody help a sista out? lol (I'm somewhat new to IMDb as far as comments go, and it's telling me that I have to have a minimum of 10 lines but I don't have anything else to say or ask so I'm just gonna keep writing this pointless stuff here. Why do I have to have a minimum of ten lines. I'm only at eight right now so I guess I have to keep writing. Yeah, now I'm at nine, one more to go. And I'm done. thanx! :-)"
5053,False,"Francis Ford Coppola, maybe, didn't think in 1972 that this film would have become a cinematic icon. It's like a show business fairy tale: the young director needed a hit, he had debts and Paramount commissioned him to direct a movie based on Mario Puzo's bestseller. Coppola hired a big forgotten star -Marlon Brando- and some young and relatively unknown actors -Pacino, Caan, Duvall and Diane Keaton. Federico Fellini's music composer (Nino Rota) wrote the soundtrack. The film was shot in Sicily, New York and California. The rest is history.""The Godfather"" is a novel about an Italian-American family and the relationships in the Mafia. It's not only a blockbuster, it is also a deep study of characters. Coppola says that ""Godfather"" is a metaphorical vision of power in America... We can see this especially in ""Part Two"", which is not just a sequel: it's another chapter, where Coppola shows more contradictions in US society -Mafia's reign talks more and more with the other social and political institutions. (Martin Scorsese, for his Mafia's movies, chooses a more neurotic way of telling stories, whereas Coppola prefer a more classical style for his tales and likes to novelize the events.).""The Godfather"" (1972): we know the Corleone's family and the way a clan keeps its power. There are rhythm, action, drama. And strong acting performances.""The Godfather, Part Two"" (1974): the story goes on. A more bitter trip into the power and the loneliness of a Boss. The highlight is the combination of two parallel stories -Robert De Niro is the young Vito Corleone, and Al Pacino is the established ""Don"" Michael in the Sixties. It's the best sequel ever realized, maybe better than the original film.""The Godfather, Part Three"" (1990): not as good as the two previous -actually it is much inferior to them, it was made too many years later. Some allusions to Italian mysteries (the death of businessman Roberto Calvi, the P2 lodge) are quite superficial. For the rest, the movie is well directed. Pacino is more Shakespearean -Coppola says like King Lear...A must for the new Hollywood movies lovers. The first two chapters in particular."
5054,False,"In contrast to part 2 this is more loosely structured and sometimes less climactic and also seems more improvised. But thanks to the enormous effort put to detailed cinematography and camera-work it lends itself more to repeated viewings. (One example: when Vito is about to be shot there's a poster on the grocery store announcing a fight of Jake LaMotta thus foreshadowing the assassination attempt).Probably the most interesting is the light and dark contrast between the outer, ordinary world and the inner, godfather world. Even when these two worlds meet in one shot they are still strictly separated by showing two rooms in a way where you watch one world from the other (the end shot e.g. where Kay is seen in one room and the men in another: then the door shuts).Very effective use of mirrors (reflection), doors (separating worlds) and windows (showing perspective). From the back-to-back shots and other shots where an object obscures the picture we can see where many modern filmmakers get their ideas (Kar-Wai for example).Coppola has himself watched Antonioni very well: Scenes where only buildings or spaces are shown to create an alienating effect or just loneliness combined with tension (hospital scene). Or characters disappear and only a static shot of the room is seen to signify emptiness (fight between Connie and Carlo).Especially the end scene is well edited and composed: But they even improved on that scene just two years later."
5055,False,"I appreciate this movie as a very good piece of cinema but i really cant understand why its #1 in the Top250.Ok the performances are solid, the direction is fluid and the story tight, but it isn't one of those movies you leave the theatre feeling your life is changed or anything like that...Greatest movie of all time? I think not."
5056,False,"This movie was probably relevant in the 70s and may have been a benchmark at the time it was made. Watching it in 2006, I can see how it added to the movie landscape and that effect that it had on subsequent film making.Some of the film is amazing, but mostly it goes on and on. It is very long, with some of the scenes taking an age, without really adding to the atmosphere or the point. These are not impressive pauses, silences, looks, stares, or useful dwelling time, simply editing that never happened.This film is worth seeing as a history lesson in film, to get an understanding of the development of the genre, but anybody who has seen goodfellas, casino, or any other mob flick is unlikely to find the moral tale worth the journey."
5057,False,As a 19 yr old watching this film recently for my first time I simply cant see this film continuing to be considered the best film of all time.Yes the acting is good and the script is very smooth but there are large chunks of this film that can only be described as horribly boringNearly everyone I know in my generation agrees this is highly overrated so I think its only a matter of time before another film lifts it off top spot (hopefully Shawshank redemption - although return of the king is more likely)4/10
5058,False,"In my opinion a good movie is one that makes you feel diffrent when you leave the theater, or puts a feeling on you that you haven't experienced. You have a true feeling that you got just by watching somthing.I also ask what makes and entertaining movie. To me its one that you just cant get enough of. You can watch over and over again and it never gets old."
5059,False,"I don't see what anybody saw in this movie, boring, and redundant. I was bored with the film, and it is a horrible attempt to make a good movie. If you have any taste what so ever you will turn down a crapfest like this and watch something respectful like Batman, or The Rookie, or heck even Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. In any event stay away from this waste of film. 0 out of 10."
5060,False,"The godfather all in all is a great movie and the best in the organised crime genre but putting it as the number one movie in the top 250 films of all time and the top of countless lists is too much. The roles of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are excllent but the film on a whole is very over rated.  The direction is good not excellent,  the script is by no means ground breaking.  But many people still refer to it as the best film ever made.  Next time you watch this movie compare the script to something with more life and wit(eg fight club) and more lavish directing."
5061,False,"I hate mob movies and even though this is a classic, the genre means it is less than desirable. Mob movies have one thing in common: they are SLOW! Their main theme is character development and the characters they develop are not worth knowing."
5062,False,I dont see the big deal about this movie. I think it sucks. Everyone always talks about how good it is and that it's a classicand it makes me just want to tape their mouths shut. This movie does not deserve such a high rating.
5063,False,"This is a very good movie that is very overrated.  I  agree that it belongs on the top 250 list, bust its rank as the best movie of all time is slightly overblown.  It is a movie thats popularity has stemmed from the American fascination with the the Mafia."
5064,False,"I really don't understand people sometimes.  Here we have the #1 rated movie on the list.  An extremely famous film.  A well made film in it's own right. But the story.  It's AWFUL.This is a story about a man how starts off as a fine upstanding citizen, a soldier, no less, and his gradual change into what I can only describe as a Total S**t.I really did NOT like this movie.  I did like it up to a point...once I realized that Michael was not going to overcome his demons.
I really don't feel I should waste any more time on this film, so I won't."
5065,False,"When a prestige movie is made, utmost attention is given to detail, grandeur, style, and above all, popularity.  Godfather was a movie made to honor the great work of Mario Puzo, who wrote a novel that brought true attention to the human side of the gangster/mobster.  Capolla knew that he had embarked on a great mission when he set out to perform the unthinkable: to show the world that the leaders in crime have souls, and that they are certainly not invincible.  This movie was what it was meant to be, a prestige movie, it took very few risks, and was filmed to simply document the lives of its characters.I found the Godfather to be a very well done movie.  In fact, I enjoyed this movie so much that I have watched it on many occasions.  This movie serves as a soap opera of the gangster world to me, and it tells its story very well.  However, I do not believe that any film of this character should be given such a high accord in the Top 100 ranking.  The highest position on the rating scale should be given to a movie that fulfills the requirements of a movie to the tee.  The godfather does not do this as precisely as other movies.People go to see movies simply to be displaced from their ordinary lives. To be transported to another world, life, place, or perspective.  The godfather does a very feeble attempt at fulfilling this essential requirement.  Not at one moment in this movie does the audience become disconnected with themselves.  There is not a single instance where the actions on the screen become real, and where the world in which the audience is watching from fades away.  To those of us who believe in the true excellence of movies, the Godfather does not rate anywhere near the `best movie of all time'.Movies such as Moulin Rouge, Citizen Kane, Requiem for a Dream, the Matrix, Casablanca, Momento, and even (depending on the viewer) Gladiator, all grasp the viewer by their hair, and thrust them into another world, if for only a few seconds.  The movie watching experience is topped by this disconnection from the real world.  It leaves us in a feeling of awe, and shows us that the movie we just watched was more than just a movie, but a journey into the minds of the characters on the screen, and in some unique cases, a journey into the great depths of our own minds.  With this sort of depth and greatness, these types of movies should be all in the top 10.This unique greatness is not easily achieved.  In order to capture the audience in such a thrilling way, a great deal of effort must be spend meticulously building up the pace and timing of the movie.  The climax should be the point where the viewer has already been captured into the movie, and should thus create a `climatic experience', thus blowing the viewer away.  The Godfather has none of these elements perfected to such a state that they encapsulate the viewing public to a degree worthy of its ranking.So it is therefore obvious that The Godfather does not reach the greatness of a few other better movies, and so it is not deserving of its top ranking. If it were up to me, I would move the Godfather down to 5 or 6, and leave room the real screen gems to be appreciated.This movie gets a rating of 9 out of 10"
5066,False,"what a load of hogwash.absolute tripe typical American rubbish.overrated.bad acting you name it was there.give me will hay any day.why people watch this trash ,i don't know.Marlon Brando,whats he talking about,he justs mumbles.give me a British actor anyday.let me sum up and say this is the worst film,i have ever seen.i hope to god i never see it again.i have been watching movies for thirty years and this is just the worst movie i have seen.it typifies what is wrong with the movie industry,when they can waste money on overblown claptrap such as this.if this is the best Hollywood can offer,god help us.lets just hope it was just a blipand Hollywood can again start making decent movies."
5067,False,"Honesly couldn't see what all the fuss is about. I felt this film lacked the very basics which make a good film. Good actors boring story and even worse directing!!! Perhaps this is because i only watched the movie for the first time recently, and therefore am comparing it to the standard set by todays writers, producers, and directors? I don't doubt it was a masterful production in its day but honestly the bar set by current movie makers really sees the 'God father' sorely outclassed. It is my conjecture that those who voted 9 and 10 out of ten did so because they remember how good it was in its hay-day instead of comparing it to all movies past and present before rating it."
5068,False,"Let me tell you first and foremost that I have viewed plenty mafia movies, not to mention I own several as well. The first thing I have to say about the Godfather that the entire plot is boring and drab, its almost as the Director is trying to make Americans fall in love with criminals,not to mention a bad display of Italian Americans were depicted in this film almost as insulting as Goodfellas. The question we must ask ourselves is""Are Italians really that thick headed and vulgar?"" and the answer is a resounding no. You almost get the impression that Vito Corleone is a homosexual and that James Canns Character has a mental diffieciency. The only good character depicted in the movie was Al Pacinos part. A man who wrestles with his own personal demons family loyalty and the straight and narrow life. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone and how it made number one is beyond me.The only emotion it evoked in me was anger although it helped me to fall asleep which I thank Francis for"
5069,False,"I liked this film and all, but does anyone really think this film is better than Lord of the Rings? Come on! It's surprising how many people supposedly ""love"" this film, yet can only put up the defense that it was well acted. A few mumblings here and there do not good acting make. And the attention to detail argument? ""It's so detailed - exactly as that era!"" So what? Lord of the Rings brought to life a FANTASY land, far more challenging than 1940's New York."
5070,False,"This film leaves one big question behind: Why the hell is it rated no.1 in IMDb?? There is no basic storyline, sometimes some people are being murdered but nobody knows why, you can't even say if the acting is good or bad because they run around with hats and sad faces all the time. From the beginning you simply sit there, waiting for some kind of message or at least some sense - and then after a much too long time the film is over. Why did they kill Don's friend? Why did they try to kill Don? Why did their enemies know that his son was driving to the husband of his sister? Where from did they know the one of the sons was in Italy? Why do they kill all the time at all? And where is the police I was wondering all the film. Lots and lots of murders, no police. Hm. It's nothing more than a bad 70's Mafia-trash-film."
5071,False,When I was in high school I took a cinema class and the teacher showed the Godfather I & II. I personally thought the movie was way too long and way too boring. There was just nothing entertaining about this movie not to me any way. If you like to watch movies about the mafia then this is the movie for you. I don't mind seeing a movie about the mafia and gangs if it is entertaining. When I was forced to watch the Godfather I & II in my cinema class I wish I had a pillow to put on my desk so that I could sleep. If you every have trouble getting to sleep at night just put the Godfather on and you will be asleep in no time.
5072,False,"Everyone raves about ""The Godfather"" and its achievements. I say it's all a matter of opinion. The performances are probably what makes this film a work of art. It'd be nearly impossible to find another film where Diane Keaton, Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, and the rest of the cast do work of such quality. Even in the sequel, they begin to slack off (with the exception of Keaton and Pacino). What this movie also benefits from is the power of the story, but there are moments where the overall mood becomes oppressive and a bit too slow.The film is a joy to behold, with an evocative score, sensational photography, and many other great elements. Would I put it up there at the top of the heap? There are other films that are more consistent, whose elements work well as a solid unit and deliver more satisfactory results."
5073,False,"I can't believe that I wasted my life on this crap. My dog, Sonny, died yesterday because I made him sit through this flaming pile of horse excrement. He ended up hijacking a semi and driving it into the Grand Canyon. I sniffed the T.V. while this was playing, and lemme tell you, it smelled like freaking' turds!!! If I ever saw this movie again, I would have to do things that will have me killed in every country to the filmmakers, actors, actresses, animals and trees associated with this rotten Indian food covered in bird feathers.Once, I had a drink of water. The water had a worm in it. I didn't know that at the time...Now back to the review.I missed that worm, he crawled out of me like that creature from the movie ""Alien"". The doctors said I was gonna die. I guess I showed them... They will learn the true meaning of suffering. They will feel the wrath of Bob the Worm!!!!!! Anyway, the Godfather killed my dog, so therefore, it sucks donkey poop. Peace, it sucks. 1/10"
5074,False,"This film is very stereotypical and as I am half Italian I feel I have the right to stick up for the crowds of real italians who find this film totally offensive and even boring. This kind of film can lead to racist attitudes in our society as it's portrayal of normal folk is completely over the top (OTT). Marlon Brando received many praises for his performance but there are too many inaccuracies too mention in his accent, never mind his mannerisms.I watched this film with my friend, his Italian wife and her parents who don't speak English, and get this!!! they fell asleep!!! The greatest movie of all time and they fell asleep!!. I managed to stay awake but it was hard but my friend loved it for some weird reason, but he's an oddball so he doesn't count.Certainly does not deserve to be numero one, instead may I suggest the princess bride, a classic tale of love and adventure."
5075,False,"I just don't get it. Sure the acting in some parts of the movie is good, but honestly, the entire ""angry Italian""-role is probably the easiest character to play. And i really don't get how every other character other then the ""angry Italian"" seems underdeveloped, plain boring and uninteresting. The only way for you to like this movie is by sympathize with the characters. And sympathizing with the bad guys (since almost every main character is a murderer and a mob member, even the protagonist is a bad guy)is difficult, although not impossible. If the director makes the evil sides of those characters redeemable, then it would be a lot easier for the viewer to sympathize and worry about the protagonist if he/she was in danger. When i however see Michael Corleone in danger in this movie, every time i wish for him to be killed, for i feel nothing for him. Which means that watching this movie was a waste of time. Although the soundtrack is quite good so instead of a rating of ""1"" The Godfather will receive a ""2"" out of generosity..."
5076,False,"This movie is like football, people only watch it because the think its 'cool' or 'popular', but really it is the most dreary repetitive and slow film i have had the displeasure in viewing.How this film grew to be such a ''great'' i do not know, bu ti know that it shouldn't be, Shawshank Redemption may not deserve to be second best film ever, but at least it is worthy of being where it is and is certainly a better film than any of the Godfathers.So please consider this when voting, the Godfather is poorly directed, badly scripted, crudely acted and most importantly is, quite frankly boring and wearisome."
5077,False,"I read a while back that ""The Godfather"" was a favorite book of an author I enjoy. I hence picked up a copy, and was enthralled. I had heard how great the movie was so I watched it, and I was appalled.I grant you, the movie follows the book closely, but it doesn't understand what makes the book work. Most of the actors know what to do, and Al Pacino is perfect, but Marlon Brando is clueless. Vito Corleone is NOT a thinly veiled thug. He is a caring man, who is forced to do some horrible things. But in the end he accomplishes far more good than evil. This only makes Micheal's transformation in the book more horrible, because the deaths he commits serve no such higher purpose.Also, scenes of great importance are removed, Johnny Fontane is barely in it, Santino's girlfriend has a cameo, and the Doctor is nowhere to be found. I know these character's don't directly effect the plot, but they give it an emotional foundation to build upon. I cared about them more than any of the other characters. I know Coppola had to cut the book down for time to do a movie, but he would have been better off doing a mini-series instead."
5078,False,"Either someone stuffed the ballot box on this one or people are merely voting for an icon without really thinking about it.  This movie does not even remotely deserve its reputation.  There is no significant character development; it is too long (and that's an understatement); and in quite a few places, the plot drags interminably."
5079,False,"OK, I REALLY don't get it. I always thought: ""Oh well, the Godfather, masterpiece, everyone has to watch it at least once in their live, let's see it then (someday)"". Then today I finally decided myself to watch it and I was shocked about it.To make it short, it was boring, WAY to long for the amount of real action (and I don't mean Micheal bay action, I mean something like a traceable storyline that doesn't introduce new names and character every time something really happens (and thats not often the case) so that in the end, you don't even know who's who and what is really happening. I don't like a film where you don't know who is doing the action you see, especially if some of the main characters are so similar that you can't distinguish them in some scenes. Also, the film is too long. Take the first set for example, the wedding (or was it a wedding?). If you count all the minutes you see some macaroni's dancing without sense or entertaining the viewer, I think it's around 5 to 10mins. If you look at that you know why the movie is around 3 hours long. Coming to the characters, I didn't have any emotional relationship to them after 3 hours of nearly non-stop conversation. I didn't really care when they died, first because in most cases, I didn't know who was killed in the scene most times and second, because I had no emotions for them. (Let's take that scene near the end, where all the people get killed, like 5 or 6 in three different locations. I didn't even recognize one of them, the whole scene didn't make sense for me. Why would they shoot a women with their child in the bed, especially if the viewer doesn't know who (the f**k) she is??? Not really a pro for a so-called ""masterpiece"") The only two pros I have are the acting and the music. I have to say I'm not a pro in commenting acting in films (watched Catwoman and didn't have a clue why Halle Berry became the golden raspberry for their acting after learning all that stuff with the walking like a cat, martial arts etc.). But I have to say what I've seen in this film is the most natural acting possible. None of the scenes looks contrived, the ""we are all family"" part came very good. Also the soundtrack is really worth recognizing.To sum it up:Acting: 10/10 Storyline: 4/10 (really disappointing) Action: 3/10 (even more disappointing) Lenght: 2/10 Soundtrack: 8/10Overall: Around 4-5/10, I'll give it 4 because it's overrated.PS: I watched ""The Rock"" the same day and found it much better than ""The Godfather"" (Better action, no lenghts, even better soundtrack, a very simple but at least traceable story)"
5080,False,"The Godfather... 3 Oscars... NONONONONONONONONO!!!!!!! This film (And its others) Is THE worst piece of rubbish i have ever endured!I feel that it was an insult to my backside who was forced to grow carbuncles under the weight of such mafia slush. the acting is terrible, the premise is horrible and the time is awful.They made more than 1? yes. were any of them good (and i'm not biased, i always watch things till the end to get a full view... i even watched the others although i hated it) no.. all awful, all too long, need i say more?My view -10/10"
5081,False,"I love the fact that the movie give us an insight in something we would, as ""normal"" people, never get the chance to know. It's a world full of traditions, family values, rich and explicit verbal and behavior language, but also a world of corruption, power, deceit and murder. Francis Ford Coppola knows how to create this Italian-American feeling throughout the whole movie, and it never feels superficial. It's a very good movie, but not extra-ordinary. I lack a bit of depth in the storyline like in the approach of the young son Michael being dragged into the world of the mafia. It was a bit too easy. He gets smacked in the face by a corrupt cop, and suddenly he wants to shoot everybody. I think I miss an essential scene between him and his father in the clinic. Anyway, trying to keep The Godfather on number feels a bit compulsory and bizarre. I think that this great movie needs to get away from this forced spotlight position, so we can appreciate the film without all this hype. And we shouldn't be blind to other great cinematic pearls being made in recent years."
5082,False,"A ponderously slow moving script interspersed with vulgar blood and guts scenes.  After about 20 minutes of this tripe I wanted to drop a bomb in the middle and wipe out the whole lot of them -- for the good of humanity.  With few exceptions (Pacino) the acting was also of low caliber.  All the money spent on the sets, costumes, and backdrops could not make up for the lack of any direction or purpose to the main storyline."
5083,False,"Everyone's saying this overrated film is one of ""the greatest films of all time"" - NOPE! I'm saying it's Groundhog Day!WHY?? Because that one is a GOOD film - with meaning, creativity, fun, likability, and enjoyment. Unlike this, it makes you WANT to do fun things like it features, when watching it. Watching ""the Godfather"", I feel, ""No, I don't want to do or watch these things"".Most of this film is rather just boring & confusing! Everything is shot in the dark (or with a dark filter); you have to make sure you've got something else to do while viewing this *masterpiece.* It's way too long. And it's certainly NOT ""flawless"" - I've spotted a WHOLE bunch of flaws with this flick, that they'd have to be put into many notes! Remember, no film is without flaws. A summary of the flaws with this film are confusing story lines, corrupt characters, crime, violence, some filthy language, bad attitudes, even the false cult of Catholicism being featured, rudeness, mind-aching distressing corrupt plot inconsistencies, or scenes that just don't make sense or just annoy the bazzerk out of you!I couldn't care less if almost all critics everywhere have given it glowing reviews, I don't care if it's generally considered a ""masterpiece"", and I don't care if it has a 9.2 out of 10 on IMDb. I can't believe I fell for such a deceiving look. I'm sad that they've refused to see how horrible it is. The fact is, films have quite the tendency to be either underrated or overrated these days. Seriously, this should be turned around! All the attention towards the ""Godfather"" series should be given instead towards ""Groundhog Day""; all the awards given to the ""Godfather"" series should be instead towards ""Groundhog Day"". It's THAT good! Please check it out!And plus, Marlon Brando's brought into this flick, and given one of the stupidest accents in film history; sounding so nauseated and drunk, with his chin thrust out so far, it makes me think he's turning into Jim Carrey. This film's also one of the biggest reasons why I don't care about Al Pacino as an actor; how he almost always seems to have a fetish for hardcore violence, swearing, and playing all-round unromantic, unpopular, and unlikable characters.Undoubtedly it was this flick that started a whole film career of mistakes for Al Pacino - I guess he's kind of cool, just not as much as people make him to be.Though to be fair, I do give credit to this film for not including one f-bomb at all.But overall, I think this is certainly one of the worser movies I have seen, and I'm GLAD I didn't watch it growing up.2/10PS: I'm a movie buff who tries to like every film I see."
5084,False,"When it comes to naming the greatest and most influential motion pictures of all time, Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterpiece ""The Godfather"" is a title that is practically guaranteed to be among the many listed. Famed director Stanley Kubrick called ""The Godfather"" a candidate for the best movie ever made and ""without a doubt, the best cast."" Although not very familiar with Kubrick's films and his tastes, I will say that on the second regard, he is absolutely correct.Based on a very good, hard-to-put-down novel by Italian American novelist Mario Puzo, the film revolves around a fictional 1940s Sicilian crime family based in New York. The family is run by a wispy-voiced, puffy-cheeked man named Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who has, for the most part, moved away from the days of violence in favor of peace and prosperity without blood and above all things, lectures on the topics of friendship and loyalty. When an attempt is made on Vito's life, his two sons (James Caan, Al Pacino) and his adoptive son (Robert Duvall) take control of his dynasty and fight to keep him alive and what unfolds is a repeat of days gone by and the world of the Mafia is exposed to a spellbound, absorbed audience.""The Godfather"" is nearly three hours in length and part of this is due to the fact that it follows Mario Puzo's novel almost exactly detail-by-detail, scene-by-scene: a very rare thing in Hollywood, which always seems more than happy to alter and reshape the mold of the authors' visions for the big screen. Coppola's film will without a doubt satisfy the purists, and even to those who have not had the privilege of reading Puzo's fantastic book, this is still a more than enjoyable way to spend three hours. Even at such a length, ""The Godfather"" never fails to keep our eyes focused on the screen.Number one, we have great characters in what is possibly the greatest cast ever assembled for a single movie. Marlon Brando was great; that was a given. But what really impressed the audiences of 1972, and what still impresses people, are the performances of the supporting cast. Names such as Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan, who are at icon status today, were nobodies at the time. Al Pacino, in particular, gives a noteworthy performance that garnered him an Academy Award nomination and made the producers who initially wanted to ban him from the role feel like the biggest idiots on the face of the planet. Pacino is undoubtedly the most ironic character in the film. When we first see him, he's not even so much as a sliver of a Mafia-type image. He's passive, he's quiet, shy, with a clean record, and a war hero. Then, when he has to assume a Family role to defend his father, he slowly turns into the image of his predecessor and by the time the film ends, Pacino is the exact opposite of how we first saw him. Of course I can't leave out Diane Keaton as Pacino's love interest, who watches him change before her eyes, James Caan as the fiery-tempered brother, Robert Duvall as the Family consiligere, and one of my favorites, Al Lettieri as the villainous, steely-eyed Virgil Sollozzo, who fits the exact image of how I pictured the character while reading the novel.Second, there is the fantastic element that the whole realm of the story takes place in the world of the Mafia. There is none of the tired old elements of, shall we say, detectives trying to uncover the Mafia and take them down or civilians who become victims of the organized crime families. With this method, we successfully connect with and understand the motivations of the characters while the outside world, law and otherwise, simply lies in the background. The outside world meant little to the Mafia, and thus it means little to us as well.But of course, ""The Godfather"" does not glorify the Mafia. Yes, we do identify and sometimes feel for the characters in this savage world, but never do we justify for them. And when director Francis Ford Coppola tries to give us horrifying violence, he delivers. As he noted in his commentary on the film, Coppola worked hard with his pyrotechnics crew to make all of the shootings and killings in ""The Godfather"" look real as opposed to making them obvious simulations. He uses blood, but not so much to the point where it becomes over the top, but just enough to make it convincing and disgusting.""The Godfather"" was an enormous hit when it was first released. It garnered there Academy Award wins included Best Picture of the Year and broke box office records that would not be topped until ""Jaws"" (1975) was released three years later. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were all secured nominations in the Best Supporting Actor category but surprisingly none of them won. It also spawned two successful sequels, one of which I feel is actually superior to the original. And now Francis Ford Coppola has worked with Robert A. Harris to restore his famous trilogy and give it the pristine print that he always wanted audiences to see it in. Among other films such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962), ""Vertigo"" (1958), and ""Spartacus"" (1960), ""The Godfather"" is certainly a film that deserves a beautiful restoration so that it may linger in our collective minds for generations to come."
5085,False,"'The Godfather (1972)' doesn't need an introduction, nor does it necessarily require a review. Nevertheless, I'm going to go on telling you what you already know: this is one of the great American films of the twentieth century. The 1970s was a landmark decade for Hollywood film-making, and Francis Ford Coppola was particularly productive, releasing the first two 'Godfather' films (1972 - 1974), 'The Conversation (1974)' and, perhaps his magnum opus, 'Apocalypse Now (1979).' This week I was fortunate enough to experience a cinema screening of 'The Godfather,' and this second viewing only inflated my respect for Coppola's achievement. On my initial viewing in 2006, I had been very impressed with the film, but also hopelessly lost for the most part. With literally dozens of speaking roles, and frequent allusions to otherwise unseen characters, the plot had left me stranded, just as 'The Big Sleep (1946)' always manages to do. Suddenly, however, much of it became clear to me; the characters' motivations, deceptions and emotions gently drifted into focus. This was stunning, complex cinema, the sort of bold film-making that puts most modern movies to shame.A notable artistic observation regarding 'The Godfather' is that Coppola's film-making style is strictly traditional. Whereas a new generation of filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin were introducing a gritty new cinema aesthetic, Gordon Willis' cinematography is graceful, understated and handsome, predating his excellent work for Woody Allen {the most notable example being 'Manhattan (1979)'}. A sprawling family saga, 'The Godfather' boasts a staggering ensemble cast of emerging and established actors, as well as many unknowns who nevertheless give letter-perfect performances. The scenes of violence are typically abrupt and effective, but much of the film's running-time is more closely concerned with dialogue and human interaction, particularly among family members. Needless to say, the quality of talent is more than enough to make these scenes, not only watchable, but astonishingly compelling. Every character down to the smallest speaking part ¬ñ and there are a lot of them ¬ñ has such a richly fleshed-out personality, making their actions and development throughout the film both authentic and interesting.Marlon Brando ¬ñ in what, along with 'Last Tango in Paris (1972),' was deemed a grand comeback ¬ñ gives a towering, Oscar-winning portrayal as Don Vito Corleone, the aging head of an Italian organised-crime family. Having endured decades of corruption and inter-family conflict, and seeing his household disintegrate in the futile pursuit of family honour, Vito finally understands in his final moments the folly of his wasted life, and the fateful mistakes that led to this undesirable lifestyle {these precursor years would be explored in greater depth, with Robert DeNiro in the role, in 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)'}. Most central to the story, however, is the transformation of youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who, in the course of the film, effectively sells his soul to retain that elusive ""family honour."" The climactic sequence, utilising Eisenstein's style of montage to its fullest extent, intercuts the baptism of Michael's nephew with the simultaneous assassination of the Corleone family's enemies. This scene also serves as a baptism of sorts for Michael, symbolising his irreversible initiation into a life of crime, and the final transaction of his soul."
5086,False,"In other words it is not the greatest film of all time. I cannot stand people who have claimed it to be. It is no where as a good as Shawshank, Alien and definitely is not, and never will be, as good as Taxi Driver. It does have its moments and Al Pacino was brilliant, (no I'm not going to give Marlon Brando a shout out, because he too is overrated) the music is stunning and so is the story but it isn't very catching I had to space the viewing over a number of days because I couldn't be arsed watching all at once without felling the urge to watch something else. It rises well but then falls flat on to its face then slowly makes it to it's knees towards the end. Yet I still find it hard to believe how it is the 'best' film ever.F.Nich"
5087,False,"I hate gangsters movies, but ""The godfather"" is a big exception.I always listen about ""The godfather"", and i always thought that it could be a lost of time. But, in a Sunday, i watch the film. At the marvelous and surprise ending, i say: I cant believe this movie exist.""The godfather"" talk about Don Corleone, and his blood. How his family enjoy, and the same time they suffer. Besides a great music, the interpretations are incredible.The violence is presented around the whole family, as if it a curse. This movie had a lot of good remembers, because is different story, a story of love, revenge, thrills and surprises.""The godfather"" is interesting because in each take, in each second it takes you to the drama of this family, and you suffer as them.Definitively, this it is a movie that has certain touch, because the story makes you give curiosity, because we don't know to where arrived this family with this risky business.*sorry, for bad words... well, if there any"
5088,False,"Yes. It's that good.This is one of the only films that I can watch, and still notice that detail more with each viewing. This is one of the only films I've watched that hasn't got one flaw. This is movie was the greatest film experience i've probably ever had (This and Scorsese's Goodfellas, Taxi Driver & Raging Bull). These reasons alone should get everyone who hasn't seen it, to see it. - Because you haven't lived until you've seen this film. Al Pacino is absolutely amazing. The greatest thing about the trilogy however, is Michael's eyes. Oh my god, especially in part II. It is amazing. WATCH IT.10/10"
5089,False,"This movie is probably the most overrated movies on IMDb, if not the most overrated. People on here are looking for too much out of movies and they aren't looking to judge them off of the right things. The movie was shot beautifully, the storyline is pretty interesting, but the movie is long, and dryly drags on and on. TO me the definition of a great movie is a movie that gets my different emotions running, whether it makes me laugh, cry, gets me excited etc. etc., this movie did nothing,I just sat there, I watched the movie, then I thought to myself, this movie is what people consider to be the best movie of all time. THe Best? H*** No, the best movie of all time should make my emotions run in everyway. I'm not saying its a bad movie, but its just not my idea of grade ""A"" entertainment. Definitely not number 1, before you bash me, just think about it."
5090,False,"The Godfather recognises the polar opposite to the American dream. It itself represents the ""dark side to the dream"" in a romanticised way using mise-en-scene and costume as well as Coppola's clever use of binary opposition with light and mood. The Godfather shows some clear morals also, such as the importance of family and patience. Loyalty is key and you find yourself, as with any good gangster film, becoming loyal to the characters, or the family introduced, in this case the Corleone's. Coppola's time frame is clear from the beginning, it is set with Micheal's army uniform from world war two, which allows a certain amount of historical l context to be conveyed without being explicit. Violence within this film is both implicit and explicit, you will view violent scenes and also know when violence is being implied. Which only adds to the beauty and the danger of the film.Many have said this film is slow moving and confusing, however to watch with a careful eye, which is must be viewed with, it displays a complex world to a naive viewer, sympathy is invoked carefully and somehow all crime committed within the film is seemingly justified with careful use of versimilitude."
5091,False,"This is probably the best mob movie of all time which captures the old mob dramatics of the 1920-30s with the more business savvy mobs of the 1950-60s. It links the classic capones with the modern gambinos.Al Pacino's finest silent work ever. With simple looks he envy's so much meaning. Brando at the best i have ever scene. The ensemble is absolutely amazing. This is the best of the 3, and miles above part 2 (which i like but don't think quite matches up this part 1 in anyway)If you haven't watched this, rent the DVD and watch it this weekend. If you have and don't have the DVD collection, buy it.IT is worth preserving this and having it in good quality."
5092,False,"The Godfather is a true classic. What differs this movie from others is the realism and that it's very believable. I thought 2 1/2 hour would be a long time, but time really flies when you're having fun! The movie follows the Carleone family, a good old Italian-American mafia family. The year is 1946 and the drug-market is just opening. When the Carleone refuses to take any part in this business some of the ones counting on this get's mad.The movie is based on the book by Mario Puzo. It's a well written movie. A smart thing to let Mario Puzo do the screenplay as he knows all the characters and the story inside and out. The story is not a simple one and there are quite a few characters. That might make the story confusing, but if you just pay attention you'll do fine. The characters and the combination of characters are great. We have a kind of anti-hero (Michael), the boss (Don Vito), the trigger happy (Sonny), the bystander (Hagen) and more. That gives plenty of opportunities for conflicts between them. The characters are very believable and you get to know them, what kind of persons they are. The story and action is also very good. You get caught up and dragged into another world. The dialog, witch is important to this movie is well written. It's not that typical movie where everyone knows what to say at any time. There are silence and thought-breaks, that makes it all more casual and normal.The actors are very good. The have settled for nothing less than quality actors in all roles. They use Italian-Americans and that makes it all more believable. Marlon Brando and does a good job and will forever be remembered as Don Carleone. Al Pachino's performance is nothing less than great. The rest of the cast are also very good an delivers a very good performance.The cinematography is classic. There are nothing really special about it, but it's all over good. The composition is good and the lightning is nice. They've captured the mood very well. It's not happy, it's not dark, it's something in between. There are no shots that stands out in a bad way, so you don't really pay attention to it. You just focus on the story.The sets, decoration and costumes are incredible. It's very realistic. It's 40's all the way, yet you don't really think about it. You never stop to think that ""this is the 40's"". It all just comes natural. It really helps you get caught up in the movie. Not once do you think ""why don't he just pick up a cell phone?"", because it all seem so realistic and well done.Nino Rota has made a forever memorable score. It's classic and easy to recognize. It makes a nice, kind of gloomy mood, and fits the rest of the movie perfect. I also like the lack of music. In the action scenes there are no music. This makes it more tense, personal and human.There are some special effects in this movies. Some blood, fights, shots and explosions, but it not that much. What there is is rather good. Some it has a little theatrical look to it and therefor I'm glad they didn't make a big deal out of it. The fact that they don't literally overkill and focus on this makes the story more serious and much more believable. This movie is no action movie, but 100% drama at it's finest.The Godfater is a classic, must-see movie for everyone. It has a special place in movie history. It almost a legend. If you like movies this is not a movie to miss. It's a little long, but don't let that scare you. My tip is to watch this movie when you're up to it. If you watch at the wrong time it'll destroy you impression of it, but when you get the chance, watch it!"
5093,False,"Marlon Brando is the Father of all actors when it comes to act as a don.The novel(which is also great) has been converted beautifully into a movie. Every detail has been taken care of.And what to say about Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), I became a fan f him after I watched the movie.The background score is too good. I was wondering whether i can get it from somewhere.All in all a great casting for the film.The best mafia movie i have ever seen. better than its following two parts."
5094,False,"The Godfather film is an excellent movie WHY? because of the drama, action and the loyalty.The movie describes how it could be in a mafia family, both on family problems and political problems. The Godfather also gives you a picture of how a man with respect could be as Michael Corleone and Vito Corleone.Alsow did the movie learned me something, that always love your family no matter what.The movie haves good actors as Al Pacino and Marlyn. not only that it haves also good actions and original scenes!"
5095,False,"Hollywood has some strange politics.  Note how Civil War movies tend to favor the Confederacy over the Union, and crime movies almost always favor crooks over cops.  Yet in real life, even if cops annoy us from time to time, I think we prefer them to murderers and thieves.  And even though the Confederacy has a romantic air attached to it, we're all glad that the Union won (the sane ones amongst us, anyhow).  Somehow, movies don't quite reflect what we actually think, and we often end up rooting for protagonists that we would hate in real life.All this build-up leads me to the doubtless controversial statement that I can't really warm to ""The Godfather"" because it's about a bunch of scuzzballs.  I can admire this movie, but I can't love it or relate to it in any way, except maybe as an allegory about the corrupting influence of power.  I can't relate to LOTR either, by the way, and I don't think either film deserves the title of ""bestest picture ever.""I actually think ""The Godfather: Part II"" is much better, as it's more concerned with family relationships (the ""human"" element) than the boring gangster-vs-gangster conflicts that predominate here.  And I have a theory that people confuse the first two Godfather films in their minds, combining the best elements of both into some kind of uber-picture that doesn't actually exist (people do the same thing with ""Star Wars,"" mistakenly remembering Yoda and ""Luke, I am your father"" as elements from the ""classic"" first film).  Most of the famous Godfather scenes are not here, but in the sequel. Here, we get Brando mumbling incoherently - the performance everyone makes fun of.I prefer ""Donnie Brasco"" because the character development is richer, and even ""A Bronx Tale"" because it has a powerful anti-gangster message, and because it meticulously recreates a specific time and neighborhood (as opposed to this film, which creates a gangster fantasy world).  But generally speaking, I'll take a straight drama - about people who aren't hit men - any day."
5096,False,"This film has everything - Great actors at the top of their game, a brilliant and realistic story, a top director, brilliant cinematography, wonderfully evocative post war costumes and cars, brilliant scenes (horses head, restaurant shooting scene, hospital scene etc.) and a score that adds to the film without overpowering it. At first look it would seem to be a film about a family of gangsters, but I think that what it really is is a story of how a good, intelligent man, a war hero, can become a monster by degrees. Godfather II is probably superior but it couldn't have been made without this film. A true masterpiece."
5097,False,"How this movie has to be #1 is a mystery, then I see that Lord of Rings is #5 and I understand. Just think people rated this movie #1 cause other did it. A kind of conformism. The story is completely non-sense. What's the deal in a mafia family's revenge? Good actors don't mean good movie, good director doesn't mean good movie. If the story lacks then direction and acting are worthless. This movie is BORING! There's no emotional scene in all movie, oh well if you except the horse in the bed. There's anyway some funny moments, as the way are pictured the mafia guys in Sicily, really outdated. Lol Make a favour to yourself, this movie is almost 3 hours long, add another hour and watch to ""Once upon a time in America"", a real epic tale on gangster. This Godfather was a big disappointment :("
5098,False,"The heavy storyline from ""The Godfather"" by Mario Puzo couldn't be better. The best acting performance you poissibly can reach, Marlon Brando does his greatest role ever as Vito. You really don't notice that the movie has some years on it's shoulders, stunning by Francis Ford Coppola. This one cannot be anything else than the highest score possible."
5099,False,"A young Turk is asked to take over the family business. The only problem is that business is a franchise of New York's Murder Inc.The bones of the original Godfather have been so raked over that there doesn't seem a lot left of the corpse to examine. I almost passed on it until I read some of the other reviews which miss so many important points.Yes, great acting (Brando as the old Don and the Pacino as the new will never get better parts). Yes, great directing (Francis Ford Coppola). Yes, a great musical score (Nino Rota). But, nevertheless it is a film that won't quite a settle in my own mind. The information we are given on screen, while believable, is only a selected view of organised crime. I might even argue that it is a cop-out view.I saw this film as a child and was, then, unable to stand back and examine it as a whole. I wanted the cheap bang-bang, the stripped suits and the violin cases. I was bored by the central theme and thought that watching it (for three hours!) was a bit of a chore. Even today it is a bit slow, but I am now an adult and I can see all the things I missed first time around, not all of which flatters.Not that the central theme passed me by: The corruption of the innocent and the rights of passage. How many other people - other than Mafia sons - are born with a destiny? Members of the royal family, sure, but who else? Offspring's of Frank Sinatra (perhaps referred to, obliquely, in this movie) and Elvis Presley haven't even entered show biz no matter tried to take their father's crown. To tell such a story there is few other places that Director Francis Ford Coppola could go but to the mob.Here you have it all: Wealth, politics, extreme violence, corporate problems, the psychology of power, double standards: The whole world of lies, truths and half-truths all together in one place. They say the devil has all the best tunes, but he has a few good film scripts in his locker too.Coppola was nervous as a kitten back then. He introduces the characters in a good light and tries to highlight the good before we see the other side (and often it is not lingered on). He knows full well the audience could be lost before it is won. So no medals for bravery. We see the wealth and power, in clear visuals, but we don't see where the money comes from. Where are the beatings, the robbery and the drug addictions that the mob perpetrate?  The bricks and mortar of the  Long Island mansion that we see before us.The family is not involved in drugs (and is against them) says the old Don at a ""sit down""? How do we know? Crime is freelance, the only role of the mob is protection  of its members which means a share of the money they earn out of direct sight.(You could say that this sight-unseen street crime puts the cotton wool in Marlon Brando's mouth!)Pornography and vice he doesn't have a problem with - although we don't see it and don't, in the main, care. Women are just another commodity ""that corporations cannot provide.""Killing seems to be sacred (a theme we see repeated in this series). Pacino doesn't have to kill (it wouldn't have been beyond his wits to have the job done by others) but does so. As a vengeful killer he is real deal - as a non killer he is the baby-faced ""college boy"".The film does little for women. They are all hand-wringers or professional lookers of the other way. Either that or victims. OK feminism wasn't around back then, but good actresses such as Talia Shire and Diane Keaton don't have a memorable line between them.Many of the faults of the first part were put right in the second. We see how power was taken (not given) through the barrel of a gun and some of the home truths that Godfather (Part One) tiptoes around. Nevertheless three hours is a lot of screen time not to have a few minutes to look at what these people leave behind - namely innocent victims..."
5100,False,"I agree that The Godfather is a classic and one of the greatest movies of all time but it bothers me how many people think it is absolutely perfect. It is not perfect, but it still probably deserves the number one spot. It is definitely the best mob movie ever made, but I don't like how people live and die by it."
5101,False,"The Godfather is not a bad movie. But no way in hell is it one of the Greatest movies of all time. It's not great at all. It's a decent movie, but it is absolutely overrated. It didn't even set any precedents or break new ground or anything. It's just a 3-hour long gangster movie with not interesting stuff happening. OVERRATED!!!!!!!"
5102,False,"The Godfather has to be one of the greatest movies ever. Ever.  Marlon Brando is Vito Corleone, the don of a mafia who was injured by a shooting of another mafia.  Al Pacino is Michael Corleone, a man who just got home and is ready to take over for his injured father and do the dirty work of repaying the other mafia.  James Caan is Sonny Corleone, a raging psychopath of the family who is also ready to take over for his father before an accident happens.  A big accident.  Francis Ford Coppola is the greatest director.  He created a true gem of a movie and I loved this every second. he proved he can direct wonderful movies and he started it here.  the acting was wonderful from everybody.  Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, etc. everybody was awesome.Overall this is one of the greatest movies of all time and I watch it all of the time.  Rating 11 out of 10.  (Tied for favorite movie)"
5103,False,"The Best Movie of All times, Al Pacino & Marlon Brando are Superb. Al Pacino as the son of the Godfather rules the second half of the movie with its excellent histronics and style. How The ruthless Michael conquers the underworld empire is perhaps the most significant tales of ever times. GodFather II equally good but III simply disappoints."
5104,False,"I just recently viewed the Godfather and while I find it an enjoyable movie, there is no way it deserves the #1 rank in the top 250 movies of all time. The plot is not that involved and the movie is a bit to long and drags in several scenes.  I found myself wondering when it was going to end and that is not the sign of a great movie."
5105,False,"""The Godfather"" is a 'terrible' film.It's 'the worst' movie I've seen in a decade. The acting in this film is 'excruciatingly painful'. The whole family are 'watered down Sopranos' who show some phenomenally strong 'lack of' chemistry. The 'boring' weeding scene is the 'highlight'.Michael is a 'wet fish' and his relationship with Kay is very dumb, and also 'stupid' and 'weird'. The Godfather scenes make me 'sick' and 'woozy'. I haven't seen such dramatized 'try to be cool' dialogue since ""Any Given Sunday"".Pacino was less wooden in ""Gigli"". That other film he also 'carried'. Both Puzo and Brest were largely let down thanks to this 'Tony Montana' The characters of Sonny and Fredo were so 'unrealistic' I thought they were 'comic book'. I must also highly criticize the music in this film as being 'childish' and sometimes often 'out of place'.Now on to some other failings of this 'pathetic' movie. The dialogue was 'silly'. If it was supposed to be nail-biting, well, it 'failed'. The manner in which the actors delivered their lines was 'uninspiring'. Brando in particular 'sucked'. What about the 'long' and 'tired' Sicily scenes? Reference to four hours of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" I don't know? The car exploding was so 'unoriginal' and 'clich√©d'. And the 'take over' cross baptism montage. Come on, do some CGI instead! Bah, 'armatures'.How this is ranked above that masterpiece ""Muriel's Wedding"" stumps me. If they had replaced the old and tired Francis Ford with the more youthful Nicolas they might have hit pay dirt."
5106,False,"The Godfather is a great movie and, in a series of three, the quality didn't diminish.  The second installment won the Oscar for best picture, and it deserved it.  However for those who read the book first, it is all familiar territory. Marlon Brando has only been better in ""On the Waterfront"" and Al Pacino has never been better, that is saying something.  The film is perfect, almost. The book is better than the film and rarely get's mentioned.  Emotion is there, but an age old stereotype get's enforced along the way.  Everything else is perfect and earns the honour of being a true classic.  The problem with the first installment, the second one was somehow better."
5107,False,"I was very disappointed in this film as so many people recommended this film as the greatest one ever created, it was no.1 in the IMDB chart so i rushed out and bought it only to find out that i have wasted ¬£12 on this very below average gangster film which went on for a full 3 hours!! if you want a decent gangster flick i would recommend either goodfellas or casino as the best in the genre !!"
5108,False,"What can I say?  I gave this thing a 1 because I honestly have never felt it was all that good.  I that saw the average was a 9  at the time I voted and I felt the dissenters should get some representation.  Brando isn't all that great in it.  I mean the thing is better than the average film (at least I'm supposed to believe that), but 9 out of 10!?  No way.  Watch different movies.  In fact, watch other coppala movies.  I personally like 'The Outsiders' and 'The Conversation' better.  I find the story to be boring. I also think the structure of the script is a little too gimicky and amateurish.  I won't go into detail on this.  I will just say the thing left me dry."
5109,False,"this movie was more boring than church! they just talked and talked they hardly ever shot anybody! Michael Corleone is a little girly man! and that Sonny guy, no one intimidating is named Sonny! when he got blown to bits, i laughed....hard! Then there's Vito! What's with this guy? Does he have marshmallows stuffed in his mouth? why does he look like that? and what's with that name...Vito? who names thier son after a presidential command! it could only be one typed of people, hillbillies. Italian Mafia hillbillies. If you want a real good movie go see Santa With Muscles! he'll stop them Corleones!               1 out of 10"
5110,False,"If you aren't a thug lover... if you don't drool over less than smart bad guys somehow getting ahead... if you don't really like spectacle just for spectacle sake... then this movie may not be for you. To me, it just epitomizes the big dumb knock people over the head with a club, speak like you dropped out of school in fourth grade sort of guy movie. I'm a guy. I like guy movies, but I don't like this one.Brando I like pretty well. Pacino too. Hell, probably half the cast I am very fond of. Why can't I like this movie? I don't know, but it has just never made me feel anything but annoyance and boredom. The problem is people over-hype it and make me want to try to like it. Every time I try to watch it, it's the same thing though.So sorry, this movie just isn't great."
5111,False,"This film tells the trajectory of the Corleone family and its leader, the ""godfather"" Don Vito Corleone. Rich, powerful and socially well-placed, this family leads one of the most important criminal cartels in New York, as one of the Mafia's ""five families"". Inadvertently drawn into a war with another family, the Corleone's will, throughout the film, showing their human side, as well as they will be able of the most cruel and vindictive acts.Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this film needs no introduction. It's the cinema adaptation of a novel by Mario Puzo, who collaborated in the writing of the script, which is one of the best scripts of twentieth century cinema. In addition to this director and this script, we should highlight the cast, full of stars (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and others) who gave us an ""offer we cannot refuse"": a masterpiece that anyone should watch at least once.If there is a movie where there is no possible negative note, is this: the suspense is permanent, the Nino Rota's soundtrack is unforgettable and even the light contributes to the heavy and gloomy atmosphere that makes us wait for the moment we'll hear the next gun shots. Winner of three Oscars (Best Picture, Best Leading Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay), five Golden Globes (Best Film, Best Leading Actor: Drama, Best Screenplay, Best Original Score and Best Director) and a BAFTA (Best Soundtrack), this film received several other nominations and awards and is considered by many the best gangsters movie ever, and one of the best films of the twentieth century. Those who love good cinema must see this film."
5112,False,"""The Godfather"" is a superb movie it is all about a Gangster family and their crimes fights story business and all it is one of the greatest movies ever made.The Direction done by ""Francis D Coppola"" is great and the acting done by ""Al Pacino"" and others were 100% Top notch.I watched this movie recently about a year ago and I had no words describe this MASTERPIECE at that time!!!Overall the movie was must watch and Top notch entertainment. It has got 9.2/10 rating on IMDb and 100% on Rotten tomatoes which is the greatest rating movie and it fully deserves it!!!!!"
5113,False,"Pretty much the best movie of all time. My favorite scene is the one in which John Cena body-slammed Michael Corleone. This scene is pivotal in movie history.

5114,False,"This film is an example of a great director, quality actors, outstanding script writing/ screen play and an amazing film score. I love it!My favorite scene:Don Corleone: Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? Bonasera: What do you want of me? Tell me anything, but do what I beg you to do. Don Corleone: What is that? ""Bonasera whispers his request in the Don's ear"" That I cannot do. Bonasera: I will give you anything you ask. Don Corleone: We've known each other many years, but this is the first time you ever came to me for counsel or for help. I can't remember the last time that you invited me to your house for a cup of coffee, even though my wife is godmother to your only child. But let's be frank here. You never wanted my friendship. And, uh, you were afraid to be in my debt. Bonasera: I didn't want to get into trouble.Don Corleone: I understand. You found paradise in America, you had a good trade, you made a good living. The police protected you and there were courts of law. And you didn't need a friend like me. But, uh, now you come to me, and you say: ""Don Corleone, give me justice."" But you don't ask with respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me Godfather. Instead, you come into my house on the day my daughter is to be married, and you ask me to do murder for money.Bonasera: I ask for justice. Don Corleone: That is not justice. Your daughter is still alive. Bonasera: Let them suffer then, as she suffers. How much shall I pay you? Don Corleone: Bonasera, Bonasera. What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If you'd come to me in friendship, then this scum that wounded your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if by chance an honest man like yourself should make enemies, then they would become my enemies. And then they would fear you. Bonasera: Be my friend ¬ñ Godfather.

5115,False,"Godfather amazing movie , i am 19 years old and i so much like this movie, with absolutely the best actor Marlon Brando ! Maybe i'm young but i know what quality and excellent movie . I think that never make movie like this , because this is the best movie ever. Amazing qutoes : ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" ""You sonofabitch, do you know who I am? I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders."" ""Whatya gonna do? Nice college boy, eh? Don't wanna get mixed up in the family business?

5116,False,"The Godfather is overflowing with life, rich with all the grand emotions and vital juices of existence, up to and including blood. To permit us a glimpse at The Mob, with all of its ethnic insularity, is like giving a chronic gambler a chance to wander above the false mirrors that overlook every casino. A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits. In its blending of new depth with an old genre, it becomes that rarity, a mass entertainment that is also great movie art. As filmmaking and storytelling, 'The Godfather' remains a bravura piece of work, its set pieces, dialogue and performances entrenched cinematic icons."
5117,False,"I know I will be in the minority with this review, but I think ""The Godfather"" and in particular Marlon Brando's performance are completely over rated. I'm not saying it's a bad movie at all, it's a good one, but I don't think it lives up to the hype.Plot In A Paragraph: The Godfather ""Don"" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs, and Vito refuses his permission or help. What follows is a clash between Vito's old values and the new ways which may cause his youngest son Micheal (Al Pacino) to do the thing he is most reluctant in doing, and join the family business.I found it to be over long and very drawn out. Sometimes a movie nearly three hours long, can feel like an hour and a half, as it is the engrossing and enjoyable the time flies by. This felt like I spent five hours watching it. With the exception of Brando, all the cast are superb. And I don't mean that as a slant at Brando, he does what Brando does. No more no less. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall are all excellent as is Talia Shire (in my second favourite role of hers, behind Adrian in ""Rocky"") and Diane Keaton. Ridiculously quotable, and still a movie I think everyone should see once. It's just over rated"
5118,False,"The only good thing about the movie was its style. It is unique. The second thing was Al Pacino, I mean he just holds everything still while he speaks. REally commendable performance. The opening scene was fantastic""I believe in America"" perfectly lit shot. After that everything is a drag. I get bored by the end of the movie. It has elongated scenes , I mean these so elongated that you can take a nap without missing anything. It was more like a opera kind of movie. So the opera lovers may like this movie but for me it was boring. Go watch it if you kind of love family drama said in a kind of some song and well love to nourish the scenes"
5119,False,"One of the most successful movies ever made in Hollywood. Inspired me to study acting since I was 19 years of age so hard and become an actor in my country, Colombia. Spectacular work of acting in actors like Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Michael Kane, Marlon Brandon and the whole cast. The crew had to be amazing to, in order to make such successful film. Bringing a tragic story from reality to the magic world of the movies, so many people can enjoy it. Today seems the time has not past and it is very pleasant to enjoy amazing acting performances of each actor and still learn from each peace of scene. It will never past away and will stay as a classic, hope it can be around for all new generations of actors, directors and producers. Wish some day I can share tables and set with great actors like them, who have been inspiring and example in my work and professional life as an actor. Thank you all."

5121,False,"There isn't much that I can say about The Godfather that hasn't been said a million times. A masterpiece, as close to a perfect film as you can get, arguably the best film ever made, ""a film you can't refuse,"" etc. Coming from a guy who's favorite films have mafia/gangster-related themes, The Godfather is the greatest film ever made in the history of U.S. cinema, in my slightly biased opinion.From the legendary music (beautiful work by Nino Rota), to the cast and the acting (Brando, Pacino, and Caan), to the cinematography (brilliantly done by Gordon Willis, aka ""The Prince of Darkness""), to the fascinating story and everything in between, there is nothing about this film that disappoints. It is one of those films that everyone should watch at least once in his or her lifetime, because the chances are that you will want to watch it again."
5122,False,"A GREAT MOVIE, one of the best film art ever, the actors are great especially Al Pacino that made there(in my opinion) his best performance of his career. this movie takes you inside the Italian mafia world in the US but more important, it takes you inside the Corleone family, it shows the the relationship between the father, Don Vito and his children, especially with Michael(Al Pacino). What makes this movie so fascinating is the way that Francis Ford Coppola(the director) make you to identify with the main characters - people who murder their enemies and live like they are above the law, he make you love and admire the bad guys - The Mafia. In conclusion, the godfather is one of the best movies I have ever seen and i recommend it to all the film lovers. for anothe reviews: http://www.imdb.com/user/ur44998795/?ref_=nb_usr_prof"
5123,False,"The Godfather is most peoples favorite movie of all time and that's fine. But for me their are better mob movies that explore the mafia. This movie is an epic such as Saving Private Ryan or Gladiator but it doesn't give you an emotional staying power like these films do. Be that as it may, I really enjoyed The Godfather because it makes the story of these characters believable. The three strong points of this movie are its story, you live this life with these characters and you don't doubt that they had to go through serious heartbreak and triumph throughout their lives. Another strong point is Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone. It is an iconic screen performance and has definitely been copied in later crime movies. It's such an original character. And then the last strong point is the writing, so many memorable quotes are from this film and as they should be. In action movies visual effects and stunt doubles make you feel good. In a great movie like this the action is the dialogue. An overall good movie but extremely slow."
5124,False,"I went into the Godfather expecting a masterpiece from all the reviews and how it number 2 or 3 on the IMDb top 250 films. After watching it I found it very disappointing for a few reasons. 1. You can't understand what the Godfather is saying half the time for the most part it all sounds like he's wheezing. If your going to watch this film put on subtitles.2. Its way to long. the movie is just shy of 3 hours long! Thats long enough and especially most of the time nothing is going on. I found myself not paying attention to most of the boring parts in the film and there's a lot. Now I know what your saying, your saying that i don't like long films. To you I say false i don't mind long films like the LOTR Return of the king is 4 hours + in the extended edition but there's a difference LOTR is entertaining there's action going on throughout 80% of the film. Now I'm not saying I hated the movie I'm justing saying it has a few flaws and its not perfect by any means. Now I have yet to see Part 2 maybe that will change my mind but right now it doesn't appeal to me because its 4 hours + long! All I can saying is that it better be more stuff going on in the movie then the first one.8.7/10 not a bad film but a few flaws"
5125,False,"I'll admit the movie at first was very boring, but after watching again, I fell in love with it. A movie that is really flawless. Incredible Story (I WON'T REVEAL ANY OF IT), Great Directing, Very Intense and deep scenes throughout the film, great music, the stage is very well set (this takes place in the 1940s, it was filmed in 1972 and it was almost as if it was filmed in the 1940s). And the most important of all is the acting, THIS MOVIE HAS PERHAPS THE GREATEST ACTING I HAVE EVER SEEN. To start, James Caan places as ""Sunny Corleone"", Robert Duvall as ""Tom Hagen"" (you may also know him from ""Apocalypse Now""), The Legendary Al Pacino as ""Michael Corleone"" puts up a hell of a show. And to top of it all was perhaps the Greatest Actor of All Time behind Humphrey Bogart: Marlon Brando as ""Vito Corleone"" Brando was the old actor, but still put up a great show starting a franchise that became one of the greatest films of all time. The film won Best Picture (despite being an R rated film), and Marlon Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor in Lead Role. I'd probably start a debate just saying it's the greatest film of all time, but I'm going to do it anyway, THIS IS THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME, everything is perfect in this film. You are not educated in Filmographically if you haven't seen this movie. If this movie didn't exist, the movies nowadays would be 100% different than what they are now. Period."
5126,False,"''The Godfather'' is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove.During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organized crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt.The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): ''Don't ever take sides against the family.'' It is significant that the first shot is inside a dark, shuttered room. It is the wedding day of Vito Corleone's daughter, and on such a day a Sicilian must grant any reasonable request. A man has come to ask for punishment for his daughter's rapist. Don Vito asks why he did not come to him immediately.''I went to the police, like a good American,'' the man says. The Godfather's reply will underpin the entire movie: ''Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If you'd come to me in friendship, then this scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if, by chance, an honest man like yourself should make enemies . . . then they would become my enemies. And then they would fear you.'' As the day continues, there are two more scenes in the Godfather's darkened study, intercut with scenes from the wedding outside. By the end of the wedding sequence, most of the main characters will have been introduced, and we will know essential things about their personalities. It is a virtuoso stretch of film-making: Coppola brings his large cast onstage so artfully that we are drawn at once into the Godfather's world.The screenplay of ''The Godfather'' follows no formulas except for the classic structure in which power passes between the generations. The writing is subtly constructed to set up events later in the film. Notice how the request by Johnny Fontane, the failing singer, pays off in the Hollywood scenes; how his tears set up the shocking moment when a mogul wakes up in bed with what is left of his racehorse. Notice how the undertaker is told ''someday, and that day may never come, I will ask a favor of you. . .'' and how when the day comes the favor is not violence (as in a conventional movie) but Don Vito's desire to spare his wife the sight of their son's maimed body. And notice how a woman's ''mistaken'' phone call sets up the trap in which Sonny (James Caan) is murdered: It's done so neatly that you have to think back through the events to figure it out."
5127,False,"Godfather is a one of a kind film. Nothing can ever beat this kind of story, with the Mafia and organized crime. Francis Ford Coppola just makes an amazing story like this come alive. It was made so that Francis could keep his studio running, Zoetrope, and probably didn't intend for it to be such a masterpiece it is. It's complete genius. Marlon Brando as the Godfather who gets a kiss on his hand and being told who should be killed, and getting lots of friendship from different people. Al Pacino, who is one of the most important actors of all time, is one of his sons, who is in the army, and not really into the family crime business unto soon enough. And other characters who make the Corleone family a one-in-a-million family, with astute heads. This is probably the, or probably one of my favorite movies of all time, just because it works, and is directed professionally, and perfectly. The acting puts a whole other atmosphere into this film. Watch it, and be sure to watch the second one also."
5128,False,"For my money the original Godfather is the greatest movie ever made. Compelling, legendary and timeless, with Marlon Brando coming out of retirement to blow the barn doors off the hinges with his portrayal of Vito Corleone, one of the most revered characters in movie history. He once again raises the bar on what a great actor can achieve and should be expected to. This movie began one of the most amazing movie careers in history with Al Pacino and also took America's guilty obsession with the ""ganster"" to new heights. It is a constant frustration for me when The Godfather II gets a higher rating then the predecessor. Also an all time great but there is likely no movie that deserves higher praise then this original ground-breaker. It has set a level of excellence for crime dramas that every movie since only strives to reach. The number of referenced and quoted scenes in modern Americana is matched only by Casablanca and thirty five years later it has still not faded in the memories of its audience.Logan Lamech www.eloquentbooks.com/LingeringPoets.html"
5129,False,"What i wanted to say has already been said countless times. Ill make this short. First off i love the Godfather. This is on my 10 favorite films of all time. We all know its top 3 material but when Steven Spielberg claims to have almost retired after seeing this movie because he feared that he could never make a movie of the same magnitude as the Godfather, thats saying something coming from arguably the best film maker of the last 25 years. I wanna say that this is the best film in history but thats really a matter of ones opinion and taste. Whether its better or worse than citizen Kane is your opinion, mine goes with the Godfather. Not that Citizen Kane is far off but what are we judging on here, The films impact, or the Film it self. Citizen is judged by its impact of every film that came after it. As a film it self, I don't feel it matches up to the Godfather nor gone with the wind or Schindlers list Given the difference in eras that they were all made. But hey, thats just me. Tons of Top directors believe that the Godfather is probably the greatest. M Night Shyamalan, Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick. Thats some good Company there. I believe the experts."
5130,False,"One realizes the importance of movies after watching this movie.Though paced slow , yet misses nothing. The movie tells the story not just of a mafioso but also of one of the strongest and most stable characters created -The GODFATHER. One of the most remarkable part of the movie is Al Pacino's acting. In the beginning he is a very cute person and you don't see any vice in him.Now, when things go bad for him ,you see him changing ,his eyes becoming dangerous.By the end of the movie he is entirely somebody else -The next GODFATHER. The theme music has a touch of negativity in it to depict the dark side of the Godfather but the Sicilian part has very soothing music also. The only drawback(if at all it is) is the pace of the movie which might seem slow compared to these days movie with so many cuts and pacing music,but if you have the patience to watch it, only then will you realize how great the movie is."
5131,False,"This movie has an answer for everyone. Don't know what that answer is watch again. Can't find an answer, dig deep.The hierarchy in human beings is reflected in many forms of our creation including religion, race, communities and nations. The order is established only when there is a leader (even in communism). Godfather and the other characters in the movie establish the order of human beings with balance of power (to lead, communicate and protect).This movie has presented the ideology of Godfather in a way that predicts human nature better than many other films. Those who cannot interpret/correlate this movie with their own lives, please see it again with that notion. Makes a world of difference."
5132,False,"I have been looking for a better film than this one for a long time, i have been looking for better acting, directing or writing but i haven't find it yet, not even the great geniuses of Bergman or Fellini have deliver us with such a masterpiece. Brando at his best, and the big appearances of such actors as Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Talia Shire and many others. The writing is superb, i've read the book, and together with the film they are both my favorites, and the directing is Coppola getting the whole essence of the honor, respect, devotion, love, desire and revenge. is totally illogical that two films like the dark knight or the The Shawshank Redemption (great films by the way) are better voted that this, the greatest masterpiece on cinematic history"
5133,False,"What is there to say about The Godfather? That it is one of the best movies ever we all already know. What makes me like it so much? It was the movie that got me interested in the Movie industry. The movie that touched me so much i immediately knew that I wanted to make movies. Without this movie my life wouldn't look like it does today. But it isn't just me that this movie has affected. The whole world loves it and hails it as one of the best movies ever. Some (including me) even ranks it as THE best movie ever.Based on the Novel by Mario Puzo The Godfather, after a lot of problems during the shooting, was released in 1972 and was a great success. It was nominated for 10 Oscars including Best director Francis Ford Coppola, best Costumes, Best Supporting Actor: Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Best Scrip based on previously published or produced material: Mario Puzo, Francis Ford Coppola, Best Leading Actor: Marlon Brando and Best Movie, and won the three last mentioned. The movie got 3 sequel's, one released in 1974 and one in 1990, both directed by Coppola and written by Puzo.The acting is superb, Brando does the performance of his life. Al Pacino, who got his breakthrough in this movie, together with James Caan and Robert Duvall make perfect supporting actors. For examples take a look at Pacino in the restaurant scene, Caan when he is arguing with Tom Hagen, or Duvall when he delivers a horrible message to his father played by Brando. The writing is amazing, it is true to the amazing novel, a lot of the dialogue is taken directly from it. The directing is perfect, he sets the perfect feeling and mood for the movie and it's a mystery that he didn't win the Oscar for his directing.To conclude the review.The Godfather is a true masterpiece that no-one should miss, maybe it will change your life the way it changed mine? It is in my Opinion The best Motion Picture ever created."
5134,False,"First of all this Movie contains a message and that is 'If you have the power use it your way'. An in the movie the director followed it perfectly. His work should be applauded What a movie!!! This is basically a movie on gangsters! and this has everything in the life on a don 'The Godfather'. This movie obviously deserves 10! Acotrs acted brilliantly, Story was brilliant, direction was awesome, It's just perfect! 'The Godfather' has everything to call it 'The Godfather' it has emotions, action, real life, romance everything is perfect in it! I am not amazed with the fact that it's no.1 in the world it should be! And by the way a film which which is this real should be no.1! The film has answered everything about a don's questions! You can use this film's message into your life and that is: 'If you have the power use it your way'"
5135,False,"Everything about The Godfather is brilliantly framed--well, almost. The depiction of Sicilian country life is, perhaps, a bit crass. Even so, its insular depiction of the world of Cosa Nostra was true enough to life to win the laud even of members of the criminal organisation.In the first place, ""The Godfather"" does an excellent job of weaving together the literal and metaphorical world of the mafia. Within the mafia, traditional institutions are given a warped, double meaning in which to frame illicit activity. For example, ""mafioso"" literally means, ""man of honour,"" but ""honour"" refers to a loyalty to an entirely different set of rules than those to which any Christian (or post-Christian) would consider even remotely acceptable. ""Famiglia,"" as used in Cosa Nostra, means a criminal corporation. ""Cristiano"" in the Sicilian tongue often designates not merely a Christian but any human being; to CN it signifies any ordinary man of honor. As for ""godfather,"" one mafioso standing godfather to another's son is often a formalisation of an illegal business pact.Puzo's and Coppola's Corleonesci, however, carry the double-edged sword of actually showing both meanings of these loaded words. The mafia family here IS a literal family; the men of honor, portrayed as they are in a closed word, CAN actually be viewed sympathetically as ""honourable."" (Of course in real life most mafiosi are literally Catholics {albeit sham Catholics}.) Here, the closed world so carefully guarded through layers of command in real life is given further immunity and legitimacy by actually being what it publicly claims to be--and so much more.Little needs to be said about the performances, which are by and large stellar; the casting of Al Pacino is of course a near sure sign that the film will succeed. Perhaps Diane Keaton may not be much to look at, but she does not play a major role in this installment. Neither do the cinematography, the score, the high-level tension, etc. ad infinitum, require further laud than has already been heaped upon this film. If you haven't seen it yet, you've probably been living under a rock. Immaculate taste and Latin sophistication await, all ye primitives..."
5136,False,"Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' is often voted amongst the best films of all time, but watching it today, it's surprising how conservative it feels. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, for, it's undoubtedly a piece of film-making of the highest class; but also a slow, stately epic that one could not imagine being made today in quite the same form (the contrast with Scorcese's 'Goodfellas', for example, shows clearly the direction in which film-making has evolved). On the other hand, to be fair to 'The Godfather', one must note how much it has influenced the gangster films that have succeeded it, perhaps making it seem more orthodox than it was at the time of its release (there are even stories that it influenced the real life mafia!). Of course, there's something conservative in the very idea of a gangster story, with its appeal to ideas of tradition and respect, even if the need for a plot means that such tales must inevitably focus on period when the traditional codes are breaking down (and the need for honesty must expose the extent to which they are a sham anyway). 'The Godfather' does both these things, in what is ultimately, behind the superficial subject matter, a story of personal transformation, that of Al Pacino's clean-cut college kid into the true successor of his mafioso father (played by Marlon Brando). The fact that this was arguably Brando's last great, complete, cinematic performance, as well as Pacino's first, has undoubtedly added to the movie's iconic status. Overall, I can't quite agree that this is the best movie ever: for all its sweep, it's a tale of people lacking a certain core of humanity, and therefore lacks the emotional intensity of my very favourite films. But it's still a mighty thing, worthy of its place in the cinematic canon."
5137,False,"We all know what a wonderful movie this is. I saw it on original release in the Netherlands on a weekday afternoon with perhaps 5 people in the theater...when Michael killed the cop and the gangster and walked out right before the intermission, you could hear everyone in the theater gasping from the relief of pent-up breath. The Godfather has one of the great goofs ever shown. In the scene where Sonny beats up Carlo on the street in front of Carlo's bookmaking operation, there's a shot of Sonny swinging a roundhouse right to the left of Carlo's face; you hear the impact on Carlo's face (nice Foley work), and Carlo's head is jerked to his right from that impact. It is all quite persuasive except for one thing: the camera was positioned directly to the side of the fight on a line at zero degrees of angle, and so you can clearly see Sonny's hand miss Carlo's face by at least 4 or 5 inches. A phantom punch! I get a kick out of this every time I watch the film."
5138,False,It is very difficult to talk about this film as a film. It is the beginning of in institution of gangSTAR films. Scarface has it going on but this is beautiful artisty combining actors that were Oscar winners and actors who went on to win Oscars! Al Pachino was incredible in depiction of a dark Amrerican come Sicillian... Marlon Brando was inspiring and I think made it very hard for Bob DeNero to measure up to. James Caan was very good and even the support characters were so well written and acted out it was brilliant! Along with this the music was also very good with the mix of Italian and American Swing. I loved it!
5139,False,"""The Godfather"" - it is incredible what resonance this name has.I am from a poor country where cinematography has just started to become part of our lives and i've always heard of this movie but never until now got to see it.Before viewing it i checked up on it to see what i should expect from it and i was mesmerized by all the comments and the praise it gets.I said to myself i shouldn't get my hopes high because I most probably will be disappointed after i see it.So i acquired it and i started viewing...after 20 minutes i had the ""one of those movies"" feeling.I like to ""live"" every movie i watch and entering in the Corleone family was the most incredible cinematic experience i have ever had.It is one of those movies that you just can't get your mind off even after 2 weeks since you've seen it...you keep reminding the characters and the sets and everything and you blend in creating scenarios in your head and feel the drama.The music is superb and every time i hear it i get chills up my spine and begin day dreaming.I am afraid to watch it again because maybe i will get the impression it's not that great but it will happen soon i think and i will relive it though first time you watch it you get the most shocking experience you can get.This is one of the few movies that will always remain in my head and that my soul will hang on to in the desperate wish that I will actually live for real an experience like this ( my intellect knows it will never happen but you just can't control these strong feelings)."
5140,False,"Best movie in my category. Brando's acting is magnitudes above any best actors in Hollywood and in any other world theaters. I suspect Brando's brilliance is unmatched by anyone before and (I suspect) after him. For example, Pacino is superb but still Brando is head and shoulders above Pacino. I just love Brando's acting, he simply grabs you and take you to anywhere the movie wants you to.But a good movie is not only a good actor. The whole cast, the plot, the dialogs, the scenes and last but not least the director - Coppola are all near perfect. I thank GOD for bringing such talent to Hollywood as Brando and Coppola. Al Pacino is good but under Brando's brilliance his color did fade away a bit.The supporting actor - Robert Duval is also a superb actor. Even in this cold and bloody killing movie he brings warmth of family friendship, loyalty and cool-headedness to the audience and making this movie this much more gripping.The weight of a first-class movie is apparent starting from the first few scenes of the movie and lasted throughout the movie. Coppola knows how to grab audiences and move them up and down through the plot of the movie - a true master.It is hard to compare Coppola with Lucas. They are both wonderful directors of different classes of movies. But I believe Coppola can better bring depth and intricate emotions to audience than Luca. This makes him a more memorable director even after we all pass on."
5141,False,"Let me start not with high praise, which is a regular sentence spoken on this movie. It is a motion-picture to discuss and yes there are elements in it that are extremely ambivalent. In the context of acting, directing and all the other formal aspects this is an exceptional achievement. I cannot think of too many others that can claim to have as polished dialogue and yet believable actors. But nevertheless the aspect of presenting a family-tragedy within a mafia-clan is at least to be consumed with your mind switched on. Coppola doesn't bother to present obvious critical points of view, but he presents the members of the Corleone-Clan as business-men. They react on their surroundings in the way it is necessary and to protect their family they don't bother to kill dozens of people. It is the contrast between the loving father and cold-blooded head of the clan, which attracts so many people to Brando's performance. He is so life-like on the one hand and yet manages to mute the  questionable traits of character that would paint Don Vito as a criminal. On the whole it can be said that this is still a movie which should polarize audiences, not least due to the growing influence of mafia like structures in many poor countries."
5142,False,"Being without doubt a quality movie (good plot, good acting, good directing) it is mysterious however why it is considered by many people to be the best ever made. The origin of this mystery needs some exploration. I think that technically the film is pretty well made although not without a flaw. I knew the great Nino Rota's melody long before I saw this movie and I was amazed how it was wasted in the film. Just an intermezzo??? And horribly performed...  I can suggest two reasons for the too high rating. 1. Americans adore their Mafia. And the film appeals to the desire of a simple man to imagine himself a deadly hero. That would explain also why it does not touch me too much. 2. The film was innovative in the time it appeared in manner I don't understand. Perhaps there were some cinematographic tricks that were revolutionary at the time and used in every other film since (that would explain why we do not see them). Godfather II impressed me much more because it goes against the first of the mentioned above reasons. No romanticism of the vengeance, no protection of the family any more. I think it was very courageous to show the bare face of Mafia in the country that adored it.  Deadly businessmen of the Godfather II are really horrifying. I cannot comment on suggestion number 2. But it any case that reason can have only historical significance.My rating for the film is 8 of 10."
5143,False,"Probably one of the best movies ever created. Acting, photography, soundtrack, everything is magnum opus material."
5144,False,"This almost flawless piece of art follows the Corleone family through their involvement in the mafia. It perfectly depicts both the business and family sides of life in the mafia. The only downside to the film is, that for someone not engaged in the history and depth of the story that is being told, it may come across as boring."
5145,False,"In my humble opinion, this film is one of the best films ever made! True masterpiece of cinematography!"

5155,False,This is by far one if not the greatest movie ever.
5156,False,"The first time I had seen ""The Goofather"" I thought that was just ""ok"" and ""good"", I think that my main issue was that the movie was ""too long"". Well, I passed the last 5 years thinking: ""Man, we saw that movie in the wrong way, this isn't possible"". And, yes, I was wrong, and yes, I had seen it wrong.The thing here is, I saw the movie a couple of days now, and I can't thing in a bad thing about it. Really, that isn't one think that seems misplaced or something. The script is fantastic, the movie had a lot time jumps, but you don't get confused, the actors are great (Marlon Brando and Al Pacino mainly), the photography is beautiful, and a lot other things. Well, I really think that isn't much to say here, there wasn't said yet. The Godfather is a real masterpiece."
5157,False,"The fact this movie is consistently called the best movie of all time absolutely baffles me. This isn't even remotely one of my favorite movies, in fact its one of the worst I've seen. Its 3 hours long, which is far too long, it's beyond boring and the story, or what little story there is makes no sense. I did not understand why anything happened throughout the whole movie, each death just happened for seemingly no reason out of the blue. Some of the actors mumble so much they are impossible to understand or speak in Italian without subtitles, which doesn't help in following along with what's happening. This movie does not deserve the extreme high praise it has received, not by a long shot. Its single redeeming factor to me is the excellent cinematography for its time, I'll give it that."
5158,False,"But Oldman also sinks deeply and empathically into Churchill's lower ebbs, projecting a sagging, load-bearing frailty and eloquence-sapping indecision we less readily associate with this semi- mythical figure. As foreign secretary Viscount Halifax (Dillane, once more compelling as a grey, rigid man of power) politically manoeuvres against him, we see Churchill flag and flounder. Not only is it impressive evidence of Oldman's dynamism and flexibility as an actor, it's also a timely reminder that world leaders should pause,"
5159,False,"Film Review: ""The Godfather"" (1972)The year is 1947, New York State, USA, the character of Vito ""Don"" Corleone, portrayed by actor Marlon Brando in a signature-defining role, listens to a man, who seeks justice for his abused and raped daughter. In a long camera movement (dolly-out) of the man's face into Don Corleone's Over-The-Shoulder shot (OTS), who sits in a shot-out room of golden-brown color forces in high contrast cinematography of light and shadow with no depth-of-field by Gordon Willis (1931-2014). Seven minutes later, we receive visual message of that day's occasion outside the insider-job-delegating office. It is the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter, performed by actress Talia Shire as Connie Corleone.The production design immediately suggests the contrast between the celebration of life in the exteriors and the prison cell-like war room of Don Corleone's study with transcendence of space with no-windows at all, where even family members know half the truth of what is set in motion by ""The Godfather"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola, at the age of 32, with an deep comprehension of his subject matter due to first hand collaboration at the writer's bureau together with initial author Mario Puzo of the equally-titled novel from 1969. Only selected people entered that bureau at times of the screenplay reception, including uncredited executive producer Robert Evans, as Paramount Pictures representative, and the film's producer Albert S. Ruddy, who trusted the young director as far as visual story-telling and character shaping. Nevertheless Coppola eventually could break away to direct and produce ""The Godfather: Part II"" on his own, reaching an even higher sophistication of cinematic story-telling with portraying two time zone with Michael Corleone's present state of affairs and the rise of young Vito Corleone, portrayed by actor Robert De Niro.At running time 0h 34mins 15sec the main plot thickens toward Don Corleone's last efforts of business expansion. His offer comes from a rivalling family tribe under the character of Sollozzo, which wants to convince Don Corleone to enter an emerging market of Narcotics. The declining gesture of this new business engages the suspense levels of picture, when shootings, the killing commences to full extent of character life-changing proportions, where the young and innocent take charge out of passion for tradition as emotionally twisted character of Michael Corleone, portrayed by deep-connected and camera-engaging actor Al Pacino, who crystallizes the essence of a family man's life foretold, inevitable put to action at running time 1h 05mins 00sec, taking care for family members surrounding him already building bridges to all-time famous Louis Restaurant scene, where he encounters Vito Corleone's nemesis in shape of the character of Sollozo with actor Al Lietteri (1928-1975) spreading the ultimate hostilities onto the silver screen by also owning the New York's police captain McCluskey, given face by no less danger-beating actor Sterling Hayden (1916-1986).The non-stop gripping plot shares decisive character signatures as so in the eldest son of the Corleone Clan, Sonny Corleone, portrayed by James Caan as the out-going fun-loving, extroverted type to take the family business as constant gamble, which his character needs to confront at an ambushing shoot-out at an highway toll station, before Michael Corleone gets to be Don Corleone's successor in all family affairs, stepping also over older brother Fredo Corleone, who has been performed to the utmost fragility by actor John Cazale (1935-1978) by missing to shoot his gun in attacking scene on Don Corleone's life, which eventually finds his high-tension conclusion in relations between brothers in ""The Godfather: Part II"", while Michael builds a new home away from New York to Nevada, USA as Vito Corleone retreats with his grandson into the residence's orchard garden.Director Francis Ford Coppola and writer Mario Puzo interweaves all characters in the picture to such extent that by the end that there are no loose ends in the story. Family lawyer Tom Hagen, performed by close-to-perfection beating actor Robert Duvall, stays close to Michael Corleone as with Vito Corleone before, when Michael's wife, portrayed by actress Diane Keaton, must witness her husband's transformation to become Don Corleone for the decades to come.¬© 2017 Felix Alexander Dausend (Cinemajesty Entertainments LLC)"
5160,False,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable."
5161,False,"Actually for lovers of the movies ""Mafiosos"" without a doubt the Godfather ""The GodFather"" is the only movie of all time, if you like the story, drama, suspense and action the godfather without a doubt is the best movie of all time in this category, I recommend it Widely, do not hesitate a second to look for it or rent it, without a doubt ... it will be worth it, enjoy!"

5163,False,"This movie series is a lot inspiring to explain the world we are leaving in. It's Such an inspiration source! Directed as genius Actors where Good, Marlon Brando has his colors as usual it one of my best source of motivation. Thanks for having produce this master piece. Wrote for the knowledge of generations coming. Instructive, also mysterious, the action is closed to reality, just a bit more stunts would be better :), but why change a perfect classic art. This movie is like an old wine that get better from years to years. Someday, my objective is to create a Montreal peace of art like this reminding our society."
5164,False,"Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well- made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint."
5165,False,"I cannot tell you how damn LONG I've been waiting to finally see this movie! It's taken multiple excuse-less years of avoidance for me to finally muster up the time and energy to consume this delight and, now that I've finally seen it, I'm happy to say that it IS indeed a brilliant, powerful, and borderline perfect masterpiece!I viewed this film in its restored edition on a crisp, beautiful blu-ray disc and, honestly, that's probably the best way to watch this movie. Try and find the most visually pleasing copy of the film you can find and just sit back, relax, and watch! The cinematography is truly gorgeous, and probably some fraction of what makes this film so memorable and beloved to this very day. Every shot is a painting within itself...mundane actions now take on this otherworldly elegance only seen in the finest novels and most stunning works of art. Just staring at this film makes it well worth the three hour length.The performances are also all spectacular, largely because of how fantastic the cast is. We all know about Marlon Brando's Oscar- winning performance, and how breathtaking that beautiful monologue of his towards the end is, as well as the fine acting efforts done by Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and (in a much smaller role) the great Sterling Hayden, not to mention wonderful supporting performances from Abe Vigoda, John Cazale, Richard S. Castellano, and Talia Shire, among plenty others. Nearly every scene is engaging and gripping, and the three hours are quite quick and the overall film flows like a steady stream of neverending goodness...there isn't much else to say about this one. While I may not think it is ""the greatest movie of all time"" as some others like to label, it is still a damn good (scratch that, I mean GREAT) one, and must be seen by all!"
5166,False,"""THE GODFATHER"" is the best movie of all time because this movie got the most splendid crew. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, Francis Ford Coppola (Director), Mario Puzo the author of the book ""The Godfather"" on which the movie is based on, Nino Rota (composer). This is a TRUE MAFIA FAMILY drama movie. Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of Italian art cinema, THE GODFATHER is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 30 years after its release. Nino Rota's score, the sumptuous set design, and Pacino's raspy pseudo- whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory."
5167,False,"The 1st installment of Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather is considered by many to by in the top 50 films of all time. It has everything you want in a all time classic, with exceptional acting from the likes of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan and Robert Duvall. Mario Puzo's classic novel adaption delivers one of the few adaptations of a book that's better then the book itself. With perfect soundtrack, perfect dialogue and perfect acting, Francis Ford Coppola delivers one of the best films you will ever see in cinema history."
5168,False,"All I can say is that after almost fifty years there still is not a better movie showing how the true old school way of the Italian mob at its best could not have been any better Actor or Actresses to play all the parts in this movie. I have seen all the Mob, gangster or movies having to do with these types of setting like Goodfellas, Scarface, Billy Bath Gate to name a few and nothing comes close. a true Homerun and for sure a MUST SEE!"
5169,False,one of the most beautiful works of art. Francis Ford Coppola surpassed all the boundaries of old cinema and delivered an innovative vision of the Italian mafia showing us the value of loyalty and the pain of betrayal. we can see an incredible version of Marlon Brando as the Godfather and Al Pacino as the son who is confused and we can see him corrupt himself and accept his destiny.
5170,False,"When best Thechnisians meet best artist the result will be GOD FATHER ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE WATCHED IN MY LIFE. The way story was narrated given goose bumps,the way characters narrated was extraordinary Dialouges of the film was quite interesting when you look for the best to watch you cant get more than this Watch and enjoy Well written,Well directed,Well acted"
5171,False,"i saw more gangster movie but all are based on this movie. himself is not even the central character in the drama. he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II"
5172,False,"I actually have never seen the classic movie and was really impressed and understand why it holds the status that it does in American Cinema. The locations and set were beautiful and spot on with the theme. I thought everybody looked like they belonged perfectly. The legendary scene with Don Corleone where he is in his office on the day of his daughter's wedding. The lighting and shadows in that is really impressive. Another one of my favorites that show how a movie can take you on a journey. Forget about what's going on for a couple of hours. When Michael was in the bathroom of the restaurant and the train was passing by and you see him searching for his pistol. I think this is a great example of great cinematography, acting and writing all coming together to create a larger than life scene. Being in a theatre it emphasized everything by a ton. You could hear the train as if you are sitting in that restaurant. Notice all the lighting and shadows I was really impressed!"
5173,False,"It is certainly one of the best films ever made in the movies, it really is a shame that it is difficult to produce movies these days. with such an engaging story. I miss the Mafia-themed movies nowadays, it would be nice to write about how the Mafia acts today in the world because it is a little explored theme nowadays."
5174,False,I rarely deserve ten points for both dialogues and events I do not think you can watch movies Vito my father Allah mercy so tenth place and place their designs are so good that they go to Michael's Sicily Congratulations on how well I met you Mario Puzo I congratulate you on making a very successful production

5177,False,"THIS MOVIE IS A WORK OF ART. Everything in this is perfect: perfect direction, perfect script, perfect actors, perfect music, perfect photography, it's just perfect. With this film it was discovered Al Pacino who makes an incredible character. I also think it's one of the most realistic movies I've seen since it's based on the Italian mafia and a character is constantly dying, more than one death can make you cry. And it's realistic because unfortunately that happens in reality. What else can I say about this movie: it is simply PERFECT."
5178,False,"I love this movie. I discover something new every time I have seen it.if you have watched The Godfather than you have witnessed what can be called the greatest movie of all time! This film represents the absolute perfection, either in cinematography or acting. The directing by Coppola was perfect as well.For me, there will be no movie like Godfather. Godfather is something you just can't hate."
5179,False,This is a great film. It was wonderfully directed and shot and the storyline is amazing. I wanted to be more sarcastic than this review but that's OK. If you haven't watched it please do it'll probably change you're life like idk maybe you'll decide to be a mob boss right after if so go for it live your life k bye
5180,False,"The Godfather is on a league of its own, giving a raw insight into the mafia world, this film will go down as the G.O.A.T! it is easily everybody's ""desert island"" pick.The godfather is filled with the perfect amount of:Action Drama Comedy and romance, it truly ticks all the boxes for any film fanatic."
5181,False,"Perhaps the single greatest movie I have ever seen. I was a student back then at Arizona State and I had heard about it from others shortly after it was released. At first after seeing it for the 1st time I thought the Don was wicked....then after seeing it several times he was actually protecting his loved ones even though he was in criminal activities yet many of his moves were handing out needed justice that the courts did not provide his fellow Italians with in NY. I saw the strong family values in him yet it was hard for me to realize his was a dark career. He created his own empire from zero having got off the boat all by himself as a very young boy after watching his family murdered in Italy, but what he saw from that was what raw power could do for a person from what that Italian Don had done to his own family. I think it internally made him gain same type of absolute power yet try to use it with fairness in family and related situations. He was not a wild cut throat Don.....there was honor in his power and we all could see it. Wonderful movie of an immigrant coming to America all alone and with perseverance and actual self preservation rise to power his people and lead them through then American tough times for most. He not only won the battle....he won the war as he saw it."
5182,False,"A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits.Of the many themes which The Godfather touches upon, it is that of ""family"" which resonates the most. The film is based upon the novel by Mario Puzo (who co-wrote the screenplay) and many sub-plots were minimized or thrown away by director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola, himself an Italian American and family man. He knew that the only way to make Puzo's sprawling novel work on screen was to focus on the familial relationships within this crime story, whether it be father to son, brother to brother, or husband to wife. In this world blood is not only thicker than water, it is holy.MMR Top 150 banner Coppola opens the films with an interesting shot of a pitch black screen giving way to a desperate figure, an undertaker pleading to Mafioso patriarch Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) to revenge the savage beating of his daughter. It is the wedding day of the lone Corleone daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request, which Don Vito takes on with reason, while also subtlety enforcing his position as a man to be respected and feared.Brando's casting was a coup for Coppola, for three reasons. First, it exhibited the brilliance and innovation of Brando's thespian prowess, creating a wholly new mafia figure within a world of stereotype. Second, it re-established Brando's standing as a major player after years of being labeled ""box-office poison"". And third, it points to Brando's influence as ""godfather"" to a generation of actors, many which play his children in this film.Plot wise, The Godfather begins with the attempted assassination of Don Vito from a rival crime family unhappy with his refusal to enter the narcotics trade. With the Don temporarily out of the picture, it is up to his sons to run the Corleone clan. There is hot tempered Sonny (James Caan), meek mild Fredo (John Cazale), adopted son of Irish ancestry Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and the fiercely independent Michael (Al Pacino).It would be Michael who comes through as successor, and as a result The Godfather is as much Pacino's film as it is Brando's, introducing himself with a revelation of a performance."
5183,False,"""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"". Simply stated, but it's a line that echoes far beyond the screen, and deep into film legend. 'The Godfather' is often touted as the greatest film of all time, and it's easy to understand why. Francis Ford Coppola, out of his depth for much of the production, has undoubtedly filmed more than just a movie, but a timeless portrayal into the heart and soul of a powerful mafia crime family. The Corleone family, headed by Don Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando, has risen to the top of the mafia pecking order in New York by not only by associating the family with politicians, but by strong family values kept in check with an iron fist. Just like politic's, a lot happens behind closed doors in the the world of a crime family, but unlike politic's, the consequences are much more severe. Not only did 'The Godfather' revitalize Marlon Brando's slumbering career, it put another's on the map. Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone, the Don's youngest and seemingly innocent son who has shown little desire to follow in his fathers footsteps. Pacino, who's status as one of the great actors has grown profoundly since his starting role, was a mere theater actor from NewYork and relatively unknown in Hollywood circles. But as the story grows and we see the Corleone clan come under threat from rival mafia families, Michael demonstrates through sheer strategy and cunningness the gusto to become the Corleone family top dog. While crime is the focal point of the film, violence is never far behind as we see the kind of ruthfullness required to reign in the criminal underworld. It's the little things that make 'The Godfather' the film it is though. The pasta sauce lesson from a Corleone family henchman, the cat in the study during the daughters wedding, all give the audience foresight into Coppola's grand detail and vision. 'The Godfather' with a scale of rich fullness rarely seen in films as brutal, not only holds the mantle of greatest mob movie of all time, but is also hailed as a turning point in the history of American cinema."
5184,False,"Best mafia movie to date. Everything from the performance of the stellar cast, to the direction, the writing, the producing, and even location... a timeless classic! Much respect to the filmmakers, cast, and crew involved in creating this cinema great! I wonder at times if there will ever another great mafia/mob film like this and if so in what era and which filmmaker will achieve in creating that world. Only time will tell."
5185,False,"The Godfather (1972) is a Classic Crime Drama about an organized crime dynasty ran by Don Vito Corleone played by Marlon Bando and his goals to pass down the family business to his reluctant son, Michael played by Al Pacino. This feature has aged so incredibly well that you won't even feel like you are watching a movie from the 70s. The Godfather is a beautiful work of art. The acting in the film, the detailed and complex plot, and the editing are among the highlights of the movie.The acting is magnificent and will have you quoting the main characters for the rest of the week. The movie begins with Don Vito Corleone in his office during his daughter's wedding. One of the first things that you will notice is that Don Vito has a very strong accent which suggests his character was not born in America. He is a strong man with strengths and weaknesses which he is able to convey from the beginning.The plot is amazing. Although this film is over 3 hours long, there are no dull or boring parts. The dialogue is short and sweet and to the point. There are definitely some moments that had me screaming at the TV and some other moments that made me very sad. Each character has pros and cons which makes them authentic and works to drive the plot into the direction that it is supposed to go.The editing is great. You can tell that the editor really enjoyed and believed in the film because of the scenes that he chose and where he placed them. This movie follows a chronological order so that you can easily follow along with the plot and there are not any scenes that I think should not have been included. Unlike some films where something happens in full detail and then they explain it to another party in full detail, this is not an occurrence in this film.I would recommend anyone who is a fan of crime, dramas, or just classic movies, in general, to give this movie a watch because it was executed to perfection. The movie contains many themes that would not be suitable for children so I would recommend this film for audiences of at least 13, depending on maturity. I tried to come up with criticism for this film, but it proved to be very hard. Never a dull moment, I enjoyed this feature from start to finish. The Godfather does an excellent job of portraying a powerful mob family with many conflicts that the average person will relate to, and some that no normal person could relate to. Watch as the characters struggle with the choice to act violently in order to protect the ones they love, and the choice to make peace with enemies to reduce the likelihood of a war. The acting, the casting, the screenplay, the dialogue and the editing are all excellent and tie the film together into a work of art, an absolute masterpiece!"
5186,False,"The general synopsis of this film without making a huge SPOILER is that there are a bunch of gangsters who are trying to take over NYC. They have a lot of fights between themselves and they end up in lots of tension. The tension is so real that you'll have to brace yourself and have REGULAR intermissions to take an emotional break from the violence. The ONLY spoiler I will reveal is that, let me tell you, you're in for a wild ride. If you are into gore, this is a wonderful, wonderful feature length film and I would highly recommend it. Especially if you are into the classic varieties of films like myself, the ones from the era of transition into color televisions that allow for a much more real and vivid experience!"
5187,False,"*** This review may contain spoilers *** This series,does not have Â∞∑Â∞¨ silence.If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the ÊúÄÈáçË¶ÅÁöÑ thing you can do before watching is to forget all of the greatest film . The Godfather is one my favorite films of all time."
5188,False,"One pretty legit movie.I watched this movie so late. I found out something that this film is a base for lot of movies. Marlon Brando's acting is outstanding, his accent man!! got me like this üòê he killed it. while he saying ""you don't call me godfather"" aha!! god i'm down. Al Pacino he too smashed his acting, still got to watch part 2 and get surprised."
5189,False,the film is very good the script is good every moment in the film is interesting and all series the god father is cool and learning some thing. this film made is 1972 that why i m very impressed and congrats the all team the god father film very intelligently play and really script is good my salute to writer who believe in the film every second .so i m so glad to watch this movie and watching again and learning some different.

5191,False,"Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, ""The Godfather"" is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. With performances, style and substance to savor, this shows how it is possible to smash box office records without being mindless. This is a world where emotional ties are strong, loyalties are somewhat more flexible at times, and tempers are short."
5192,False,"One of the best movies i have ever watched. it is a mix of pest performers, a great technical team and a clear vision of a film maker. which i think is missing in the world of green screens and a senseless screen plays of today. i often see people saying that this film is all about underground and mafia but i personally feel it is not only about Mafia done and power play but it is all about human emotions and how it will weaken or give energy to a human to grow or may be fall off."
5193,False,"I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him."
5194,False,"This is a brilliant film. This has absolutely no flaw. The story is narrated perfectly and the thrill grows with each scene. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino have played their roles so perfectly that you end up mesmerized by their act. A Textbook for all actors, writers and directors."
5195,False,"How is it possible for a gangster film to bring a tear to one's eye?I've lost count of the number of times I've watched this film, although every time it leaves me overwhelmed. The first thing which makes this film, for me, is the music; its genuine authenticity, being scored by a genuine Italian maestro, is unmistakable which, together with its stunning cinematography, gives the film its true and honest character. Beyond this, the storyline is excellent, although it does help to watch the film more than once given the extensive character list. On top of this, the cast is simply outstanding, each perfectly suited and giving clear distinction and definition to their character and each delivering a performance which they have surely not surpassed in their respective careers. It is easy to single out Pacino, Brando and Caan as the standout performances, each of which are excellent, however the supporting roles are equally impressive and go beyond support, sharing the intricacies of each character, their inter- relationships and their moral struggles in the face of organised crime and family values.Without wanting to give anything away, the closing scene is, in my opinion, one of the best moments in cinema.Quite simply, this is not a ""gangster film"". It is a masterpiece which needs no categorisation, it needs just to be enjoyed."
5196,False,"A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits.Brando's casting was a coup for Coppola, for three reasons.

5197,False,This movie really broke the ice on mafia movies loved ever second of it. Power house cast cant stop watching. I hope to one day play in a classic like this and I'm sure I will. So many moments i couldn't move just had to sit eyes clued to TV. Epic movie. I can watch it a million times and not get tired.
5198,False,"The screen writing and cinematography are absolutely incredible for their time and still is today. The way the movie flows just works and the characters have such well, thought out backgrounds and how they interact with each other. Between the protagonist and antagonists of the story plot, it all just worked out well."
5199,False,honestly one of the most boring movies I've ever seen! i would've enjoyed it more if it was shorter. i really don't get how its one of the most talked about movies of all time. i rated it 5 after watching but i'm giving it a 3 now. and i'm pretty sure i'm never gonna complete the second and third films.
5200,False,"Mindblowing piece of masterpiece. It can't be much better. Perfect cast ,excellent acting. Everything was perfect about this movie. Thats why we say it one of the greatest movies of all time. They all nailed it. These type of movies come only once in a while. Hats off. I am just dowmloading part 2 and going to watch it soon. I don't think this type of movie wwill ever be made again. Even 10 points are less for this movie."
5201,False,"Yesterday, I was lucky to be able to watch 175 minutes of pure movie magic, restored and at a big screen, thanks to Cnema in Norrk√∂ping.The pros: The incredible attention to detail in this impressively well-written and directed film. The iconic characters and intrigues that have since been the model for so many mafia movies. The brilliant acting from great Marlon Brando. The music by composer Nino Rota that is now almost more famous than the movie itself. The cons: Marlon Brando is dead and Francis Ford Coppola haven't reached this level of mastery again since ""Apocalypse Now"" in 1979."
5202,False,"A wonderful film. I love the history, the actors, the director etc. This is one of the most wonderful movies of all time. One of my favorites. I believe that script, photography and direction are sensational. The effect The light and dark of the photo is fantastic. The talent of the actors is impressive."
5203,False,"Science fiction has been used as an indication of what the future may hold. At times, it was promising a utopian future, where scientific inventions and developments will make life so much better for ""humans"", and machines (robots or, more generally, artificial intelligence) will be doing all the hard work. In other cases, however, it held a dystopian future, a warning message: technology can, and will, go wrong, and it will backfire, making our future full of destruction and agony."
5204,False,"RELEASED IN 1972 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather"" stars Marlon Brando as the aging don of an Italian mafia dynasty in the 1940s who decides to transfer control of his clandestine empire to his hesitant but formidable son, Michael (Al Pacino); meanwhile a gangster war breaks out between the five Mob families in the New York City area.MAIN CAST: James Caan plays the tough son, Sonny; Robert Duvall plays the adopted lawyer son, Tom; and John Cazale plays the weakest Corleone son, Fredo, who's basically exiled to Vegas. Diane Keaton & Simonetta Stefanelli play Michael's American and Sicilian babes respectively. Talia Shire appears as the ""hysterical"" sister of the Corleone family, Connie, and Gianni Russo her duplicitous, abusive husband. Al Martino plays Johnny Fontane, the singer of dubious talents inspired by Frank Sinatra.I'm not big on gangster flicks because it's hard to work up compassion for protagonists who are criminal scum. I usually can't wait for them to be wiped off the face of the earth (or sent to prison for life, sharing a cell with Bubba). But, if you can handle this element, ""The Godfather"" is a great Mobster movie and one of the greatest gangster flicks ever. This is basically a drama with flashes of brutal, shocking hoodlum-oriented violence.Highlights abound, starting with Brando's great performance, well displayed in the opening scene, and the awesome mid-40s ambiance. The restaurant sequence is suspense at finest. Other great scenes include the Beverly Hills horse bit; a rugged henchman unexpectedly garroted; Michael's rescue of his father at a deserted hospital (which is reminiscent of a similar sequence in 1968's ""Bullitt""); the assassination in the reeds; the brief-but-potent ""love at first sight"" moment in Sicily; Sonny's beating the snot out of a deserving POS; the sudden explosive death of a loved one; the unexpected tollbooth sequence; Vito playing with his grandson in the garden with an orange peel in his mouth; and the baptism sequence juxtaposed with Michael's men carrying out their wicked deeds.What's the moral of the story? The ending tells all: Choosing a life in league with organized crime will turn you into a hypocritical, lying, murderous fool.THE FILM RUNS 2 hours & 55 minutes and was shot in the New York City area; Sicily; Las Vegas; and Beverly Hills, California. WRITERS: Coppola & Mario Puzo from Puzo's book.GRADE: A"
5205,False,"The Godfather is a very intense viewing experience. I really liked how they used the bottom lighting so he could not really see who was talking at the beginning, it left a sense of suspense about it. The suspense of what could this person's business be what is there business what do they do. Why are they coming to the Godfather for help? The other thing I really like about the film is how before he goes to get the gun from the bathroom to shoot the men in the restaurant. When he gets to the bathroom he takes the gun and has to calm himself down, then he goes to shoot the guys and hears the sound of a train right before he does it. I feel that the intensity of the train noise rising as he is about to shoot them was a brilliant choice of thing to do because it shows how he is thinking about it. I do not like how they used low lighting all the time. I get it is a dark type of movie but it does not need that type of lighting like all the time. They could have used neutral lighting because that is not light but not dark at the same time. I feel like that would have worked better because low lighting ended up making the scene look way darker than it had to be. The Godfather was a very good movie and overall it was a very nice movie with an amazing story-line. The way they portrayed most of it was amazing but when they overused some of the lighting is what made me kinda feel off about how some parts of the movie may not be that great. I did like a lot of the sounds in his head."
5206,False,"A perfect gem in the movie history, a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The Godfather portrays inner world of the Italian mafia - there are no fancy moments, no glittering hysterics of gangsters it shines from the creeks of the kitchen and dining room, impressive performances, timeless lighting and engrossing editing makes this a masterpiece, A must watch for all the movie buffs."
5207,False,"Heard a lot about this movie but i was not interested in watching this movie since it is a gangster movie and there would not be much of a story but then i watched the trilogy and was by blown away by the performances and the screenplay,this is truly the greatest gangster movie ever made,that is the reason it is still remembered even after 45 years and this has been adapted by various filmmakers"
5208,False,"About the only thing I remember when it comes to being introduced to this movie was with my oldest brother bringing in a box of movies that he didn't watch anymore. It turns out that one of them was this flawless work of art that we know as ""The Godfather."" Often imitated, never duplicated, you cannot go wrong with this. After watching it once, you just have to watch it again. The writing is crisp, the acting is excellent, and the music will hook you in without fail. ""The Godfather"" is pretty much a staple with my family, particularly with me and my middle brother. My mom loves it just the same and would recommend it to anyone. As my title states (and as anyone else may say as well), this is truly one of the best movies ever made. Period. You cannot put any other movie against it whatsoever. It won't work. Watch ""The Godfather"" once and then watch it again. It will give just about every other mafia movie a run for its money...and then some."
5209,False,"This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from every cast member is standalone, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family and carries the power a mafia head should possess. James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons, with polar ideology but equivalent love for the family. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time you hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get a Metascore of 100 and it is. It was one of the movies which defined the crime genre or to say the gangster genre.The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best- selling novel of the same name. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to a ruthless mafia boss."
5210,False,I think this film one of my exciting films that i seen before. The main idea of this film was great. I saw this film 3 times in one day and it blows me away .I saw all the works of this director .the story was so lovely.I can remember it all day and i think about it a lot.that was flawless.
5211,False,"This movie is the greatest film of all time. Well this is my s so gripping you can watch it over and over, it's long and you won't get bored, at anytime. I've watched this movie so many times I can give only a average of over 100 times I have see it, from the characters to sets, oh and the screen play is magnificent. Great movie ever made, mind you I don't like remakes but if they do please be sure to not destroy a classic. Thank you to all."
5212,False,"Movie is all awesome and having a many good scenes which are also so much impressing, where ever other are just making the same thing and going or repeating again and again but this is what I call movie. Even every single is having a good quality of new moves and that makes your movie different from other creations. Keep going on and bring us a lots of good innovative ideas."
5213,False,"Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable.The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. The direction of this film was great! Frances Fran Coppela really knows how to make a great film.The cast of this movie was a good example of cast chemistry.The Writing was awesome.I don't know if it is the greatest movie ever but it is definitely the most iconic film ever made."
5214,False,The best movie I have ever watched! I have watched it for the first time in Feb 2017 and could not stop myself from watching the sequels at a stretch. All of the 3 parts are very amazing. I liked the second part better where michael transforms into a don due to circumstances and he nails it. The first part is like foundation without which the second part would not have been that perfect. Everything is so flawlessly presented that I felt like I was living the story. This (Godfather series)tops my list anytime.
5215,False,"The Godfather is without a doubt, one of cinema's most adored pieces of celluloid in history and is loved by universally everyone. Without question, it is indeed fantastic in every sense of the word and with this one, it may be completely justified to believe all the hype. The story centers on a young Al Pacino as the youngest son of an Italian-American mafia family headed by the great Marlon Brando in arguably his most iconic role. As things take a nasty turn for the family in relation to other competing mafia families, Michael (Al Pacino) gradually plummets his way into the dark and unforgiving world of crime. While the film is an adaptation of the book by the same name written by Mario Puzo, rest assured this picture has a flare entirely of its own. Thanks for Francis Ford Coppola, we're treated to a perfectly crafted story with incredible characters, breathtaking performances, and beautiful story-telling.First thing to note about the performances: every member of this fully-loaded cast of talent is on top of their game and if you've seen any of these actors at the peak of their powers, prepare to see it all at once. What makes the atmosphere so immersive besides brilliant performing is also an iconic musical score that you'll remember for years. Much like the bleak yet humanizing tone of the film, the score portrays a somber and harrowing theme of crime, revenge, murder, yet contrasted with very human emotions like regret, grief, and genuine sorrow. The Godfather has also become famous for it's unique cinematography provided by Gordon Willis. Every shot feels like a beautiful and dark painting that speaks volumes to the characters and their tragic journeys to the point of no return. Cinematically, The Godfather is outstanding and quite frankly, perfect. Any gripes with the film would find some minor plot details that felt irrelevant to the story or any major character arcs. Minor flaws aside, this film is truly one of the greatest movies ever made and personally the most memorable modern tragedy. It's one everyone should see no matter who you are because it's an unforgettable experience."
5216,False,"What can I say? This is easily one of the greatest movies ever made. Not just because the acting and everything is on point, but because Brando pushes it over the edge. There is no argument about it, Marlon Brando is the greatest actor of all time, and not just because of what he does in this film but for nearly every film he has been in. And his later films are all the better because at that point, he more or less mastered his craft. But yeah, The Godfather is an excellent film. The secret behind it, other than Brando's acting is the story. It isn't a crime story but a tale about a family; most people can not wrap their heads around such a concept."
5217,False,Best movie i've ever saw in my life. I was in school where my schoolmates told me about this movie and i was so excited to see what is about it and when i get home i watch it online and was the best experience in my life. Hope these guys will make more parts because this move was excellent.
5218,False,"A master piece by Francis Ford Coppola and screenplay is fab. keep inspiring us and new film makers. The story writer put all inputs to bind the audience throughout the film. Cinematography and shots are well designed and executed by the makers. I watched this 5 times, first it was in my syllabus and then i loved it."
5219,False,"The Godfather is one of the most iconic films in cinema history. There are three points in the film that made it stand alone: direction, acting, and writing. The Godfather is one my favorite films of all time. I would recommend you see this movie. It's awesome.This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well."
5220,False,"This is one of the best movies ever. A lot of powerful men. Also great actors who play in this movie. This a movie I can watch over and over again. I recommend this movie. Although the movie is about gangsters, there's still a lesson to be learned from this movie. There is a price to pay for being a criminal. Every good dog has its good and bad days."
5221,False,"This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same."
5222,False,"The Godfather in my opinion is one of the best and well produced movie I've seen. I've seen it many times and it always feel like it's the first time watching. It's an excellent film to watch by yourself or with friends (movie night). You're certainly in for a treat if it's going to be your first time watching The Godfather. It's long and I suggest turning your phone off. It's just shy of 3 hours, but it's so good that it will feel like 10 minutes."
5223,False,This is been excellent and favorite movie all the time. Mr. Francis done really a great in the history of cinematography. First opening scene has revealed the outstanding performance of Mr. Marlon Brando. Al Pacino was absolutely amazing in his young age. This movie set the dimension of a underworld trend setter movie.
5224,False,"Such a script, scenario and acting, especially for that day and age this is a must seen movie.Apart from the culturistic lean towards this movie with the help of the trends, this movie is easily the best no matter from which angle you look.Gold piece.Stay nice & be humble, thanks for reading..."
5225,False,"Just the best movie of all time. Performances,dialogues,shots,camera work,sound, just everything is perfect about this movie. Marlon Brando's iconic performance as Don Vito Corleone a.k.a ""The Godfather"" is a gem to this world of cinema. Both The Godfather 1 and The Godfather 2 are equally good in my opinion but cannot say the same about The Godfather 3."
5226,False,"From start to end, you are constantly reminded that you are watching one of the greatest movies ever made. The acting (especially Brando), the directing, the production design, and the cinematography are all top notch. It's long, gripping, thought-provoking - truly an epic in every form."
5227,False,"Either you like it or you don't get attracted. There is no way between the two interests.Personal opinion: must-see film which presents the world of mafia(s) quite realistic.Besides that, actors' performances are more than awesome."
5228,False,"While the plot of this movie is amazing, star cast is outstanding, cinematography and background music are masterpieces in themselves - the part which I like the most about this movie is how perfectly it depicts the influence of the cultural during those days over the society. The fine and minute details of lavishing lives of these underworld mafias, suppression of even elite women in almost every class of society and a lot more is put forth by this movie. The movie is full of twists and holds on to the audience. Your adrenaline level can be fairly high during these three and a half hours of your live. A must watch."
5229,False,"Shows powerful men's life. Its not just a movie for quickies. careful watching gives you glimpses of handling creatures of emotion and fear. its not exaggerated. But it is generally applicable in civilized society when leaders have emerged. Another interesting thing is usage of sound. A lot of sound and scenes are composed without dialogues. Light, silhouette, symbols of shadows are heavily used to 'frame' godfather. even you can hear a lot of family sounds without meant for any literal communication to the audience. baby cry, Italian conversations.. Bit lengthy and dialogue oriented. Only watch when you have peaceful time."
5230,False,"I like Mafia movies, I think Scarface and Goodfellas, two masterpiece, but The Godfather was never much of my taste, I find the movies very good, but not him and 2 are not movies that would speak that are better than the story , The initial scene of the film is excellent, has heavy moments, excellent dialogues, a very good script, the direction of Coppola is great, the truth is that Coppola is an excellent director, unfortunately he made more bad movies than good, the cast Is great, Al Pacino at the beginning of his movie boom, and Marlon Brando does one of the best performances of all time, from an excellent character that is Don Corleone, I think the film is very big, so the rhythm falls a little , The soundtrack is excellent, the photography is very good, The Godfather is an excellent film, even if I do not find a masterpiece, its quality and contribution to the cinema is undeniable. Note 8.7"
5231,False,"It was very good.At the beginning it seems to be passion of heart and later transfigures into a drama Alfred Hitchcock tried to establish. Suspense and excitement, the old film noir and modern crime.Representing a journey that you will never forget. Mario puzos novel was greatly applied by Brando,Pacino and the whole cast.Likedit sincerely.Motivated me to be a film lover."
5232,False,"This film is absolutely Brilliant in EVERY respect!! Characterization, Story, Plot, Script, Cinematography, Acting. The Godfather is a True cinematic Masterpiece. Bravo!If there are any holes, weaknesses or inconsistencies, I have yet to discover them. I've watched it at least 8-10 times and it blows me away every single viewing. GF2 was excellent, but not nearly as tightly written, several holes in the story that simply don't add it, but still a great film in it's own right. GF3 - very underrated indeed."
5233,False,"The son of a Mafia boss returns from the war and following an attempt on his father's life becomes more and more embroiled in the shadowy world of organized crime. Francis Ford Coppola's classic gangster saga is the story of a criminal dynasty headed by Marlon Brando in one of his most iconic roles. Coppola's direction is deceptively simple in that he uses no gimmicks or stylistic tricks; he merely allows the story to unfold and lets the superb cast do their thing. Brando's mumbling family and loyalty obsessed don has since become part of popular culture folklore (along with the classic score) and all other accompanying performances are top notch, from James Caan's hot headed Santino to Robert Duval's purely business orientated adviser. But this film is really the story of Michael's transition from honest war hero to shadowy underworld figure, played by Al Pacino in his finest role. The pivotal scene in which his newborn godson is baptized while Michael himself, the newborn ""Godfather"", is baptized in blood is an all time great. This is the birth of the modern gangster film and with the possible exception of Goodfellas, it is still to be surpassed."
5234,False,"Easily the best movie i have ever seen. It is just peferct, the entire movie made me speechless. Perfet acting, perfect writing and perfect directing. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando gave us some of the best acting of all time, along with the genius directing of Francis ford Coppola. An instant master piece."
5235,False,"The film, the godfather of Francis Ford Coppola, is one of the most accomplished film creations of all time. It is not only the montage of the same, also the plot, costume, interpretation of the actors, and the intrinsic message that contains. The film is timeless, it does not matter in the year that was made, because at any time is a reference of a well-done story and good cinema. The subject of the mafia always intrigues, everyone wants to know about it regardless of what they consider, whether it is good or bad, because they are well-planned organizations in which discipline, and respect for the word do functional. The godfather collects all these elements, jointly by the love for the family, and not only the family of the home, but family is the whole organization. This film must always be a paradigm of exquisite cinema. The godfather is one of the best films of all time.Cirilo J. Guzman"
5236,False,"Wonderful movie. It made me feel special just from the first minute till the end. After movie I wondered if I can do something like these guys did - thefts, kidnappings and all that kind of dirty stuff. The film perfectly conveys the atmosphere - dark and ominous New York, and a sunny, but mysterious Italy. Top rated move."
5237,False,"The best movie of all time. Excellent acting and directing. When I first watch this movie I couldn't watch any other movie for long time, because all of others were crap. I can watch it for 100 times, but I will watch it for 101 time. People who doesn't like action movies, crime or mafia would love this movie, too. Just need to write this and tell everyone to watch this masterpiece."
5238,False,"Watching this classic in a theater only solidifies it's place as my #1 all-time favorite film.Not a false note in the film. The setting is superb, the mood is subtle and effective, the music adds to the feelings.But the acting...oh, the acting!Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Casales, Keaton, Vigoda all at the top of their games.But...Brando...on another level entirely as Don Vito Corleone. A performance for the ages.Bravo...everyone...Bravo!"
5239,False,"Without a doubt, one of the greatest films ever made. Way beyond its time, it ticks the list of what every film should be looking to achieve if they want to make a great film. Undeniably, a classic and will never become something you find boring to watch. When people tell me they didn't like it because it was too long, I feel like never talking to them again. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, two of the greatest actors to have ever lived. And a score to stick with you until the end. A classic for the ages."
5240,False,"The Godfather is the best work of F.F. Coppola and the best mafia movie that you can find, the actors, music, atmosphere, decoration, script, everything in this movie is great and unforgettable! so if you still haven't watched the movie, you should grab your popcorn and get ready to 3 hours of pleasure!"
5241,False,"I like the presentation, I think I saw this long time ago, but I really can afford anything because I have born at 1994, I love my parent talk about this, good theme, trama, and the sequence go a story about this character than know how to be very godfather without limitations and not suppose to be a like him at non sense but I loved his performance."
5242,False,"Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, THE GODFATHER is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 30 years after its release. Nino Rota's score, the sumptuous set design, and Brando's raspy pseudo-whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory.The film possesses an operatic quality, yet it's more understated than it is flamboyant. It takes its subjects seriously, bestowing legitimacy upon the internecine power struggles of the Mafia normally reserved for classical themes in high art. The film's release initiated a period when American filmmakers dared to take themselves and their artistic ambitions seriously (perhaps too seriously). There is something deeply resonant in the film's treatment of filial piety, the need for respect, and our culture's abiding interest in the parallel moral universe of the Mafia."
5243,False,"This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film before... but I realized one day when my one of my friend brought DVD's then i saw God father title. And well' we watch them together w/ some other friends and then..This movie for me is an epitome of perfection, it scores a perfect score in almost all the departments, be it direction, acting, music, screenplay, character development, cinematography etc. I just couldn't find a fault with it (and mind you I tried really hard).With a blazing canon of actors which include Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall this film pierces right through you and makes a place for itself. Even days after you watch this movie you will find yourself, in your own private moments, speaking out those wonderful lines, trying to copy Vito Corleone or shape your voice like Michael Corleone. In its own mysterious ways the movie will sure remain with you.It leaves you wanting more, not because there are questions that remain unanswered, but because this film feels so good that you never want to leave it, leave the streets of New York or the Godfather's mansion."
5244,False,"It is one of the best books and movie that i read and watch. I've read them to learn something from them, to learn how to live in the broadest sense of the term, and there were books which offered me support. I agree with other reviews, this movie also has great Gifs. Most watch and read."

5246,False,"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best- selling novel of the same name. It stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone, focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.For me this movie best movie i see it ."
5247,False,"This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on a lot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family.This is definitely a ""must see"" masterpiece."
5248,False,The Godfather Trilogy is a classic combination which connects and represents the living Visible lovely Golden Era of Fame and Glory of 1972.The Godfather of the Corleone Mafia Family showing the complexities of that time of the MAFIA .The mafia is represented to be an Organized Crime Family which is Represented in the AfterWar of WWII .Showing what Mafia Figment of things happened in Families of New York.**************THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BEST CLASSICS EVER************
5249,False,"Godfather script portrays the duality of man: good vs evil, law abiding vs crime, loyalty vs betrayal, logic vs emotions, etc. It also warns of the long term consequences of our actions despite our short term intents and factors driving us to a certain path, which in the protagonist life, is crime."
5250,False,"THE MOST LARGEST FILM THAT COME BACK IN THE CINEMA HISTORY THIS PRINCIPAL WRITTEN MAKES A BOOK OF 1000 QUALIFICATIONS THIS IS NOT A POINTS THAT CAN BE GIVEN ON THE WORLD NATURALISM IN NATURE IN THE INDOOR AIR, Of course it is one of the masterpieces, the masterpiece of the father's film is that the curiosity and the mafia within everybody keeps going on the film in a way that will never break you from the film. Father 1 and father 1 after father 2 in the movie before the father is a father of mafia tells the state. In 3, he tells about his father's life after himself. Alpacino is Alpacino in the film Baba is a film. After Dad's film, he's already taken the wounded face. But many people who know father film do not know wounded film. A wounded face is one of the films that can try a masterpiece among mafia movies in the movie. The point based on the film was the point of importance to the family. How much a man is a father of mafia, there is a family that should look after him. The Godfather, the leader of many mafia leaders, has also opened a new style among the mafia. The Carlin family, which determined an image that would never be destroyed, has entered into legendary films with the father film. The Godfather is adapted from the same book by Mario Puzo. In the film, we will observe the developments around an Italian mafia family living in America, and we will get to know them closely. Michael Corleone, the family's youngest son, who joined the army to get away from her business, who is opposed to her father, takes on the job she does not love to save them from the difficult situation her family falls into. It is not only about getting to work, but it is able to get over all the responsibilities"
5251,False,"In the beginning of the film the characters reveal the life they lives.This is not the most interesting part of the film but we need it to see the big picture. After that the amazing story is reveal herself. When yo're a son of a big mafia boss you don't want to be like your father but when he is kill'd by ""the other mafia family"" the story is turn 180 for Michael. Hi respond to them by revenge like it or not this is the beginning of the war for the family's. If you live like this and you are surround by Italians Mafia and very bad gays that want to kill you or other member of your family you will protect them at any cost. Even if you don't want to kill anybody but it is necessary. Many people will say this is not the way to resolve a problems but if you have big money and many guns, why not? The Film has old fashion stile and every time i watch the film i want to be there. For some reasons the film is not like any other films, just like you read a new book and you want to read it all at once to the last page. You don't want to stop for any second and to watch it to the end. Yes the film is long 3 hours but how many films with that duration you don't sleep after the second hour. This is the film that after 3 hours you will wanted to watched't again to be sure that you don't mist anything. Even the film is back at 1972, Coppola just set the work very brilliant for decades ahead."
5252,False,"Images of a routine baptism juxtaposed with those of mafia rival executions. To me, that's why ""The Godfather""is so fascinating. With these people, such bloody acts are strictly business, impersonal. Great characters and scenes emerge from this conceit, but that's really what it's all about. I don't think you can look at this movie without considering its lasting impact; the famous lines, set pieces and those dreaded oranges. It's all seeped into pop culture, and for good reason. It's just that damn good. Even if you're repulsed by Cosa Nostra goings-on, you still get drawn in. This is an epic in every sense of the word.9/10"
5253,False,"An Example of Cult Classic,Simply A Mind Blower and An All Time Top Listed Movie. Al Pacino Was Amazing. The Whole Movie is One Hell of A Drama. The Whole time we looking forward to outcome. One of the Best Crime Dramas Ever. Screen Time of Every Actors were pitch perfect and The Script was just A Classic Script Itself."
5254,False,"This is the movie that created the mobster genre. It took mob movies to an entirely new level of depth. Plot, dialogue, intrigue, all top notch to compliment the action. In addition the cast was legendary and all of them were at the top of their game. If you ever thought all mob movies are the same it is because they all copied The Godfather!"
5255,False,"See something new every time I see it.A right mixture of tragedy and comedy.Found a common love and appreciation everywhere screened. Characters and all of the different personalities caricatured in this movie lives among us.The cast is so popular and familiar which attached me to the cast very much as true to the life.Sounds, music, color and light in this film are just remarkable. The methodology followed in filming each frame is highly appreciated.Emotions conveyed in the film can be felt in depth by each one of the viewers clearly and at large.Who can rate this wonderful movie for which the a simple common rate card is not suffice."
5256,False,"Best film ever, greatest cast, the soundtrack and cinematography.I have seen this movie probably 100 times and each time I capture something new.Marlon Brando is the greatest character and an example of a wise mafia boss.Al Pacino is a wonderful fit into a coldblooded next in line, showing a great character, amazing charisma, sweet looks and merciless heart.HIs relationship with the brother Freddy after his betrayal is so powerful , specially the words that describe the mafia family values where you never go against your family.Female character is powerful as well."
5257,False,"Lets talks about the godfather. Now i know what everyone is thinking, 27 nominations and 23 was won. Very accomplished movie to say the least but that's not what makes it a great movie. What makes it a great movie is that it is timeless! It exceeds every expectation that was brought upon it. Now i know about 90 percent of IMDb users will say "" of course it's a great, what is there not to like about it. Well this movie does have a few flaws, not a lot but a few! But overall a fantastic piece of art. I've always wanted to create a movie that was visual as much as the godfather was or is. It really jumped Hollywood into a new era where mob movies were a thing and you could totally take risk with your story development and other things as well. I think it's fair to say that this movie has probably inspired a lot of directors in the film industry or better known as ""Hollywood"". I'm not a screen writer so don't get on me to bad for my spelling at times in this review."
5258,False,"This movie is awesome. Don Vito Corleone character was amused. I really liked the concept very much. The movie represents the real Gang type of thing. The godfather scenario. The other parts of godfather movies are also very good.The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The Al Pacino character was also a strong character. Overall its a great movie to watch.It spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. Worth the full time of watching. Deserves a rating 10 from me. Christopher Nolan is the boss."
5259,False,"My reviews are designed to be short, sweet and to the point and this is my first! Superb cast, all the actors played their characters convincingly and with authority. Some people may find the length of the film too long but in my opinion there isn't a dull moment. This film is both classy and brutal at the same time and nothing and nobody should turn down an offer they cannot refuse. Considering the problems encountered in the making of the film, Coppola does a fine job and the film is a well deserved masterpiece that should be in everybody's collection. All I can say to you now is, if you haven't seen it yet, go and buy it!"
5260,False,"Excellent movie. This story has been influenced many script writers. They just copied some parts of this movie. And this movie is a lesson for Bachelor science students under Calicut university. My brother read about this movie from his textbook. The best casting was the top highlight. When I was a kid, I found the poster of godfather on cards. But I did not get any idea about it. Some of my friends read the book. From their information, I saw the movie. It was fantastic. And I know there were some immigrants from Italy. And Italian was a common language in some parts of the USA in 1940's and 1950's. The climax was one of the best movies. A different one. Yes, It is copied for new gen movie. And some scenes are still trying to copy. So we can say, This movie is GODFATHER."
5261,False,"One of the great movies that influenced filmmakers world wide. Great acting, direction, everything. No wonder why this is a classic. I recommend this movie to every film students. The visual language of this movie is something to be learned from. Francis Ford Coppola is one hell of a director. The mix of suspense, drama and the mafia story is just brilliantly done. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando did awesome acting.Nino Rota's music is so well done.Rota's score for The Godfather had been nominated for a 1973 Academy Award for Best Original Score. However, it was disqualified from consideration when the Academy learned Rota had used a more comedic version of the song for the film Fortunella (1958).Nonetheless, Rota's score for The Godfather Part II won the 1974 Academy Award for Best Score, despite the fact that it contained the same piece.Overall a great experience that makes you wanna come back to it."
5262,False,"Widely viewed around the world as one of the best American films ever made, the opening movie from the crime saga The Godfather is a milestone of cinema history. The Godfather, together with Star Wars, from 1972 has become one of the most parodied movies ever. Director Francis Ford Coppola paints an amazing portrait of the Corleone clan's rise and near fall from power in the US as well as in Italy. Francis Ford Coppola masterfully manages to balance the story between the Corleone's family life and the vast crime business in which they are engaged.The story views the Mafia from the inside as Francis Ford Coppola saw it, and as Mario Puzo did when he originally wrote the book in which he portrayed the story presented here. This movie is a great way to spend a rainy afternoon, capicce."
5263,False,"Great movie! A real class of good values, good conduct and moral. Incredible performance from all the actors.The best part is when Mike is going to detonate the head of those two guys in the restaurant.The most sinister part of the movie is when they shoot into the couple's bedroom.The funniest part is when Sonny throws a few dollars on the floor for the intruder photographer.It's worth watching again, then come back here and make some more considerations."
5264,False,"Forever one of my all time favorites... Top 10 movies in my library. Michael Corleone: Well, when Johnny was first starting out, he was signed to a personal services contract with this big-band leader. And as his career got better and better, he wanted to get out of it. But the band leader wouldn't let him. Now, Johnny is my father's godson. So my father went to see this bandleader and offered him $10,000 to let Johnny go, but the bandleader said no. So the next day, my father went back, only this time with Luca Brasi. Within an hour, he had a signed release for a certified check of $1000. Kay Adams: How did he do that? Michael Corleone: My father made him an offer he couldn't refuse. Kay Adams: What was that? Michael Corleone: Luca Brasi held a gun to his head, and my father assured him that either his brains or his signature would be on the contract....... Thats a true story. Michael Corleone: Luca Brasi held a gun to his head, and my father assured him that either his brains or his signature would be on the contract. Thats a true story."
5265,False,"the greatest crime show i have ever seen. The godfather is a tale about revenge, betrayal,love and hustle. On this hand, A powerful and rich family. An Organized crime empire passed down from father to son. On the other hand, Other ruthless powerful rival families. Special thanks to Al-Pacino and Robert De Niro. Some of the greatest Actors of our time.The motion picture (in view of a script labored over for quite a while by Puzo and afterward at last given frame, I think, by executive Francis Ford Coppola) gets a similar vibe. We have a tendency to relate to Don Corleone's family not on the grounds that we burrow group wars, but rather in light of the fact that we have been with them from the earliest starting point, watching them sit tight for the fight to come while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper containers. ""The Godfather"" himself is not even the focal character in the dramatization. That position goes to the most youthful, brightest child, Michael, who comprehends the way of his dad's position while modifying his antiquated ways. The Godfather's part in the family endeavor is portrayed by his name; he remains outside the cutting edge which will continue and, ideally, point the family into genuine undertakings."
5266,False,"This movie is really amazing, it is quite long but it is well worked the whole way through. The story is continuously a work of art that never stops. I really love the performance of Al Pacino and Marlon Brando, they are truly both well suited for this types of movies. No wonder that Al Pacino is doing the characters he does. I would recommend this movie to all ages. Even though the movie is about mafia and murderers, I would say it still okay to watch for a younger audience since the material is not that bloody. The best part is that there are two more movies to see after you have finished this one. I love these movies, the surroundings, clothing and atmosphere is just amazing."
5267,False,"Ooh... The Godfather. Definitely the best motion picture I have ever seen. The acting is great, the set, the plot, everything... perfect! The original music score is absolutely superb. No more words for such a masterpiece. 11 out of 10 stars. I first saw the Godfather in 2009, as an 11 year old boy, back then. That was when my love for Al Pacino and movies from the Crime/Drama genre was established. F. F. Coppola's work is remarkable and I personally think that this particular film should have been at the top, instead of Shawshank Redemption. They are both unique, but maybe the Godfather is just a bit better. Also the Godfather Part II is definitely the best sequel in the history of motion pictures. Be well."
5268,False,"Watching The Godfather is a requirement for Human Citizenship. The GodFather is not a movie but more a pillar to understanding the human race. I am going to keep this review short and sweet.. Don't watch the GodFather, but embrace the jewels of life it offers and it will teach you life lessons beyond what you can imagine. <<<---This was what I wrote before IMDb prompted me that my review does not contain enough lines and I need at least 10 lines of text. I will take this opportunity to commend the perfect selection of the cast and crew. Usually, every movie I watch there is ALWAYS some sort of comment or critique I add within the first 30 minutes of the movie. The Godfather & Braveheart are the only two films that I have not had a critique for which still boggles me to this day. The Godfather is the only movie that I could watch over and over and will continue to watch over and over throughout my life, and not get bored even just a little to say the least. This is not a movie..It's A Lifestyle."
5269,False,"This is one of the mythical films in the history of cinema. As well as Taxi driver, I think it is overrated. If it is true that the film has an impressive setting. That the actors are very well. The problem is that it does not catch me. He can not hook me. When it seems that it is going to put interesting Al Pacino goes away of trip and does things that do not make sense and that do not come to story.The photography is spectacular, such as art, makeup, costumes, the overall setting is fine. The actors also do very well.The management however, although it takes well the tone, but is that to my Coppola I do not like, I am sorry, but I do not like how it directs. He can not catch me in any way. Neither with history nor with beauty, which does not exist, nor with plans. I do not like anything that is a film shot basically in the foreground. Of course it has open plans, but all the conversations are in the foreground, there is nothing staging. The character of Al Pacino seems totally inconsistent to me, as soon as it says white makes black. It is the most variable character of the whole cast.Yet this is the best of the three, because the two is worse and the three is worse still in every way."
5270,False,"PARA MI ES UNA DE LAS MEJORES PELICULAS DE TODOS LOS TIEMPOSThe complex story of a mafia family led by a ruthless family man and honorary man (immense Marlon Brando), whose power inherits his most peaceful son (I believe in America). An awakening Al Pacino first-timer) is, above all, a narrative exercise of insuperable level: the brilliant dissection of all the characters, the masterful rhythm that alternates long family sequences with credible action scenes, and a perfect setting get a film Who entered ""violently"" among the best classics of all time, to rise to the title of top work of modern cinema."
5271,False,"this was one of the best movies by far. I researched that this was one of the best blockbusters selling point. Although the movie is great no matter what day and age you watch it. I don't think it will be a great idea to try to remake this movie . The old gangster movie is represented by Richard Conte and Sterling Hayden in bit parts. I would love to see another movie like this that is based out in Hollywood like this movie. If you read the book you would understand why there's so many books and movies and most movies don't stand toe and toe with the book but this one did. This is a old movie way before my time but the thrill and the envy of all the characters , family love it make you keep wanting to keep watching."
5272,False,"To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility."
5273,False,"""The Godfather"" along with ""The Gofather: Part II"" are the best movies I have ever seen. Absolutely everything of it is magnificent, pure magic, gold, etc. The performances, the directing, the screenplay, the production, the script, the soundtrack, the film editing, the costume design, and the list goes on and on. The performances are excellent, all of them, through that you can see all the work the director Francis Ford Coppola made, which is one i truly admire. This movie is irreplaceable, a true piece of art. A classic. It involves love, crime, passion, negotiations, family, loyalty, respect. For me is just the perfect combo, because I love movies with violence, I also love movies with romance. I think there will never be a movie as perfect as this one."
5274,False,"The best movie of all time, because it shows what true character development is in a movie. The character arch of Michael Corleone through the movies is one of the best ever written. It succeeds not only in pulling off the use of a classical/formal/mannered film language correctly and remarkably; that language is used to emotionally evoke a grand archetypal American narrative, Operatic and Tragic, built around an immigrant family, and charting its rise, corruption, and fall in ways that comment on a vast array of subjects that relate to the American condition: Marriage, Politics, Poverty, Crime, Innocence Lost, Violence, Loyalty, Betrayal, etc. etc. So: It's a classical tale told nearly perfectly; with rich, soulful acting, magnificent cinematography, and insinuating, meaningful dialogue."
5275,False,"I guess the same kind of folks who made The Sopranos one of the highest-rated TV shows in history made this film a 9.2 on IMDb. I sure don't get it. I think there is also a slight bias towards rating longer movies higher. Quantity does not equal, or compensate for the lack of, quality.Star-studded cast? Check. Outstanding director? Check. Dramatic and compelling plot? No.A drama should be dramatic. It should be compelling. We should care about the outcome. This film achieved none of those objectives.Some have lauded it as a fantastic sketch of organized crime. I suppose if you think of it more as a fictional docudrama, maybe your expectations would allow you to enjoy it more.The only compelling aspect of the film was the progression of Michael Corleone. The movie did bring that full circle, and I will dance around the details here to avoid spoilers. Nevertheless, that one somewhat interesting aspect was not enough to redeem the movie. And even in that aspect, the film did nothing to make the viewer CARE about Michael or why he evolved as he did.About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very Good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A Classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating)"
5276,False,"The Godfather I-II is far the best film ever. It's the per excellence for cinema in terms of narrative, acting, technique, and visibility. Some might argue that it is nor revolutionary, for example, such as The Citizen Cane. I totally agree with that argument that the GodFather I-II is not revolutionary in terms of narrative and form. Yet, but what it perfectly does is to combine all the virtues and improvements of cinematography, and raise them to an advanced level. At its time, it seems it's the end of cinema in terms of perfection. Moreover, it paved the way for the emergence of a new breed of actors such as Robert DE Niro, Al Pacino, James Caan, John Cazale, Taila Shire, Diane Keaton. It made Robert Duvall a power player in Hollywood Cinema, and gave a legend, Marlon Brando a chance to make an honorable leave that he unfortunately did fail to use. Regarding direction, Coppola set the standards for perfect directing. I was born in 1975, that is to mean, I did not remember 70s but as I started to watch films and became an aficionado for films, I realized that only the Godfather I-II is enough to call '70s' as the best decade of modern cinema."
5277,False,"The Godfather is altogether fantastic film. It is, in my personal opinion, flawless in every way. People who have not seen this film, I am warning you, because this review will contain spoilers. First off, let's talk about the acting. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are fantastic. And other actors who are first starting out in this movie, such as Robert Duvall (To Kill a Mockingbird) and James Caan (Elf) are also fantastic. Robert Duvall gives a phenomenal performance as Tom Hagen. He gave a good depth to the film by him trying to convince Michael and The Godfather about all the things that they are doing are bad. And James Caan gives a great performance as Sonny, who likes to get himself in trouble. Then, Marlon Brando plays in his Oscar winning role as Don Vito Corleone or The Godfather. He was amazing as the Don. The way he acted with his voice, and his hand movements, and you could just feel his reign of power over everyone else, but you can sense that his control his failing when the other five families try to kill him in the process. Now, let's talk about Al Pacino as Michael Corleone. I still do not understand why Al Pacino has not won an Oscar for his role as Michael. Especially for his role in The Godfather Part II. Al Pacino blew me away with his performance. What I like the most about his character was it showed his character arc perfectly. It shows how he realizes that the only way that he can protect his father is become part of the family business, and Pacino portrays that aspect of his character so well. For the way the film was done, it was done great. I liked all the hazes of grey and brown everywhere, it gave it an older feel to it, which made it very good. And the score composed by Nino Rota is absolutely great. It fit the feel of the movie great, I hum it all the time, so I give the movie big credit for that. But, probably the biggest thing in this movie that makes it shine, and I would give it the most credit for, is how this film perfectly balances the struggling life of the Corleone family, and the ugly violence of their life in the mafia. It balances it great, I am in awe in how they were able to balance it, because most movies today when they try to do that, they usually tip more towards one subject over the other. But The Godfather keeps those two story lines balanced throughout the entire three hour run time of the movie. And another thing that I have to say, or else I am absolutely insane not to mention this, are the amount of famous quotes in this movie! This movie is filled with lines that you will be saying constantly, like the famous line ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse!"" by Vito Corleone, or ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli."" that other movies copy off of all the time! So, this really is probably the best movie I have ever seen, I have no flaws with this movie, which is why I shall give this movie a 10/10, and I highly suggest you check this movie out, it is an amazing experience!"
5278,False,"I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him"
5279,False,"Beautiful movie that will last throughout time.The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons."
5280,False,"I have to admit that although I have not had any information about the subject for many years, I would think that it would be a heavy future, and that I would face the film and such a thing. I do not think that it is such an exaggerated script, the impressive aspect of Filmin is not it. It was all over it. It was a great story that Michael, like Michael, turned himself into a character who could not feel his family's way of life, and that he had become his father over time. Brando's character was a legend in itself. If you're still watching, do not waste any time.I did not see such a heavy character. I regret that I watched too late. The work of the family was very well done. The tones of the auditions were all legendary. It was the most beautiful film I've ever seen in my life."
5281,False,"The term is far overused, but 'The Godfather' truly is a masterpiece and easily the best crime/mafia movie I've ever seen. There is little point going over the story because I'm sure the 2000+ reviews have already covered it, but it is as close to perfect as an organised crime movie has ever got.The acting is first class throughout, with Al Pacino delivering the stand out performance, and the cinematography is very impressive, contributing towards a great and memorable viewing experience.'The Godfather' is easily the most absorbing 3 hour movie ever made. The fact that this has remained one of the most popular movies over 40 years after release says it all. A genuine masterpiece."
5282,False,"The greatest mafia movie ever. If you think again, you will realize that writing a review about The Godfather is quite stupid! This is a movie, every person in this world should have seen before death!If you get past the first hour the movie is highly entertaining with great dialog and great acting. Al Pacino is one of the greatest actors in American History in my opinion.Watching the movie the second time made me realize that this is probably one of he greatest movies ever. The character development is excellent and you understand that more upon the second viewing.In summary, if you haven't seen this movie don't expect to be blown away the first time watching. Let the movie develop and when the movie ends you will want to watch it again from the beginning to understand everything that happened. After that you would be hard pressed to deny this movie as one of the greatest."
5283,False,"The greatest mafia movie ever. With brilliant playing by specially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone this film reveals how one among the mind mafia families in Ny works, it gives a comprehensive image of how their company runs and what sort an opportunities they got to take on their company. Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family."
5284,False,"Likely among the greatest mafia movie ever. Nothing less. That is by far the greatest film ever to give organized crime to a portrait, this film shows all of it inside out and goes deep in.With brilliant playing by specially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone this film reveals how one among the mind mafia families in Ny works, it gives a comprehensive image of how their company runs and what sort an opportunities they got to take on their company, for instance their abnegation in step inside the narcotic company brings on a lot of problems, but additionally it reveals what sorta sacrifices they make, each day might be their last day.

5285,False,"The godfather is the most favorite movie ever the three parts are the most great movies in the history in my opinion it contain the fathers of our cinema now days, a story that tell the truth about the mafia and even the people who control the illegal business and the way that end up. shows the family that always feel proud of its own Sicilian origin's i already watched this movie more that 12 time with friends, family, and I'm even ready to watch it more and more, Don Corleone is one of my favorite characters and the way he always shows of the strong man that doesn't know how to bow and give up easily and at the same time you can see the part of care about his family in the last seine and the part of killing his eldest son Tom, and always KEEP YOUR FRIEND CLOSE AND YOUR ENEMY CLOSER."
5286,False,"The way the story is planted is very very good plus the excellent performance of the actors and the awesome work of all the production from the director till the minimum detail specialist. A good reflection of the violent human nature and the things that we as human beans are able to do to get and protect what we want. for me the most important aspect of the movie is the way it makes the emotions get touch in a very deep way. Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business."
5287,False,"This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on a lot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family. As well Marlon Brando was amazing in this movie.This is definitely a masterpiece."
5288,False,"The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): ""Don't ever take sides against the family.""It is significant that the first shot is inside a dark, shuttered room. It is the wedding day of Vito Corleone's daughter, and on such a day a Sicilian must grant any reasonable request. A man has come to ask for punishment for his daughter's rapist. Don Vito asks why he did not come to him immediately.I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com. It not only suggests great movies to watch, it also tells where you can watch the movie online.. Highly recommended."
5289,False,"This is simply the greatest film ever made. It has everything from great cinematography to perfect acting. We all know of course that Marlon Brando brings his best performance here but so does every other actor. The greatness of this film cannot be undone and what makes it even better is the way it utilizes this. A story of backstabbing, honor, the mafia way of life and a lot of partying makes this film a true masterpiece.I'm not gonna talk about the story since I'm pretty sure you already know it, if not then the other reviews will cover it. I do however want to point out that it may be simple on paper but is far more complicated once you see the film. To summarize this i have to say I've never seen a more perfect film. Simply breathtaking!"
5290,False,"The Godfather is a 2006 open world action-adventure video game developed by EA Redwood Shores and published by Electronic Arts. Originally released in March 2006 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows, it was later released for the PlayStation Portable as The Godfather: Mob Wars, Xbox 360 as The Godfather: The Game, Wii as The Godfather: Blackhand Edition, and PlayStation 3 as The Godfather: The Don's Edition.The game is based upon the 1972 film of the same name, and tells the story of an original character, Aldo Trapani, whose rise through the ranks of the Corleone family intersects with the plot of the film on numerous occasions. His actions in the game often take the form of events that happened off screen in the film; for example, he avenges Bonasera's daughter, he drives Vito Corleone to the hospital after he is shot, he plants the gun for Michael Corleone to kill Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey, he places the horse's head in Jack Woltz's bed. Although the game was condemned by Francis Ford Coppola, who claimed Paramount never told him about its development or asked for his input, it does feature voice acting from several stars of the film, including James Caan as Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and Abe Vigoda as Salvatore Tessio. Marlon Brando also recorded dialogue for Vito Corleone, in what would be his final acting job, but his ill health made most of his recordings unusable. Al Pacino, who played Michael Corleone in the film, is absent in both likeness and voice, choosing to lend his image instead to Scarface: The World Is Yours.The Godfather received mixed to positive reviews across most systems, although the PSP version was generally seen as inferior to the others. The game was a commercial success, selling over two million units. In 2009, a sequel was released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows. Based on the 1974 film, The Godfather Part II, the sequel did not sell as well nor do as well with critics as had the original, and EA scrapped plans for an adaptation of the third film."
5291,False,"The best drama I've ever seen. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando had amazing performances. This has been the most important role for Al Pacino, and he has achieved the fame with this movie. I like very much the Vito Corleone's voice and role. It's unforgettable. I like the Robert Duvall's role too. The plot is very interesting and thought provoking. It has many elements like drama situations, crimes, and romances too. I also think that this is the best crime movie about Sicilian mafia. When I was watching the film for the first time, I was paying much attention and trying to figure it out. Maybe, you have to watch it two times at least for best understanding.For me, this is the best Francis Ford Coppola's movie. He has known how to adapt the Mario Puzo's novel to the wide screen. The Godfather II is good as well, so any of them can be your favorite. I highly recommend this movie, and I'm sure you will want to see it many times. It lasts about 3 hours, but you won't feel it. Now, you have to plan to see this movie and enjoy. Then you could watch Godfather II and III if you want more."
5292,False,"The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons.""The Godfather"" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.But Brando's performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whispery, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although ""The Godfather"" is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn't time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he'll have to cancel his day at the races).The success of ""The Godfather"" as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garroting.Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so ""The Godfather"" becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they'd tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn't have worked. But it's uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish-brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other."
5293,False,"One of the best motion pictures having a complete package of awesome acting, cinematography, direction and almost everything. The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction to the acting, to the story-line, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. It's amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together. . . .

5294,False,"When I was little a didn't like it a lot...But after several years I watched it again and WoW ! From the beginning to the end it so interesting.Yeah I know it is old but this movie is so good that I doubt that soon we will see something as good as this.I watched it more than 20 times and every time I watched it with the same interest.The script was wrote so good but after its combined with actors its just perfect.I read and the book but we have to agree that this is the first time when the movie is better than the book.Why? Easy - when we read we have all in our head but here we see something which is better.There are a lot of good actors which did this. And Marlon Brando - speechless. This role was perfect played and it was perfect for him.Here just a perfect movie which is mixed of one time script , actors and unique soundtrack."
5295,False,"The Godfather is written & directed by Francis Ford Coppola and stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall and Richard Conte.The ageing patriarch of an organised crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son.Whenever you get into a discussion with someone about filmmaking or ask about their favourite movies of all time, at some point they will mention The Godfather. There's a very simple explanation for this, and it's something to be discovered when experiencing the movie for yourself.It's very clear how incredibly well written this movie is, from the first scene, to the last. Not only the writing, but the magnetic performances throughout are consistently showcased against a backdrop of New York from 1945-1955. One of the reasons this movie is so beautiful is because of how realistic it is. Although we can't say we've been a part of an empire like featured in the movie, we can all relate to the characters. It's a dark and tragic story.The acting as aforementioned is phenomenal. Brando is vitally important in his convincing portrayal of Don Vito Corleone. As is Al Pacino as he gradually becomes the front-man during the movie's running-length. Caan has a heart-breaking turn in his character's arc, and he performs wonderfully. The same for Duvall, Conte and everyone else not mentioned. The list is too long to name each individual, but they don't go unnoticed.Although this is a long movie, there's so much going on and in such intricate detail that the time effortlessly drifts by. Every character has a chance to transform within the time-frame. Don't be put off by the duration. Many filmmakers these days are afraid of making their work too long, but if done correctly, it can be a tremendous piece of art. This movie is a fine example of that fact.The original score by Nino Rota is one of the most recognised soundtracks of all time, and respectfully so. There are moments where his music is used greatly, and moments where it isn't used at all. While this happens the music is changing also. It's the perfect sound for such a story, and pairs with the picture brilliantly.Verdict; The Godfather is widely regarded as a masterpiece. One of the greatest movies of our time. I can fully agree with these statements and add that in its many years since release, it hasn't aged a bit. If you haven't yet experienced The Godfather, please do yourself a favour. With so much greatness in front of you, it's an offer you can't refuse.The Godfather, 10/10."
5296,False,"You simply cannot leave this world without watching this absolute masterpiece. No spoilers will be given here, i will just tell that you MUST watch it! From the soundtrack to the way the scenes are shot. All The sequences in the film planned to the detail so you can have a sensation of fluidity within almost 3 hours of pure epicness. All the details about the mafia underworld are there. Also, the detail and importance of all characters who appear in the screen is superb, leaving no one without importance or purpose. Also, the casting of Marlon Brando and pretty much everyone was just perfect, as the future would prove few years later. If you do not enjoy this movie, you wont enjoy any other."
5297,False,This is one of the best movies I have EVER!! seen. The depth of characters. The drama. The griping story. Everything is just perfect. Pacing of this movie is a bit slow at times but it's needed to build up to something bigger if you know what I mean. And the soundtrack? Beautiful music which fits perfectly for the movie. Nino Rota did a great job. Marlon Brando as godfather was the best casting for the role ever! He just showed how acting should be done. Again one the well made and perfectly crafted movies ever. If you haven't seen this. You are really missing out! Go ahead and watch it right now! You will not be disappointed.

Well, Godfather is a film that talks about mafia, drugs, death, violence, illegality, corruption, addiction, etc .. yet he is beautiful, beautiful, it seems ennoble impure acts at the same time cause the same disclaimers, but end you delights and surprises, because it also talks about family, loyalty, friendship and acceptance, watch this movie, even if it is your movie genre, at least try, there's no way you leave the loss with this work as striking the 7 art.Sorry for my English translator google."
5299,False,"When i watched Godfather for first time, i feel something in my heart. The whole movie is just a masterpiece. The emotion, the drama, everything about this movie is something special. This movie gave to you something you don't find in other movies. Legendary cast.. Marlon Brando which i con sired one of the greatest actor. Al Pacino which also is for me one of the greatest. Great cinematography, maybe one of the best i've ever seen. Francis Ford Coppola maybe isn't greatest director ever but he deserved so much respect for what he did in this movie. How i can got over? The script. Easily one of the best scripts in the history. Storyline is very very good. Godfather is one of few movies when are 100 % focused on what happened next. Personally i feel very shocked when i watch this movie for the first time. For me, there will be no movie like Godfather. Godfather is something you just can't hate. Godfather is the world 8th miracle. Godfather is life. Godfather tells you about life and how you should always love your family. Maybe not a good review for this movie but i cannot find the right words to describe a perfect movie. Thank you."
5300,False,"This movie is phenomenal. Coppola's masterpiece one of my favorite movie. Great casting, great writing, great directing. Coppola has made one of the best cult movies of all time. This movie aged well, his 34 years old but still has a strong cultural influence. Al Pacino, Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall are insane. They acting is phenomenal. This movie has a really strong part. The Godfather is not just a mafia movie, it's not a move just for the mafia and crime movie fans, this movie is recommended for everyone. The movie has a great artistic approach and a great message. The movie is so memorable a lasts for a life."
5301,False,"This is the only i can watch a hundred times without getting tired it just by A+ rating!!!! For me everything was perfect!!!! The Godfather is my all time best. It starts out in a unique fashion, a story giving us an insight into the life of a mafia group and how it became a family business span of over three to four generations. This story is encapsulated with love, politics, religion, betrayal, trust and everything regular thing you can find in life. There has never been a movie like this that catches my attention like this one and there might not be another. I love the entire story and there was never a dull moment. I don't do any other thing while watching the Godfather it is not possible.I like the story, the cast, the everything.It's a must watch movie."

5303,False,"""For justice, we must go to Don Corleone.""Out of the vast amount of movies, more than 50,000 total to date as of this review, only a few films are described by many a noted film critic as a ""perfect movie"". However, one of those movies, to me, deserves the title of being the most perfect movie out of 'em all. That movie is the 1972 crime drama by the name of ""The Godfather"".Based on the novel by Italian-American author Mario Puzo, this was the movie that revolutionized the art of gangster pictures since its inception. This wasn't like films such as The Roaring Twenties (1939) or The Public Enemy (1931), which were about ordinary mobster life. Instead, we focus on an entire family of the mafia that runs a vast empire in New York City, lead by the aging, yet all powerful Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He's retiring from the business, and has to choose which one of his sons to take his place, either the hair-trigger tempered Sonny (James Caan), adopted son, consigliere, and lawyer Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), or his youngest son and war hero Michael (Al Pacino). However, as this is happening, unexpected things are happening within the Corleone family itself including selling out and betrayal, and an all-out war between all of the five families (Corleone, Barzini, Tattaglia, Stracci, and Cuneo) is brewing that turns the entire city into a blood-drenched war zone where only one can remain supreme.The film is directed by Francis Ford Coppola, whom prior to this was also responsible for movies like Finian's Rainbow (1968), You're A Big Boy Now (1966) and The Rain People (1969), none of which were very successful box office-wise. The Godfather was the turning point of Coppola's career, not just because most of his future pictures would be smash hits, but would also earn him his first Best Picture win. The film itself is poetic, thanks to the assistance from the book's author Mario Puzo, who also wrote the screenplay for the picture. Coppola illustrates both the positive and negative sides of mafia life, the fall and rise of an underground empire, and the meaning of loyalty all at once. All of the main characters in the film are also relatable and three-dimensional to a tee. You actually feel for them and understand their mindset, making it true to life, to where even actual mobsters commend the film for its realism.Future gangster pictures like Brian De Palma's Scarface (1983), Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990), and Mike Newell's Donnie Brasco (1997) owe something to this movie, aside from the fact that two of those films also star Pacino, making it about not just about the career of a mobster, but also about the mobster himself and the relationship between his colleagues. In other words, they're in-depth character studies, and that's what makes The Godfather a truly epic and moving film, let alone a film that, as I've mentioned in the beginning, is described as a ""perfect movie"". Even teachers in colleges and universities that teach film studies or any form of filmmaking would refer to showing this film as part of a curriculum. Overall, it's a film that is considered mandatory viewing for every moviegoer, even if you don't like sitting through films that are nearly or over 3 hours. If you haven't seen it, stop what you're doing right now and see it."
5304,False,"Must watch together with all the 3 parts The Godfather series is widely regarded as the greatest films in world cinema and is seen as one of the most influential films of all time, especially in the gangster genre. The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.The Godfather presents the gangster's perspective of the Mafia as a response to corrupt society. Although the Corleone family is presented as immensely rich and powerful, no scenes depict prostitution, gambling, loan sharking or other forms of racketeering. Some critics argue that the setting of a criminal counterculture allows for unapologetic gender stereotyping, and is an important part of the film's appeal (""You can act like a man!"", Don Vito tells a weepy Johnny Fontane)"
5305,False,"Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it. Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York's Italian crime families."
5306,False,"I have watched The Godfather so many times I'd be rich for every dollar viewed, that said, I cannot fault this cinematic masterpiece, that perfectly romanticizes organized crime. The characters develop especially Al Pacino's Michael, but all the actors have something to do and say and in a style that has today become synonymous with Coppola. The violence is stylized like a 1950s movie. The dialogue moves every scene forward. It breaks every rule by starting with a wedding and it works. Coppola has great fun with every scene, so evident in his use of family members, notably Talia Shire. Writing this has made me want to watch it again. Perfection!"
5307,False,"this film, is the best film I ever seen out of hundreds of movies. every other month I feel that I need to watch the first part or the second part of the series of the God father again and again. Which they are the best. even they were considered 70s but they still one of the best movies have ever produced and have been filmed to the humanity ! story of power and energy, family, reality of American History. also no one can ignore the music and themes of this films that takes to different world or different planet. the Italian accent also is adding a lot of art to the movie picture. with one word describing this film it is a story of dreams life !"
5308,False,"I am not going to tell you why I think this film is great. There are very few films that have been discussed so intently as this one (Citizen Kane and Casablanca are the only two that come to mind that might be more respected) and there is nothing I can say that hasn't been said. Also, I'm not going to try and change your mind, it's probably already set and if you are anything like me, it's not changing anytime soon. Besides, film is art not science and art is about emotion. No movie has meant as much to me as The Godfather, let me tell you why. I think I got hooked on movies because I am an obsessive person. If I read a good book I must read ALL of the authors work--two days into The Road, I had ordered McCarthy's other nine books. Everybody loves movies. I bet one in three adults hasn't touched a book in over a year but most of us make our pilgrimage to the local multiplex at least once every month or two and there are a handful of movies--whether they be Citizen Kane and 400 blows or Die Hard and The Rock--that we'll watch whenever they're on TV. At eleven or twelve, I certainly had my list of favorites but most of them were simply entertaining. I've since learned to appreciate Raiders of the Lost Ark as a piece of film making and ET as a genuinely brilliant work of art (its one of those movies you loved as a kid but love even more as an adult) but the Godfather was really the first movie that blew me a way. I may not have been able to tell you why but even back then i could tell, this was something special, this was a work of art. This film, along with its sequel (I like to think of them as one movie, mainly so I don't have to pick a favorite) Have topped my list of all time favorites for as long as I care to remember. Often I've wondered if its simply because of how strong my initial reaction was after that first viewing but every time I re watch it, from the beginning or starting in the middle, I'm reassured that it truly is the greatest film of all time. 'I believe in America,' still makes the hairs on my neck stand up, right down to the final scene when they close the door. The baptism is one of the greatest scenes in cinema, or is it the one at the toll booth, or at the wedding, or in the restaurant. There are too many. It is a film that doesn't just work at every level, it works perfectly at every level. If you have not seen this film you cannot say you love movies. American cinema may not have began here but every film since has been made in its shadow. It is the greatest film of all time and will never be topped, Period."
5309,False,"The story of this film peeling from the life side of the area Corleone mafia family, a location in Sicily, Italy. Worked with a very neat, solid storyline, the acting of great stars of the very characteristic makes the movie The Godfather became a box office of all time. Proved in the world movie database site IMDb, the film which has 3 sequel ranks 2nd as the top rated movie under the movie Shawshank Redemption. The Godfather is a portrait of a Mafia family in New York, played with remarkable by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. If you ever watch this movie, I'm sure you'll agree with my review on these two Hollywood stars. Marlon Brando played Don Vito and Al-Pacino acted as his son named Michael. If not careful, the character of the role of these two men might impart life to the character of the audience. I am not making this up, after the film was released and success in the market, appears similar genre films in Hollywood which explores the life of mafia."
5310,False,"I do not think i have ever seen such a magnificent piece of art in motion. Breathless, Composed and full of aloofness. GOD FATHER stands head and shoulder above the rest.The story is full of vivid imagination and given birth to a new genre of Crime/Gangster version. Which before GOD FATHER was a taboo subject and considered to be destined doom.The characters have done full justice to the plot, playing out the roles with perfection. Credit must also be given to masterful directorship,All an All GODFATHER remains the best piece of movie i have seen in my life and it has certainly inspired many moves of my life.Fantastic!"
5311,False,One of the best movies I have seen from Hollywood. I think this was the masterpiece of the happiest day for my parents because I was the first son from them and they are not the only one who is the best solution for small business as usual and I am useful to you by the way to go to the school where I have grown up in the outbreak of encounter and subsequent rebel killings.Police said the rebels were hiding in the show is going to be further from the very least I can do it for a while back and forth between the two of the happiest day for my parents because I was the first son from them and they are not the only one who is the best solution for small business as usual and I am useful to you by the way to go to the school where I have grown up in the outbreak of encounter and subsequent rebel killings.Police said the rebels were hiding in the show is going to be further from the very least I can do it for a while back and forth between the two of the happiest day for my parents because I was the first son from them.
5312,False,"I think that the Godfather is an American classic, that perfectly mixes film and real history regarding the Italian mafia. I watched this film with my grandfather, and it was the basis for my senior thesis. i have studied Coppola' touch, and am studying to be a director myself. The Godfather is the reason that i myself am invested in the film industry. i want to make movies for the records. I want to make movies that for generations will be remembered. The cinematography is stellar, and the acting is classic. Al Pacino is playing a golden role and Marlon Brando live through these characters. this movie all around is one of the greatest movies every made for the silver screen."
5313,False,"Extremely Engrossing motion picture, that features some of the finest editing, cinematography and performances ever. There is a wonderful theme of family that runs through this film and its later sequels. No one is truly judged. Love is unconditional. God is the one who truly judges. Easily, the word masterpiece describes this film, but that's been said by so many...Who am I to argue? Masterpiece is right on the money Extremely Engrossing motion picture, that features some of the finest editing, cinematography and performances ever.

5314,False,"Simply the most deep drama i've ever witnessed, my favorite movie of all time, such a beautiful harmony, smooth narration, stunning music and especially outstanding acting by Marlon Brondo. Francis ford Coppola along with the score from Nino Rota delivered the most complete drama experience ever on the big screen.the transition of Mike from a man who defends Honor and law to the completely opposite, driven by the love of his family i watched the movie long time ago when i was very young so i couldn't understand his beauty, i re-watched it more than 2 times now and every time is the same effect, you keep thinking of the story and the act for the coming weeks, Godfather is undoubtedly a rare masterpiece."
5315,False,"The son of a Mafia boss returns from the war and following an attempt on his father's life becomes more and more embroiled in the shadowy world of organized crime. Francis Ford Coppola's classic gangster saga is the story of a criminal dynasty headed by Marlon Brando in one of his most iconic roles. Coppola's direction is deceptively simple in that he uses no gimmicks or stylistic tricks; he merely allows the story to unfold and lets the superb cast do their thing. Brando's mumbling family and loyalty obsessed don has since become part of popular culture folklore (along with the classic score) and all other accompanying performances are top notch, from James Caan's hot headed Santino to Robert Duval's purely business orientated adviser. But this film is really the story of Michael's transition from honest war hero to shadowy underworld figure, played by Al Pacino in his finest role. The pivotal scene in which his newborn godson is baptized while Michael himself, the newborn ""Godfather"", is baptized in blood is an all time great. This is the birth of the modern gangster film and with the possible exception of Goodfellas, it is still to be surpassed. Source: http://www.huludb.com/movies/19122-the-godfather"
5316,False,"So if you asked me what was one of the best films of all time, guess what I would say? The Godfather! My experience with the godfather began all the way back when I was a little kid. I would watch scenes of this movie all the way from 9 years ago. The main reason I love this film, is because it managed to get a book with uncountable sub plots, and turn it into a film with only one plot, Michael's. The way the movie follows Michael, and shows his subtle change through ingenious imagery, and slow but interesting dialogue, into by the end of the film, the big man himself.And its not like Michael hogs the movie or anything, he allows space for Sonny and Vito to grow in, and even for minor characters to give outstanding jobs acting. Another thing, the acting. Oh my god, the acting in this film is phenomenally amazing! It shows you that you can get a bit of the character, dig a hole in it, pour a bit of yourself in to it, and you have yourself a great character, with you playing as it. God! What performances. Brando's performance as Vito, is a textbook case of too good an actor-itis. Not only does the film manage to get something classical like dialogue from the book, and add its own unique style of being calm, but yelling through the words you are saying. Also, the dialogue from this movie, is something so ahead of its time, -Sigh-it's so good. There is no real legitimate criticism I can give The Godfather, besides the fact that it took some sub plots and characters I loved from the book, and chopped them out of the film for a faster run time, which is fine, since the movie is like 4 hours long. I can't tell you much more about the film without giving it away, which would be really messed up as it is a must watch film. It's good. It's the pinnacle of cinema. The zenith of movies. Just watch it it's so great."
5317,False,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a clich√©. His performance though was not a clich√©. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable."
5318,False,"Best film ever, amazing cast, Marlon Brando, the finest actor of his generation. The Godfather simultaneously along many roads: the socio-political analysis (the corruption of the authorities to the Cuban revolution), the Bildungsroman, the traditional gangster film, the protest film (especially in the third chapter), then go back where he started, more and more dark and bitter, closing in on itself. In full respect of the rules of tragedy, from the ancient Greeks to the New Hollywood. Ambassador of narrative classicism tinged cinefilia and spiced with personal experiences of its director, fascination with corruption and violence as inherent in the construction of power factors of both a family and a nation, conjunction of talents in adverse conditions with successful results and unexpected, the proof that even in the most unexpected place can wait a stainless classic, the Godfather is all that and the opportunity to see this in a movie theatre is a pending issue that many viewers or not viewers should have fulfilled."
5319,False,"I would like to start with a thank you,Thank you, thank you, thank you for making this classic.By far the best motion picture i've seen, Lighting, Actors, Mood, Locations, Writing, Cinematography, Direction, Edit & Execution. Hands down it is a prefect movie in every shape of the word. The moment i began watching this movie it took me in, i'm not Italian but felt proud to be a Latin American after watching this because of the amount of pride and value the writer gave to these characters, the love of family is one that i can relate to being from a Hispanic family. Many similarities in the way we conduct our lives. Building up the Godfather, with the dramatic lighting, long cuts, the sense of realism as if you were there at the wedding says so much about the director. The roll of the god father must have been a hard roll to fill and execute, but Marlon Brando murdered it. He is nothing like any of his movies in the past. The embodiment of this character is one to remember. Hollywood needs more movies like this to be released in 2016 and 2017. I'll be waiting..."
5320,False,"The Godfather is one of the most epic movie of all times, this story is about one family and how they can change the society to achieve they goals. More than it is how a familiar drama can change our personality, the mafia way of life is a background to find redemption for our personal decisions. The story shows how a average man become a leader, for good and for bad, the process is hard and cost tears, blood and a piece of our souls. We learn from this thriller that we can't control our destiny, and even our reactions to life challenges isn't full of ourself, in essence great part of our acts is just instinct. This is the main argument and lesson here, we can't make plans in the long run, but we can train to respond to new obstacles. In familiar and professional career our dreams always will be submitted to the reality."
5321,False,"It is rare when when a film can tell so many diverse and interconnected stories all at once. Powerful performances, golden directing, and a perfect script that all contribute to The Godfather's fame in the world of films. This is not a bang bang boom slapped together type film to stuff the appetite of the average movie goers; it was carefully and perfectly crafted in every way imaginable. Conventional wisdom did not influence this films director, Francis Ford Coppola's vision is original in every way. This film is the alpha and omega of all films ever shot! Nothing will ever compare. I mean no other film can touch this. The acting is superb from the whole cast. Marlon Brando's part is vital for this film, his character is the soul of this masterpiece."
5322,False,"We know from Gay Talese's book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn't all sunshine and roses. More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of ""The Godfather,"" which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to."
5323,False,"Ok, I'll admit, I liked the Godfather, but #1 movie of all time?  That is sickening!  A good movie is not a movie that is ""fun"", if it was, then #1 would be a bad James Bond movie.  Any movie that is close to the top 10 should be a movie that gives you MEANING outside of the theater, not a movie about false organized crime!  How the hell did this movie get #1 if it's just a movie about killing?  The only movie I can think of that should get #1 is American Beauty."
5324,False,"I have heard the huge uproar about how great this movie is and I was looking forward to seeing it.  I had high expectations so I don't know how that affected my opinion, but I think the movie was a complete waste of my time. I had seen Road to Perdition not even a month before it and consider that movie to be far superior in an intellectual standpoint, considering the magnetic performances of Tom Hanks and Jude Law.  The only somewhat decent acting in The Godfather was done by Al Pacino and Sophie Coppola.  I almost fell asleep watching this thing. I do not understand why it is such a classic.  It was a waste of my three dollars to even rent it!"
5325,False,"I don't know why everybody who loves this film loves it so much. Maybe the fact everybody hyped it up meant i was never going to fully enjoy this but to be honest, it seemed slow and confusing and i struggled to keep my concentration. Constantly, i found myself drifting off and daydreaming. I would have stopped watching but i had a Uni assignment on it.It has some great scenes but everybody has seen them before anyway. The acting is good but I thought Al Pacino has been better in other things.Also, it was hard to make out, the characters speak so quietly it just turns into background noise.It's not the worst film I've ever seen, no way. but it certainly isn't in the top 10, not even close.The game is better, you get all the good scenes without the fairly dull bits in between."
5326,False,"Just another violent gang movie, whats the big deal? I hate these sort of movies about mafia guys going around with guns thinking they are all tough, put them in a ring one on one with Tyson and see how tough they are. I Don't understand why this movie is so praised, Whats the big deal? There is enough violent gang movies around, what makes this one special? There are so many movies better than this one out there, don't waste your time with this. I suppose there must be lots of fans of this movie like there is for lots of other violent pointless ****house movies such as Sin City and the likes, I guess this just highlights that there must be fairly big problems in our society today, why would anyone find this sort of negative and pointless junk enjoyable? The way that this sort of thing is portrayed in movies as being ""cool"" is really quite sickening, I wonder how many people who have had personal experience with murder and violence would find this sort of thing enjoyable, not many I would say. If you think you are going to get anything worthwhile out of this movie think again, your life will not be enriched in any way by watching this, spend the three hours out enjoying the sunshine or talking to your friends and family or something instead..."
5327,False,"Terrible... Just terrible. Nauseatingly dull and exceedingly over-hyped. Honestly I could never even think to sit through any of Diane Keaton's acting in my life it is so horrid. Possibly the worst acting that I have ever even witnessed! (Let me tell you I mean that about every single person that is in this film).I wouldn't even consider writing any more review for such a scathing, vile film of nothingness. Evil movie, don't open this. Do not watch this. Do not speak its words. If I could take back any of the time that I spent watching this movie then I would, because I feel as if a piece of my hollow soul has been torn from my within, and that it is not something that I could ever have back."
5328,False,"Okay so when I watched this film on Sunday before I had any idea what horrible pile of poop this was going to be, I thought too my self ""this could be my favourite movie"". Well it turned out to be nothing more then the most boring piece of flying poop I've seen in my life. The acting is mediocre at best and the pace of the movie never changes, its just slow slow slow. Jesus Christ, I really couldn't care if all of the actors died in the movie since I had absolutely no interest in it. The movie too me was so boring and bland that It took me over a week to watch it since its pace is incredibly slow and it never changes. The best part of the movie was when it showed the credits and ended, I said to my self ""Thank god this fail is over"" Quote on quote. Anyways to sum it up don't watch this over rated piece of icky buffalo poop that a skunk died on if you know what a good movie is."
5329,False,"Heady, scalding adaptation of Mario Puzo's bestselling book about Italian Mafia family as seen through many years time. Flawless production design and palpably tense, prickly atmosphere are two of the picture's many riches, and indeed Marlon Brando's performance as the family patriarch is an incredible characterization, though several of the other characters don't always come off and the repellent violence is occasionally presented in a ham-fisted manner (with too much wicked glee behind the bloodshed). Francis Ford Coppola directed the proceedings like someone who has lived and breathed this material, and he doesn't allow his love for movie-making magic to cloud the realism of this family's dark dealings, but he perhaps allowed the cast too much free reign and some sequences tend to ramble. Won Oscars for Brando as Best Actor (he refused it), Coppola and Mario Puzo for their adapted screenplay and for Best Picture. Followed by two Coppola-directed sequels in 1974 and 1990. *** from ****"
5330,False,"After seeing this movie numerous times I have to say that overall I find it highly overrated.  It is definately well crafted and the acting is superb. However the pacing is dreadfully slow at times and while I think overall the acting is strong it does get a little overblown at times.  Definately one of the best movies in its genre, unfortunately imho its not a genre with many good films."
5331,False,"Well, sitting back and watching objectively as I could, I saw The Godfather for the first time last night.I thought that since there is so much reference to this movie in comedy, drama, satire etc, that there must be some substance.Sadly not really. How this movie got to the top of the 250 is a mystery I'll never understand. Even Citizen Kane is a better view than this item.Perhaps this film was groundbreaking in its day, but frankly, Marlon Brando was laughable (as usual), the characters were stereotypical (though I guess they are the model for a generation of stereotypes that came after), and the story unremarkable. Kind of like the Thorn Birds meets Married To The Mob.That said, the film was OK. I gave it 7/10, but it got an extra point or two for having influenced so many other movies.Give me the Sopranos any day."
5332,False,"This movie was not #1 of the top 250 worthy. It was not the greatest film of all time. Even though, I did enjoy watching this, I would only give the a 6.2/10. If you are dying to see this, don't. It's not that great, even though it's not the worst film ever."
5333,False,this movie was horrible i don't understand how this is a good movie. Al Pacino's worst movie. Marlon Brando was horrible. So many people say how good this is but i think this movie should be burned. Francis ford Coppola is a bad director. Goerge Lucas is the best director ever. I'd give this movie a 3.0 on a 10 scale. The best movie in the world is easily material girls. Hilary duff is so hot in that movie. The screen play was bad the acting was bad and the director was bad. A movie you should see is Material girls the best movie ever. Good directing screenplay and defiantly acting. Another good movie was From Justin to Kelly. Justin is hot in his swimsuit but Kelly needs to lose pounds.
5334,False,"I watched this film because it had a high user rating. I don't get why people find it a good film. For me, it was just a film about people, a family, killing other people. I couldn't take much more away from it than that, sorry. Shawshank is a much better film in every respect. The Godfather is long and drawn out and although it is one of the better gangster films, I would have to say that it is not one that I will watch again. Please let there be someone that agrees with me. From the reviews that I have read there doesn't seem to be a good reason to suggest why this film is voted number one, something that really puzzles me. There are no twists, little to think about, and the film hardly makes you feeling better at the end of it, does it? I've seen much better films than the Godfather although I'm sure, as I seem to be going against popular opinion, I will get heavily criticized for these comments."
5335,False,"The Godfather is probably the most overrated movies of all time. I don't see why everyone gives this movie such a high rating. The movie sucks. The movie is just so darn boring and the only reason I kept watching it was because I kept wanting it to get better. I know a movie is not all about action, but come on, who wants to watch a movie that is just all talk and no action. Look at Scarface and The Untouchables, those were good Mafia movies. They both had a great storyline, great acting, and had at least some action. The Godfather is just way to boring and I don't get why it is number on the all time list. Some reviews that didn't like this movie have said many people like this movie because its about the Mafia and its influence. Those people who have said that are absolutely right. The only reason I don't give this movie a 1 is because Marlon Brando and Al Pacino's performances were pretty darn good, but the story itself which carry's the movie is just so darn boring and this is without a doubt the most overrated movie ever. I'll stick to the Star Wars Saga instead of the Godfather Trilogy."
5336,False,"This entire series being a classic, I had to watch it. I regret all of it. It was 12-13 hours of my life that I won't get back.This movie is horrible. The plot moves slowly, drearily, and almost nothing happens. Audio is shabby, and understanding what is going on, and most crucially: WHY? is incredibly difficult. Keeping track of who is what guy is also difficult, as the names are rarely said; the lighting is poor, making this even worse. I didn't know who was who until the third movie, which I had to force myself to watch.As a classic, watch it. Doesn't mean you have to like it, but now you can say why you hated it, which is the best part for me."
5337,False,"First i thought that The men who stare at goats was bad and than i saw this..... VERY bad movie. I don't care how many people gave it a 10 (don't know why). I want to write my opinion. It is long, boring, a lot of talking, a lot families, names, doing ""buissnes"".... Did i mention that it is boring? The movie lacks a good storyline. It doesn't matter how good the actors are if the movie is not interesting at all. There is no comedy, there is very little action, drama (here and there somebody gets killed). I had better fun watching politicians than this.I just wasted 6 hours of my life. (together with the second part)Better watch Scarface, Casino or Reservoir Dogs. My other movies are Braveheart, Gladiator, Shawshank, Lethal weapon, Black hawk down...."
5338,False,its a bad movie i don't know why you liked it i don't know whats am writing but its a good idea he how are you ? lets go out sometime why ? i like you good for you and you thank you yeah thank me and me no just me oh you are long lets see what can i say about this i really don't want to say anything why i don't know just wanna write a review cause am god at it no am not Ho's am kidding yeah am sorry and you should be i don't know why i say that a lot but its a good story and its a bad movie really bad i heat this movie and i heat you all i love myself and my mom dad yeah was a good times i agree with me and me just me yeah he is a bad person and a good movie no its bad really bad i heat it so much i love Friends and myself yeah Jahfali he is a good person
5339,False,"Ten years ago when I watched this movie for the first time I had no knowledge of English and I was almost a kid. My first impression of the movie was that it was plain boring. I have just watched ""The Godfather"" again ten years later. I am about to be twenty-seven years-old and I am a professor of English as a second language in two universities of my country so I can no longer think that my impression of the movie is biased by my young age or my lack of understanding of English -oh, I also speak Italian by the way.This movie is simply way too overrated. I am not saying this is a bad movie but it does NOT deserve his current position as 2nd greatest movie of all times.If you have not watched this movie I invite you to do so and judge for yourself. If you have watched it already I would like for you to try and convince me that I am wrong. If you decide to do so, I would appreciate if you did it in a respectful way.Regards, MANIUIS."
5340,False,"The movie opens at Don Vito Corleone's (Marlon Brando) home in the 1950s. His daughter is being wed and the entire ""family"" has come to celebrate. Vito's son Michael (Al Pacino), the most ""Americanized"" of his immediate family, has rejected the traditions of his ancestors and joined the army. He has no plans of becoming an errand boy for his father.Michael's older brother Sonny (James Caan) is hot-headed and overzealous. He is next in line to inherit ""the throne"" from Don Vito, although Vito suspects perhaps that Sonny is too heated for his own good and will never make it on his own. An important scene in the film is when he belabors his son about correcting him in front of strangers.A plot emerges involving a corrupt policeman and a competing Mafia family, who try to assassinate Don Vito and successfully murder his eldest, Sonny. Michael steps in to avenge his father's death, but must then be sent off into exile in Sicily for a short period of time to avoid the authorities, leaving behind his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton), who wants to get married.In terms of acting, its strength lies in Brando, Caan and Pacino. Brando is perfect - his trademark ""soft mouth"" being inimitable - whereas Caan is very good at turning Sonny into a multi-dimensional character. Pacino is great and displays intelligence and a certain suave aura, which is vital to the character. This was a glimpse of Al Pacino the actor before he turned on the screaming switch.Francis Ford Coppola does a wonderful job behind the camera, which is more than can be said for his efforts within the last decade. Likewise the script by Coppola and Puzo is very well-written with impressive dialogue and conflicts of the characters.""The Godfather"" isn't exactly the *best* film ever made but it's certainly a great movie; a masterpiece that redefined epic cinema much in the same way ""Lawrence of Arabia"" did."
5341,False,"The Godfather is arguably the most over-rated movie ever made. To be fair it is a technical feast, with impressive period design, and the music is memorable, but nothing else is. Pacino is dull, Keaton is forgettable, Duvall goes through the motions, and the script lacks the punch it probably had in 1972. Goodfellas, in one movie, tells the same rise and fall story that The Godfather has over three movies in a far more enjoyable and vivid way."
5342,False,"I expected a lot of this film especially after this was ranked as one of the best films. But to give it #1 ranking is way too much. I watched it and it was an OK film. The portrayal was real but a little too slow at times. Reality they say bites and I guess it was more like a documovie that chronicles the life of a mafia and his family. Facts were not the problem here, the speed was. I could find little that was debatable or something like that, just that it made me sleep. The sequel was no better in working as a sleeping pill."
5343,False,"What can I say about this film? In my opinion it's the best film ever made in movie history. Everything in it is perfect, the elements are combined in a brilliant way, and the result is a beautiful piece of art, a masterpiece. My rating is 10 of 10."
5344,False,"I do not understand the big fuss about the Godfather trilogy OK yes the acting is top quality with brilliant performances from marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and even talia Shire is good but the film just drags the whole story is boring and the films just seem to go over the same things over and over again.I must admit that i am probably not the best person to review the godfather seeing as i don't really like gangster movies i didn't like Goodfellas either although i did like like the untouchables I believe people saying they love the godfather movies is simply because they have heard other people saying how good it is and think that in order to be considered a proper movie lover they have to like the godfathers."
5345,False,"Godfather has a epic soundtrack. I am sure that someone who has a little knowledge about movies, is privy to this OST. It is a masterpiece for sure.The first time I watched this movie I had a 2 CD version of it. The second CD was broken/scratched and I really was so bored that I did not consider to watch this part on stream. I don't know why this movie is so high rated even if my father likes this movies.I do not blame anyone for watching this series of Godfather but those who watched it, cannot tell why they like this movies either. By the way I have watched every film starring Al Pacino and these are the only I could not finish at all! It has a very long, uninteresting and well known story which has a high budged. If you don't believe me, ask your friends who watched it. You will see what I am trying to tell because they only will tell you: ""Well.. it is.. just watch it! It's a great movie""."
5346,False,"Having seen this movie many years ago I sat to re-engage and watched again. I cannot understand the hype about this movie. I think that people hear that its the best movie made then automatically accept this opinion and convince themselves it is. The scene with the horses head was ridiculous really. Acting by Brando was at best mediocre and James Caan is useless . I don't even reckon FFC as a director either, especially after Gangs Of New York. If this was made in present day it would probably flop. The 2 sequels got worse and the supporting characters never seemed to fit in.I would imagine the book is a million times better. The only redeeming feature for me was seeing Al Pacino honing his acting skills he used so brilliantly used in the later Serpico and Scarface. Sorry but this never gripped me at all.Am I right in thinking Brando changed his looks,size and accent many times during this?"
5347,False,"Brando and Pacino share the lead in this masterpiece based on screenwriter Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name, about the boss of an organized crime family gradually transferring control of his business to his son, a war hero who never had any interest in following in his father's footsteps. Pacino's transformation from a black-sheep to a ruthless Mafia boss is so slick that it's worth every second of the film's epic length, while Brando's iconic delivery as the legendary Don Vito Corleone is literally untouchable and indisputably one of cinema's greatest performances. Definitely a film that might need one or two replays before being fully appreciated, but it is a classic for all the right reasons. Followed by a must-see second installment two years later, which is arguable even better than this perfect picture! Direct Coppola co-wrote the script.**** (out of four)"
5348,False,"It's really hard to argue against this film as the greatest of all time. The Godfather is one of those rare instances where incredible plot meets incredible interpretation. It has Iconic performances to iconic characters. Dialogues that are bursting with quotes, style, and even wisdom. Themes that resonate immediately with anyone: family, loyalty, honor, power, revenge, legacy. Etc.The story is essentially an emotional tragedy sprinkled with humor/fun. It makes us feel for this family. Moments of warmth if you will, largely thanks to characters like Vito (warmth) or Sonny (humor). As such we feel more impact when family members make mistakes that effect the whole. There's also something special about how the film interacts with the viewer, and it's hard to exactly explain what it is; it's an unusual tone. I guess it has something to do with how it all mixes: the superb acting, the almost-strange-but-beautiful camera shots, the haunting music. I would argue that it makes the film as a whole haunting.It's just damn perfect."
5349,False,"Does anyone ever asked the question about what is the best movie ever made? The movie that never get wrong in conveying its history and get right on all the points? The film that is very close to the word ""perfection""? Well, ""The Godfather"" parts 1-2-3 are undoubtedly the answer to this question. Separate the 3 movies and judge them separately is easy. Of course the 1st is where we get marveled, and the other two we had already noted some mistakes, but that's why the three movies together are not only a masterpiece from Francis Ford Coppola but also (perhaps) the best story ever told in a movie.While in the 1st part, we are introduced to the Italian mob-family the Corleone's facing various threats from rival mob-families. That forces Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) tries to push his youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), to be his successor and be the next family's godfather; In part 2, we have the exact continuation of the story of Michael in the power of the family trying to raise the family business to other countries but he ends up making mistakes along the way. And simultaneously, we have the story of the young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) showing how he came to America and started raising his family; And finally the 3rd and last part we see a older Michael Corleone, suffering from mistakes that he committed in the past. But now he tries to redeem himself before his children Anthony (Franc D' Ambrosio) and Mary (Sofia Coppola) and his family trying to finally legalize the family business going into business with the Vatican and elect his nephew Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) as the new family godfather. But the dangers have always followed the Corleone's closely.As I said, all parts form the masterpiece that Mario Puzo (Screenwriter) and Francis Ford Coppola (director and screenwriter) brought to the world with his vision of the Italian mafia. Many criticize the film by worshiping the Italian Mafia, which it technically does, but the way that both genius explore it is fantastic.Throughout the history of the Corleone's, Coppola and Puzo explore the life and business of the mafia and how it works, demonstrating the business and the wars between the Mafia families that are shown realistically and terrifying. BUT, it is not just a story of violence and tragedy as many accuse (which is 60 % of it), because as the film progress it raises throughout the history various concepts of honor, justice and family, all revolving around the Corleone. Making the public really feel part of the family and start to worry about each family member in all parts of the story, at the same time with the family business and his honor.The writing from Puzo and Coppola help much in this regard. The script is extremely ""perfect"" in all parts. The narrative is so superb that it never gets boring or leave loose ends, and always raise the values of honor and family through the best dialogs ever put on film. But Puzo and Coppola can make these long dialogs in simple conversations between human beings facing their problems, putting ourselves in their situations and relating with them, leaving the film more exciting and engaging.But Coppola not only explores the Italian mafia and their families but also puts at various points in American history: the first part is right after the 2nd World War and Michael is a war hero returning home, but he ends up becoming the godfather from his family; on the 2nd part in the history of young Vito Corleone we see him coming in America at the time of the great Italian immigration meeting the ""American Dream""; on the 3rd part with Michael going into business with the Vatican we see a huge line of corruption and murder within the church .Both in writing and directing the film is excellent too but the performances are the highlights of the movie: Al Pacino is excellent in every detail with a penetrating gaze and frightening expressions (and still annoys me that in 3 films he didn't get a Oscar for his role); Robert De Niro is a perfect young Vito Corleone in both voice and gestures reminding us of the badass and unforgettable old man from the first part with a simply perfect performance from Marlon Brando.Many say that the 3rd part should never be connected to the first two for be to horrible. I think the film is still a masterpiece but obviously it has his inconveniences leaving loose ends like: what happened with Tom (Robert Duvall), the family's lawyer, he died or he started his own family as he wanted in part 2? And also adds a lot of plots and little development, at least in the 1st hour of the film. But after a huge chopper scene everything settles superbly and concludes the trilogy or rather the film perfectly.Simply putted is the best movie ever made, the drawbacks and inconveniences are almost invisible (except in the 3rd part). Concepts of honor and family within the Mafia; full of suspense and drama; criticizes America and the church. All this in a movie with excellent performances, direction and writing simply perfect. All that makes ""The Godfather"", the strongest brand of cinema till today10/10"
5350,False,"One of the classic movies and one of my favorites movie of all time is ""The Godfather"". It is a movie that show us how are the things in mafia from an inside look. In this movie you will understand how things work in mafia and which is the followed hierarchy. Marlon Brando made on of his best performances of his entire career as Don Vito Corleone and it seemed as he had won the Oscar for the Best Actor in a Leading Role in 1973. You will also love the performance of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone (Nominated for Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role).""The Godfather"" is a movie that you must see and I strongly recommend it to you and I am sure that you will rate it with a 10/10."
5351,False,"THE GODFATHER of all Gangster movies is an understatement for the line 'THE GODFATHER of all movies'. You won't miss any element of a great movie in this. Two greatest actors from Hollywood (Brando & Pacino) and a director whose fame is worldwide. The two lead actors were actually chosen instead of Redford and Olivier for various reasons.There were lots of budget issues while producing this movie but Coppola handled them absolutely well. Apart from production cost, he had to handle few supporting cast who weren't actually actors but gangsters.The director did say in an interview that he had tough time asking a character to read a sentence in English.There are at least dozen movies (in my country alone) which inspired/copied this epic.So, the bottom line is if you haven't watched this yet then get a copy now."
5352,False,"What a movie this is? Like a ride and a half. Only coming to view it again last year, after last seeing it, I'd say, early 1990, late 89' this movie I've watched a few more times, again the other night, has grown on me. It's undoubtedly a masterpiece that deserves it's place of respect as one of the great movies of all time. Ironically the film was on GO the night after I've video'd it again. That just shows ya, what a classic this is. They don't make films like this anymore. The acting is high calibre. I loved James Caan in this as the hot headed brother who meets his demise in one of three bloody scenes, the most notably of course, that horrifyingly violent scene with the horse head, in the bed of a movie producer refuses to play ball. If you want a favor, like a wrong to be righted, talk to the Godfather, (an unparalleled performance by the late great Marlon Brando, who died penniless at 145 k's-hard to believe) can solve all your problems. Brando in this, just shows ya as in other films like Apocalypse Now, he's just the consummate actor. He must of inspired so many wannabe's. Of course the great discovery of a young talent, who soon would become an acting legend/role model, was of course Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone who when we first meet him, he's not part of his mafia family. In fact, he somewhat despises it. It's the choice he makes later on, after a near death experience with a loved one, where in his eyes, payback is warranted, even though, he quotes ""Never personal"". He becomes one of them, after brazenly taking out a crooked cop, and the head of another mafia family, responsible for the execution on his father, Don Corleone, (Brando), a tough cookie, surviving five close shots. What resilience this guy has, proving some guys are just lucky, or hard to kill. All the emotions, Pacino shows, nervousness, agitation, as he braces himself to make his first kills, were so believably intense, not overacted, just nice, perfect even. Pacino then vacates to Sicily for a year, to wait for the heat to cool down, where he marries a Sicilian beauty. I couldn't believe Diane Keaton, always terrific, and so good (fine) in this, escaped an Academy award nomination. She was just as good as most of the excellent leads. Watching Caan kick the crap out of his sister's abusive husband, was a guilty viewing pleasure. Caan really impressed me here. I won't tell you the last scene of this movie, but it involves a big fat lie, from Pacino, when asked a one time question by Keaton, which impactfully stayed with me, where if I was Pacino, for me, answering ""Yes"", would be an impossibility. There's some things you don't see coming in The Godfather, and the story takes different paths throughout the film. The cinematography is of course, first rate, and I love the interior shots in the Don's office, and again, here's a mafia film, that has me craving Italian. Although it's occasionally violent, most of it's pretty graphic too, oh that blood so under colored, more orangy red, flowing, it will always stand as the no one mafia film. God help us, if something of it's ilk, better's it."
5353,False,"People say this movie is one or even the best movie of all time I can't really understand why. I did not go in for very high expectations so I thought that after I had watched this movie my mind would be blown but it wasn't and thats really sad. This movie was really original but it doesn't and it helps this movie a lot still this movie is very overrated. I have not read the book. This movie compared to The Dark Knight Trilogy is I'm sorry to say it but a joke. It's not really worth watching it feels like what was the purpose of this movie? To see the underworld? The last 15 minutes are the best thing in this movie but you really got to ask yourself is it worth watching a movie that is 175 minutes long for 15 minutes? The actors was outstanding but so are the ones in as an example The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception or Lord of The Rings Trilogy. When I was going to see Looper I came in with the same expectations but but my mind was blewn! Looper had a purpose but The Godfather didn't. Sorry to all of you who think that your going to see the best movie ever but this is not the one, go see Lord of The Rings Trilogy there you have a masterpiece!"
5354,False,"The beginning of a movie always sets the tone. Same goes for this movie here. And watching this you can understand how this influenced the TV show ""Sopranos"". But back to the first scene. It involves the Godfather character who has to talk to people on the wedding day of his daughter, because it is tradition. The way it is filmed and lit is exceptional. The tone is set in more than one settings. Because you also get what the movie is about: Respect, Fear and Power.Some of which get achieved by manipulation, convincing (in more than one way) or buy-out. What lies above all? A thing the Godfather always tells his children (or his lawyer)? Family is what matters. The movie does hold up to the test of times. You might have seen movies that have more violence in them, but when this movie gets violent it doesn't hold back.The performances are awesome and I can't wait to listen to the audio commentary by Mr. Coppola (which is supposed to be controversial, I'll see about that). So re-watching the movie reminded me of how good it is. But also of how much I miss the Sopranos. One of most known little facts of the movie, Marlon Brando stuffing his cheeks, make you look at the movie differently too. It still takes nothing away from it of course. Exceptional in every sense, even if you don't agree with the way the ""family"" functions (and you shouldn't agree with it of course, just saying)"
5355,False,"The question everyone will likely ask me upon viewing the lengthy and heavily-celebrated Godfather I will not answer. That question is ""is it really the greatest film of all time?"" I can't answer it. I'm in no position to, nor have I seen every film ever made to correctly state that. How can you say what the greatest film of all time is if you haven't seen literally every film ever made? That question will never be answered. If you polled a million people, the question would still be answered with subjectivity. There is no possible way to define what is the greatest film of all time without any subjective input. It can't be done.I will say The Godfather is an important film. Perhaps the greatest, but definitely one of the most important in the history of the art form. Its depiction of the mob, to my knowledge, is dead on, and runs like a stage play or opera at opus length. It is three hours long, and I recommend two or even three sittings before you finish it. To take it in all in one sitting is difficult, not just because of length, but because of content. It is five minutes shy of three hours and feels every bit as long. It's not a problem, since the film immerses you with intricate visuals, dialog, and its casual glide of events, but it makes for a sometimes testing excursion.Everyone knows the story, so I won't go into it. Basically, we follow the Corleone family, an Italian mob run by Don Vito, played with unmatchable talent by Marlon Brando, after his daughter Connie (Shire) is married to Carlo Rizzi (Russo). After that, we see dramatic events following the wedding and run-ins with other gang outlets, fights, and lengthy monologues involving the family.I grew up on Scorsese's mob flicks, and one who has will find a grand difference between Scorsese's portrayal of mob life and Francis Ford Coppola's portrayal. For one, Scorsese's mob films, of course we're primarily speaking of Goodfellas, were more about exploiting the lifestyle, with an outsider looking into the action, who would eventually become one of them. In contrast, Coppola brings us right into the lifestyle, not from an outsider's perspective, but from the perspective of many different family members. Don Corleone is not the main character in the film. Nor is Carlo Rizzi. Surprisingly, Al Pacino's Michael is the one who lifts most of the picture off the ground in terms of characters.Pacino is outstanding. Every scene he's in, he possesses an undeniable screen presence that is equal parts ominous and electrifying. Brando brings a unique sense of direction to the screen as well. He seems calmer, more confident than any mob boss I've seen portrayed before. It doesn't seem like he needs to hammer home the idea he is the boss. He believes without a shadow of a doubt everyone knows it, and if they don't, they soon will.The Godfather, like many classics, shows signs of age. It has a dated look to it, where all its colors appear to be washed out. It doesn't bother me, but I've heard others complain heavily. Some even find it to be ""overrated"" and boring. I don't really see it as that, mainly because I can see what makes the film top many ""best film"" lists. It has tremendous writing, intricate, serious directing from Coppola, gifted performances, and some of the most impressive cinematography, evoking seriousness, atmosphere, and detail to perhaps the sternest extent.But I can see people being underwhelmed because of one inevitable outlet; pop culture and media. The Godfather has to be one of the most parodied films of all time, with lines, events, and monologues tempered with and mocked in frequent TV shows, movies, and even children's shows. I did a short film in high school about ""The Doughnut Godfather,"" where a student dressed up in a fancy suit, put on a luxurious hat, and had a stuffed cat sit on his lap. This could very well make the film lose its serious aspect to some because immediately when we hear the line ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse,"" we divert our thoughts to where we've heard that before.Another big difference I noticed between Scorsese and Coppola's work is that Scorsese's mobster films are more about history, rather than characters. We do get heavy characterization, but each films seems to have a great deal of respect for mob history and real life events. Coppola focuses a lot more on characterization and performances, as well as creating vignettes involving the Corleone family, showing family meetings and murders. When we look back at Goodfellas, we do think performances, but we more or less think of events that shocked and surprised us. When we think Godfather, we immediately reminisce about the extremely involved and award-worthy performances.This could very well be one of the greatest films I've ever seen, but again, who am I to judge? My job is to say if I enjoyed a film and do I see audiences liking it. I'm sure many, if not every person, reading this review has seen The Godfather, and if not, then they have an extra task on their list. Unfortunately, some won't see the beauty because so many grittier mobster films have come out, that don't involve heavy monologues and intricate performances, and pop culture has greatly subtracted the impact the film once had. This shows gangsters in a different light. Ones that don't feel the need to boast power or success. They know you already know what they've done just by how they speak, act, and move.Starring: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton. Directed by: Francis Ford Coppola."
5356,False,"Black screen. Cue the lone trumpet's haunting opening notes of Nino Rota's theme. Close up of a suffering man. ""I believe in America."" That, my friends, is a powerful opening to a truly great film.It's been 40 years since it's original release, and this latest remastering looked and sounded amazing on Cinemark's largest screen. Following those opening moments, we get our first look at Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone. On this screen, it was almost like seeing him for the first time ... a disquieting figure that oozes power and demands respect.There is no need for another review of this truly classic American film. Instead, this will offer a few observations (possible spoilers) and notes of interest ... combined with the highest possible recommendation to watch this one again!At its core, author Mario Puzo's story is about power, loyalty, trust and family. We witness what happens when one is viewed as having too much power. Loyalty is rewarded, and disloyalty brings the harshest possible penalty. Trust is gained over time, but lost in a flash. And family is the most complex subject of all.Over the years, there have been a few movies with more star-studded casts, but it's difficult to imagine a more perfectly selected cast: Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Richard Conte, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda. Each of these actors have graced the screen in numerous roles, but for this three hour film, they become Corleones, associates, enemies, etc. There were a few things that jumped out at me during this viewing. The use of oranges (the fruit) contradicts the health benefits preached by the medical profession. Every time we see a bowl of fruit, a fruit stand or someone peeling, eating, or selecting an orange, a scene of doom (usually quite violent) is soon to follow. Carlo is even wearing an orange suit when Sonny (James Caan) shows up and paints the sidewalk with him. Don't miss the billboard featuring oranges that Sonny drives by just before he pulls up to the toll booth. Brando's final scene is preceded by him playfully scaring his grandson with an orange peel. I understand the importance of Vitamin C, but I think I'll stick with supplements!It's very interesting to note the camera angles throughout the movie. In an unusual approach, director Francis Ford Coppola uses an ""eye-level"" camera almost exclusively. This gives the viewer the feeling of being part of the scene, especially during the small group meetings within Corleone's dimly lit office. The few exceptions are the overhead shot of Corleone being shot, the Los Angeles cityscape, and a couple of shots at the wedding to emphasize the scale of the event.The famous ""Mattress Sequence"" was put together by George Lucas (Star Wars fame) for his friend Coppola. This is the segment after the Louis Restaurant shooting where we get a montage of B&W crime photos and newspaper headlines. These are real life crime photos and one of the shots is of Frank Nitti, Al Capone's trusted enforcer.It's quite fascinating to recognize how many ""classic"" lines of dialogue sprung from the movie, especially when you notice the minimalistic approach to dialogue used by Puzo and Coppola. Much of the communication is non-verbal body language, glances, nods and shrugs ... Brando, especially, is a master at this.One of the more remarkable facets of the film is the transformation of Michael (Al Pacino). We first see him as a dashing war hero relaxing at the wedding with his girlfriend (a baby-faced Diane Keaton). He is very laid back and kind of cocky with the thought that he can rise above the dirty family business. He sees himself as better than that. Watch the subtle changes in his appearance ... his hair, his posture, his eyes, even his hat! As great as Brando is as the Don, it's Pacino's performance that really takes the film to an unprecedented level. It's really fun to compare Michael's even-keeled, calm processing approach to the high-strung, act-now-think-later approach of his brother Sonny.The final note involves actor John Cazale. Here (and in part 2) he plays Fredo as a frightened, insecure puppy who is desperate to find his place. Imagine your father being Vito Corleone and your brothers are Sonny and Michael. It's to be expected that you might be overlooked and overpowered in conversation. The really interesting note about Cazale is that this was his feature film debut. He went on to make 4 more films before cancer took his life in 1978. Cazale made 5 films and all 5 were nominated for Best Picture (both Godfather films, The Conversation, Dog Day Afternoon, The Deer Hunter). He was engaged to Meryl Streep at the time of his death.So the real point here is that if you ever doubt the magic and power of movies ... shut off your phone, close the blinds, take the cannoli, and let The Godfather absorb your thoughts. While you are at it, remember ... it's not personal, it's business (only you shouldn't really believe that).Thanks to Cinemark for making me an offer I couldn't refuse."
5357,False,"It's a difficult word to cope with. It's a word that I try to toss around as little as possible. But there's just no other word. The Godfather isn't necessarily my favorite film of all time, it's not necessarily the best film of all time, but it's just that: perfect.Very few films can make this claim; very few films work on every possible level, on every aspect of the art of cinema, with every line and every shot perfectly placed, none wasted, none too fast, none too slow. The Godfather is a film that takes its time, sometimes moving slowly, but never so slowly that it loses momentum; it's a film that's incredibly rich and full of emotion and symbolism, but it's also very entertaining.In the music - Nino Rota's score compliments every scene its in, immerses the viewer, never distracting but always a part of the atmosphere, so that whenever you'll hear it a scene from the film will immediately come to mind.In the editing - it can be very simple at times, and very intense at others - like the baptism scene near the end. It can be slow and tense, it can be calm and euphoric, and it can also be bloody violent.In the cinematography - the lighting is never coincidental, always complimenting the mood of the scene, the coloring always expressive and always of importance.In the acting, of course - The Godfather boasts a supergroup of actors, and almost all of them pull their most impressive performance here - Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton... this is to the credit of Francis Ford Coppola who drove the actors to these performances as much as the actors themselves.There is no film better than The Godfather. There may be films that are more complex, more original - The Godfather's tale, beneath the complexity of dozens of characters, is a simple story of family, honesty, morality, loyalty and family... most of all family. Even Part II can be seen as more sophisticated than the first film - but it's not 'better', because unlike The Godfather, Part II has flaws, small as they may be.If you love movies - watch The Godfather. Whether or not you're interested in crime fiction, watch it. If you just want a good piece of entertainment, watch it too. It's a rare accomplishment - it's a film of quality that may be equaled, but can never be surpassed."
5358,False,"There was a time in Hollywood, mostly during the 1960s, where the great motion picture factory lost its way a bit. We saw the rise of the pretentious independent production, and what studio output there was might be eye-catching but lacking in the old magic. Above all they had lost touch with the professionalism that characterised the industry back in its heyday. At last, in the early 70s, the younger generation of filmmakers began to grow up and Hollywood started to get its act together again. The Godfather is one of its great comeback pictures.Why has The Godfather become such a giant of cinema? Its story has no great emotional weight, no laugh-out-loud comedy, no rip-roaring action, no thrilling suspense. But it is, quite simply, a perfectly written drama. The screenplay adapted by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola from Puzo's novel is a great study of power because it takes a bunch of ruthless mob bosses going about their business, but shows their humanity through their reverence for the family, without ever once losing sight of their amoral coldness. It hooks us instantly with the power of that thought, so much so that it can afford to devote a major portion of its length (a full forty minutes of screen time, from the opening wedding to the notorious horse's head incident) merely introducing us to the way the Corleone world works, before even getting onto the real storyline. The fact that it can do this and still hold our interest shows the solidity of its ideas and characterisation.The Godfather also sees director Coppola at his very best. Coppola has a lot in common with an ace director of the previous generation, the consistently brilliant William Wyler, especially in his approach to actors. Like Wyler, Coppola fully understands that an acting performance is comprised of many facets ¬ñ voice, facial expression, body language, distance from the audience ¬ñ and a director can choose which to show and which not to show, to varying effect. Take that masterful opening shot ¬ñ we are introduced to the eponymous Godfather in a slow zoom out, gradually revealing his bulky figure dominating the foreground, his back to the audience. This establishes the character as an intimidating presence ¬ñ no face to be seen as yet. When we do see his face the dimness of the interior makes his stern expression all the more formidable for how hard it is to read. Even when we see him in brighter surroundings with the other wedding guests it is from an objectively distant crane shot. It is only later in the picture that he becomes human to us, and we get to see a little true emotion and softness in his face.Which of course brings us round to the sterling work of Marlon Brando. True to the gradual revelation of his character, he presents the Don as some kind of monster, with a face like a bulldog and a voice like an alcoholic with throat cancer. But, as over time we see the man showing tenderness for his offspring or torn up with grief, he manages to twist that ugly face into very real expressions. The effect is almost a little like the emoting of Boris Karloff as the Monster in Frankenstein. There is all-round good stuff from the rest of the cast as well. Al Pacino in particular has this brilliantly passive, steely air about him, and the dispassionate way he does everything is a sublime bit of understatement.When it came to the Oscars, The Godfather of course scooped Best Picture, but it lost most of the awards to one of the other amazing pictures of the early 70s, Cabaret, for which Bob Fosse won the Best Director prize. It seems odd to me, as I feel had the two pictures (or their equivalents) been around twenty years earlier Cabaret, which gives the greatest all-out entertainment, would have been Best Picture, while Coppola would have got Best Director for his intelligent helming of The Godfather. I guess a lot of this has to do with the auteur theory effect, and a general forgetting of just what it is a director does. Thus Fosse's colourful choreographing of cast and camera won over Coppola's subtle thoughtfulness in framing and staging. Still, regardless of what awards it did and didn't get, The Godfather was a real prize for the industry, proving at last that Hollywood was back on top."

5360,False,"My father made me watch this with him when I was 17. At first I was put off by the seemingly slow pace. But gradually the vast canvas and the gorgeous visuals began to draw me in. I had never expected that an 'old' film would be so beautiful to look at. At the end my father asked me what I thought of it. I replied that it was 'bigger' than anything I had ever seen before, but I also felt that it lacked depth. Thats when my father hit me with it : he pointed out for my benefit that ""you're not allowed to have an opinion on this film."" At 17, I used to think that having an opinion about something was a democratic and reasonable thing.With this film, Coppola managed to articulate notions & myths about the Italian Mafia, notions that had existed for decades but had never been so artistically depicted before, at least not in films. No mainstream picture before had ever depicted the mafia in anything deeper than black-&-white stereotypes of good and evil. The production design, photography, the performances and Nino Rota's score are so perfectly welded together that you never doubt for a moment that the world within the film EXISTS.I'm sure intellectuals have a field day with this film. A psychologist would detect seething undercurrents of homoeroticism, combined with a feudal & patriarchal mindset. A film analyst would probably criticise the straightforward storytelling style, as opposed to a twisting & warped narrative format of the noir convention, where the viewer changes what is viewed. A philosopher would berate the film for having no depth or inherent meaning, and its characters for lacking any real consciousness of themselves or the world. The film has one singular idea : the rationalizing of murder by calling it ""business, not personal"", which is appalling.I still think this is the best monument of popular culture, over time as well as place. It is the ultimate elevation of style over substance, but undeniably the film is tastefully made. There are moments in this film that nobody forgets : the opening marriage scene, the decapitated horse, the meeting of the five families, and of course every single scene that Marlon Brando is in. To my mind, the Godfather is probably the best compromise we've yet seen between art and commerce."
5361,False,"I will keep my review to a minimum as so much has been written on this film. It is a fantastic film (up there with Once Upon a Time in the West as one of the greatest of all). I watched it again for the 8th time after not seeing it for 5 years or so, and had forgotten just how immersive the film is. My only negative comment, and I add this as I haven't heard this criticism before, is that this is one of the few films that would benefit from being a little longer. At times the film cuts between scenes too quickly and speeds through threads looking almost cartoony, which is at odds with the general mood of the film of a slow relaxed immersive experience. In particular consider when Tom visits Hollywood to get Johnny Fontane a role. The sequence seems almost rushed as one minute Tom is in NY then LA and then cut, cut, cut suddenly there's a horse's head.. This happens a number of times in the film and probably resulted from studio pressure to reduce the film's running length. Overall though a masterpiece."
5362,False,"I had heard a lot about this epic masterpiece for so many years and so I tried to get a DVD copy or catch a T.V premiere or any possible way.Finally,the wait was over.And to my surprise it was worth the waitThe movie is not your usual type of movie.Its got brains,guts and glory all over it.The performances are extraordinary from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino.You will have a great time watching this movie as every aspect of the movie is just perfect right from the acting department to the cinematography department.I am very happy to have lived to this day to have watched the best cinematic experience ever.......THE GODFATHER."
5363,False,"Well I'm 15 and saw this movie for the first time recently. I must say although it was well acted, written and directed; it was somewhat boring during some portions of the movie, and there were some points where i couldn't figure out what was going or why it was going on. This was sometimes caused by Brando's almost unintelligible mumbled accent (my only gripe with the acting). It seems like there was just a classic scene, then some boring filler, another memorable scene, then boring filler, and so on. All in all it's a good movie and worth watching.7/10 definitely a classic, just don't expect and edge of your seat action flick."
5364,False,"I realize that taste is subjective, but when I read the review of contributors to this site who pan great movies, I wonder about their IQ or their concept of quality. Unless they just love to type their venom on a page or have other emotional problems, it seems difficult for them to understand the quality of a movie Instead of saying: A lot of people like this film. It is the highest rated film in the database. Maybe I am missing something here. Maybe I do not understand what character development is all about. Perhaps I don't know good acting from bad. Maybe I do not like a certain actor and it is coloring my entire view of the movie. Maybe the movie offends my moral sense and therefore I cannot like it without subjecting my soul to hell.Or maybe, I cannot put myself in the context of the time the film was made. Sure, the phrase: 'I'll make him an offer he can't refuse!' is trite today. But it wasn't when the movie was made! Although the Mafia was not a new concept to most people, the idea that crime families lived like normal people was a revelation, taken one step further with 'The Sopranos.' Similarly, one cannot compare 'The Sands of Iwo Jima'with 'Saving Private Ryan.' Although both had good production values of their times, the technology of the 90's made Ryan seem to be a better picture. To summarize, before you consider yourself another Roger Ebert, read the reviews of the people who liked the movie and try to understand what they saw and why you did not fully appreciate it. Then, sit down at your computer and type, without ranting, a well reasoned critique that may be of use to others."

5366,False,"MOTION PICTURES having organized crime as the subject matter seem to be forever ""IN"" as fair game for a movie (""Film' if it's a special, 'Top-Shelf'production). In every era we have seen filmed stories of Gangland. Some have been factual(ST.VALENTINE'S MASSACRE), some 'loosely' based on factual material (AL CAPONE-Monogram 1959, THE UNTOUCHABLES-all incarnations) and then there are those that are all fictional(THE DON IS DEAD,THE LAST DON,DONDI).FINALLY we have a category which is fiction, but not strict fiction; being an original work which, while not being the representation of historical events, it contains fictional events that are inspired by real life occurrences.THIS is the type of storyline that makes for the best fiction; also this type is the one that makes and needs those disclaimers that appear in the either the opening or closing credits of a Feature Film or TV series episode that say something like: ""THE EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS FILM/TV EPISODE ARE FICTICOUS. NO COMPARISON TO REAL PERSONS, LIVING OR DEAD ARE INTENDED NOR SHOULD BE INFERRED."" TODAY'S honored/dissected film, MARIO PUZO'S THE GODFATHER(Alfan Productions/Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1972), is perhaps the best example of an exponent of this category of Gangster Film. While we all are aware that the story is not a true one; at the same time we also note that there are many characters and occurrences in the story, both in the book and on the screen, that were clearly either suggested by real people and actual incidents or were out and out caricatures of such.READILY we can identify fictional characters in the story that were doubtless obvious make-believe versions of denizens from our real world. The main character of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) seems to be a composite character; having taken certain characteristics from both Vito Genovese and Carlo Gambino, New York Underworld Big-Wigs both as well as Dons of two different 'Families'. Carlo Gambino even had been known as 'the Godfather'.ANY casual gambler or vacationer recognizes that the character of Moe Green, a Las Vegas Casino Operator closely corresponds to the profile of real-life Ben ""Bugsy"" Siegel; who was both an early advocate and promoter of investing in and expanding the already existing gambling in 'Sin City'.(Ben Siegel was portrayed by Warren Beatty in BUGSY (Baltimore Pic./Mullholland Prod./Dessert Vision/Tri-Star, 1991, but that's another story!) QUITE POSSIBLY the most obvious connection between the factual actual and the all made-up fictional lies in that of the fictional singer. 'Johnny Fontaine' (real life singer Al Martino) has the most widely held opinion of naming 'old blue eyes'(himself), Frank Sinatra as being the leading suspect.THERE is indeed many similarities both in Mr. Martino's characterization, as well as the story's references to ""That Movie Big Shot"" and Johnny Fontaine's not getting the part in the War Picture that he wanted.* But in the novel, the singer Fontaine has a Comedian Partner! Can you say Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis? Allen & Rossi? how about Brown & Carney, Wheeler & Woolsey, Clark & McCullough, Abott & Costello, Laurel & Hardy, Samson & Delilah, St. Paul & Minneapolis....ON a personal note; the reported indignation expressed by some Italian-American Civic groups over NBC's premiere network broadcast of the film seemed to be less serious than originally reported; as practically every Italian we ran into that day said something like, ""Hey! The Godfather's on tonight!"" AND in summary, we admit it, we love those Gangster Pictures. Most folks do. But our only real criticism of the Film and the Puzo Novel is that they both tend to raise the status of Don Corleone to that of being something that a real Gangland Boss would not ever be. By way of a comparison, let us just say that Vito's conscientious and benevolent characterization is an extreme and a sophomoric falsehood. It rings no truer than the persona given to mythical Nevada Senator Geary(G.D.Spradlin) as a completely evil, patently dishonest & ruthless louse in THE GODFATHER, PART II, (1974).NOTE * The references are thought by many to be of Frank Sinatra's getting the part in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY over Columbia Pictures Mogul Harry Cohn's preference for Eli Wallach. Maybe, but again, maybe not.AND remember, Schultz, the answer is no about the singer character. He was Johnny Fontaine, not Frank Fontaine (Crazy Googenheim in the Joe the Bartender segment of THE JACKIE GLEASON SHOW (CBS, 1960's)!)"
5367,False,"The era of the gangster arrived with the foundation of a strong individual who wanted to make all organized gangs subservient to a single power. Although the idea was not totally unique as some historians have accredited it to 'Legs Diamond, 'Dutch Shultzs or it might have originated with Mr. Maranzano, Masseria, Luciano or even Al Capone. Whoever the originator, the consensus leans towards a traditional Italian family which emigrated from Italy and who revised the custom in America of the secret society of 'Omerta.' Influenced by such a society, Mario Puzo developed a dramatic story called ""The Godfather"" about a successful Patriarch, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) from Italy who founded an Olive Oil business and expanded it into other less legitimate areas including, strong arm protection, extortion, prostitution and gambling. Now with the family's fortune expanding and gaining political influence as well, the head of the family wishes to transfer his power to his eldest son, 'Santino' Corleone (James Caan) and retire. However, a new opportunity arrives in the form of an Italian mobster named, Virgil 'The Turk' Sollozzo( Al Lettieri) who wants to start importing illegal drugs. Advised by his step-son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) that despite the danger, there is a fortune to be made in the trade. Refusing to get involved, the Don becomes a target for Emilio Barzini (Richard Conte) and other rival families and is plunged into a gang war, resulting in his own assassination and the attacks of many including his eldest son. That's when his youngest son Michael Corlone (Al Pacino) enters the family business and has a major task ahead. While this immense sage expands over the years and the American countryside, the family develops despite major setbacks, but as Michael promises, 'I'm gonna wait till I become a Godfather, then I will initiate my plan.' The movie has established itself as a monumental Classic and become immensely popular, spawning other similar films and catch-phrases such as ""I'm gonna make him an Offer, he can't refuse."" A dramatic action film which reminds us, a movie can make heroes as well as scapegoats out of arriving immigrants. ****"
5368,False,"Though totally fictional, there is a reality that is seen very little in films today, and the fact that this was made in 1972 makes it even more special.Before this film, from at least what I know, crime dramas involving organized crime have always made it black and white; crime was wrong no matter what the circumstances were.The complexity of a criminal being a truly honorable man (Vito Corleone), and his son (Michael) who has the greatest love for him is just remarkable. That being said, the irony of all that honor and love set inside a world of corruption and murder is very odd, but works quite well.What I liked about it was that they used situations from real cases, such as an infamous Italian diner scene in New Jersey being similar to the assassination of Joe ""The Boss"" Masseria made possible by ""Lucky"" Luciano."
5369,False,the godfather could be a symbol more than just a movie this is probably the best movie ever made and included the efforts of the best there was in Hollywood from Puzo to Brando to Al Pacino to the other giant names in Hollywood who remained till today symbols more than actorsthe story of the godfather is one of the greatest and the most complicated and gave a lot of insight to the way the mob men think and the kind of conspiracies they run in order to stay on topthe cast was one of a kind starting from the godfather Mr. Brando who made a hell of a job and earned his Oscar beautifully without doubt then to the marvelous Al Pacino who made a textbook job and going through most of the names Caan and Cazale and all the other well placed actors who made Mr. Puzo look good!the big star in this masterpiece was Mr. Coppola because this is a drama and in a drama the star is basically the director then comes every other name the music was one of a kind and till this day it is the favorite for many and was very wisely chosen to match the majestic appearances of the drama and the story and the eventsand finally the big tragedy which in this case was Al Pacino.. how come he did not get the Oscar??? this was one of the best performances in the history of Hollywood and still he did not get the Oscar..what a shame what a shameany way this did not affect the godfather in any way and is still the best movie ever made
5370,False,"Francis Ford Capolla's The Godfather is perfect, faultless and gripping. This film will really not stop sticking you to your chair. Al Pacino's second feature film and no doubt his best. His character is lovable and thrilling.It all begins when The Godfather (Marlon Brando) is granting favours, on the day of his daughters wedding. It is a tradition, not to deny a wish. Chaos is caused and problems occur. Problems which cause his oldest son Sunny (James Caan) to take over his role temporarily. Sunny, being the aggressive and annoyed one of all the sons. Causes something else to occur. Each problem causes another. The adopted son Tommy (Robert Duvall) is a lawyer and is capable of making a small portion of the problems disappear. This movie is literally gripping, no matter how tired or annoyed you are. This will still end up being your number one favourite movie; and Al Pacino is Michael, the youngest son, and probably his fathers favourite. He gives a perfect performance. With other brilliant actors through out the film (John Cazalle, Dianne Keaton) this film is, I will say it again, perfect! I STRONGLY recommend this movie to absolutely anyone and everyone. Most probably the best work of the brilliant director Franciss Ford Capolla.I give it a 110% and an 11 out of 10.PERFECT!"
5371,False,"I really don't know how else to summarize the review of such a perfect movie.""The Godfather"" is undoubtedly my favorite legitimate, serious attempt at film-making. Francis Ford Coppola's brilliant direction enhances performances from such top-quality actors as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and more.It is a violent, tense masterpiece, a movie in the small pantheon with ""Alexander"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (as well as the remainder of its own trilogy) that can hold your attention for three or more hours and never skew boring. If you're still unsure, pay attention to the squibs. Or the brilliantly natural production design. Or Gordon Willis's imaginative cinematography.Still not convinced? Just listen to this: it's much better than the book. ""The Godfather,"" while very brutal, is probably the greatest American cinematic masterpiece. And if you won't believe this reviewer, believe the people who exalted this film to a 9.1, making it the IMDb's highest-rated film. It is one of few movies on the Top 250 that deserves such a position."
5372,False,"The Godfather is placed near the top of any reliable best films list. It is an American classic based on Mario Puzo's novel and directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It recounts the ascent of Michael Corleone to the head of his crime family, originally headed by his father, ""the Godfather"" Don Vito Corleone. Don Vito is played by Marlon Brando in a key performance, which actually does not amount to all that much screen time (at least, relative to the whole film). The majority of the film focuses on Michael and his acquaintances trying to sustain an empire that satisfies their vision of an American dream.The film exhibits masterful quality in virtually every category. The acting is one of those key aspects. Although I'm not a fan of Al Pacino, his performance as Michael is unarguably a great achievement. Marlon Brando is even more iconic and unforgettable as Don Vito. Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton are good supporting actors. In addition, I think Sollozzo and the corrupt police captain are wrongly unappreciated as bad guys.The camera-work and direction is solid (although nothing groundbreaking). The music is fantastic. Although the main theme is most remembered, I believe the suspenseful music used to lead up to inevitable encounters is more important. It makes the tension come straight through the screen and into the audience.The movie is a little on the long side, but most of the time the scenes are completely engrossing. It would be difficult for anyone to argue that The Godfather is not a great film. While its not my favorite movie of all time, it deserves its place in critic lists. It is as near perfect a movie as you can expect a human to make."
5373,False,"This should have won the acadamy award for best movie ever made. It has awesome action. I think that everybody did a great job on it. Marlon Brandon deserved the Oscar he won. He did a great job on his role. My favorite character in the movie is James Cann's role ""Sonny Corleone"". He did a great job in it. Especially when he kicked Carlo's ass. Al Pacino also did a good job in it. I really liked him in this. It is my favorite role of his(this and Scarface).I believe Al Pacino should have won the Oscar for best actor in a supporting role. Francis Ford Copppla did a great job. He brought in great acting assemble for this movie. He pretty much started Al Pacino's amazing career. Everybody remembers James Cann for his role, and the same for Marlon Brando's role. CHICA CHICA YEAH!BJK"
5374,False,"I love this movie! I will gladly be the first to admit, that I have always been fascinated by the Mafia, and that particular lifestyle... It's an incredible ride! It will deliver every genre of film you could possibly want: Action, Drama, Comedy, Suspense, and Romance... The performances in this movie by Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and John Cazale are simply the best acting you will ever see... I've always said if I can't believe the actors in their roles, then I will not recommend the movie to someone, In The Godfather, Everyone performs their roles... Perfectly! I know this is a long movie, but trust me, I have seen it so many times, and it is the only movie that I've ever seen to keep my attention the entire running time.I am a huge movie person, and I will also admit I'm still pretty young, but what I do know is The Godfather tops my list as my all time favorite movie! I've cried several times at the expanse of the Corleone Family! I wish I could truly sum up how emotionally gripping this movie is, but I just can't, I could try all day, but I would keep saying oh I'm missing this, or I'm missing that... I am also reminded of what Marlon Brando said, and I apply this to my life everyday... ""A Man Who Doesn't Spend Time With His Family Can Never Truly Be A Real Man!"""
5375,False,"""The Godfather"" is one of those films that everybody knows about. I heard about it for the first time when I was about three years old, and finally saw it at about age thirteen, after my parents gave in. what I mean to say is that it has achieved such universal fame that it's quoted and discussed everywhere, and rightfully so.""The Godfather"" has it all. The cast is classic and the acting universally stellar, the shooting scenes have just the right level of intensity, the lines are all delivered with precision, the plot is enthralling, and the characters are actually interesting to watch.What is the secret to the success of this great film? That's a tough question, but it's really the fact that everything about the film is done to just the right level. It's never boring, and the plot holds plot twists, but not so many that you grow suspicious of the film.As I've said, the acting is exceptional. Obviously, Marlon Brando gives a legendary performance as the likable Don Vito Corleone. However, also noteworthy is James Caan's fiery performance as Sonny Corleone, and Robert Duvall' star-making work as the cool and collective Tom Hagen. The only shame about this movie is that Al Pacino didn't win an Oscar for it. His portrayal of the reluctant future godfather of the family who is eventually completely corrupted by power is pitch-perfect. The fact that Joel Grey won it instead for his clown-faced role in Cabaret is laughable and painful.The bottom line is this. ""The Godfather"" will always go down in history as the greatest film of all time, and for good reason. It's ""an offer you can't refuse."""
5376,False,"Taking the old-fashioned gangster film to new heights, The Godfather used traditional story-telling freed from the strict censorship that meant bad guys always got their come-uppance. More film noir than thriller, there are no good guys, and we meditate on the small rays of hope within the darkness of corruption, or wonder how far our good and pleasant lifestyles are supported, at some level, by corruption.In dark, Rembrandt-like backrooms, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and his family grant favours, blessings, and generally run things for their friends out in the real, bright and beautiful world. A bride's father traditionally grants any wish, and petitions come from far and wide as Don Corleone's daughter has a colourful wedding celebration outside.It's 1945. Things are changing. Narcotics is the big new industry that beckons temptingly, and one in which the other mafia families have already started. Don Corleone is cautious, but his competitors are envious of the control he has over the police and the judges and want him in. Before long, bloody warfare between the gangs ensues.The Godfather continually contrasts dark and light, external show with violent murky depths, and the devoutness of the gangsters is emphasised. One sequence has a scene of a family baptism intercut with brutal killings ordered by the head of the gang (who is in church). Further similarities to the Roman Catholic Spanish Inquisition might be inferred from a scene immediately afterwards where a confession is obtained from a double-crossing gang member - he is promised redemption but executed anyway.The double nature of the main characters is convincingly emphasised as we watch Don Corleone play with his grandson in the garden, or his successor Michael (Al Pacino) enjoy the idyllic countryside of Sicily. It is taken to a new level when, in a different situation, he tells a blatant lie compellingly and lovingly to his wife so she doesn't think him a murderer. His gentleness goes hand in hand with his brutal nature.The Godfather catapulted the career of the young Francis Coppola and revitalised the career of Marlon Brando. A masterpiece of restrained film-making, its biggest fault may be that there are so many characters and details to absorb in the complex family plots for a first viewing.In a conference over whether to deal in narcotics, one of the arguments that sways the day is that if they don't control them, someone else will step in and do so. By dealing in narcotics at the most powerful level, they can keep them away from children. An argument that should perhaps be given greater consideration by legislators.If anyone has ever made you 'an offer you couldn't refuse', this is the film that created and popularised the phrase. It was meant quite literally."
5377,False,"""GODFATHER is beyond a being called a movie. It is a subject in philosophy which must be studied by men who want to attain great heights."" - HisgraceWhen I first saw GODFATHER, I couldn't stop seeing it for another month. Till date, I still watch it at least once a month so I could relate my affairs for the month with it. Like a mentor speaking, the words of Don Corleone flows through my head. Every move by Michael (AL Pacino) is mathematical. The logic of the whole movie (Part 1,2 & 3) cant be met by any. I tried comparing the movie 'Last Don' to it (Written by same writer, Mario Puzzo) and I just noticed that GODFATHER has no comparing mates. If anyone could come up with a movie like this again then it would have to be the same movie, GODFATHER."
5378,False,i have only recently watched this film for the first time on TV. i didn't know what to expect i have herd great things from some people and not so great things from other people. i had previously never seen a AL Pacino film. then i watched what i believe to be the greatest film ever made and after looking at IMDb's top 250 list i realized a lot of other people loved it to. i loved it from start to finish i was immensely enthralled from beginning to end.this film has superb performances from all the cast. especially from AL Pacino who plays Michael coreleone the son of feared don Marlon Brando who dilverd another great performance. this film got me hooked on crime movies and on AL pacino who is know my favorite actor of all time and also the best. i wouldn't say every body will love this film it is slow to begin with and some people with no taste in film will say it is boring which absolutely incorrect. if you like films at all you have to see the godfather.
5379,False,"I think what made this movie so great was the actors. The directing was also very superb. As i watched this movie, 30 plus years or so after it was made, i totally was engulfed in what was going on in the movie. Most great movies that i see that are older seem to be dull and boring, not this one. Yes it is long, and i had to take frequent breaks, it was far from boring. This is one of those movies that after i saw it i started acting like i was in a mob family. I started saying ""I'm going to make him an offer he cant refuse."" This movie is a great movie that mixes all kinds of genres, from romance to action, but it is mostly a full out drama. This movie is defiantly deserving of the top honor for best movie. I recommend it to all people, and even if you cant appreciate the plot, you have to appreciate the acting. By far the best acting in any film i have ever seen."
5380,False,This movie deserves its place on the top of IMDb's top 250 list. The acting is excellent nobody did bad in this film even the extras. The cinematography was beautiful showing New York in the World War Two era with great authenticity. If you have not seen this excellent movie then you should rent a copy and if you enjoy it buy the box set and watch the entire collection. I believe even the third movie was a masterpiece most people did not like that one because the movie was a little fast paced without any relaxed and beautiful moments like the first two. I believe that everybody should see this movie and even if it doesn't show the Mafia realistically it is still an American Masterpiece and should be watched by everyone.
5381,False,"There is no doubt what so ever that the godfather is a classic film. Hell, some even say its the best film ever made. I on the other hand, think its a great film with some flaws.Being at the tender age of 23, i watched the godfather in its entirety for the first time today. Having seen the complete film, but only in segments, watching it from beginning to end, i found myself enjoying this classic film, but often getting board at the same time.The problem with the film, (if you could call it a problem) is that, its mostly talk. Sure, there's the ocasional gun play, or graphic scene (the horse head is classic) but, compared to scarface, goodfellas, and even the sopranos, it lags by comparison. People want to have a good story and godfather delivers up an offer you cant refuse (im sorry i had to say it), but, its just dull in spots compared to other gangster classics.Overall i found godfather to be a prime example of storytelling and acting, and it deserves every award and honor its receved, but in my book, it fails to over throw the don of gansta films, Scarface (1983)"
5382,False,"I think that Godfather 1 is the best movie ever made. Along side Enemy at the gates, The good The bad and The ugly, Popillon,The Message ¬Ö is one of the outstanding movies, but I can say that godfather 1 is the best. It is my opinion that there are more than 10 sequences in this fabulous movie that we can rate them as the best sequences in history of cinema.I think that story is fantastic; Marlon Brando is incredible, and all the actors and actresses are great. The ending is dramatic and music is also one of the best one. I often see the top sequences for 1 to 60 minutes. I really congratulate to Francis Ford Coppola for this excellent movie. YOU TAPE YOUR NAME IN HISTORY DEAR FRANCIS."
5383,False,"Most critics say it's Citizen Kane. Someone mentions Casablanca. Most people in the world, though, think Francis Ford Coppola's gangster story The Godfather is the finest film ever made. It is a tough one to call, and even if I have to say I prefer Casablanca, Coppola's crime opus is a very close runner-up, its greatness being untarnished after all these years. This epic masterpiece takes place in New York, early '50s. It begins with an ever memorable scene: Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) listens to complaints from one of his associates and, while stroking his cat, accepts to do this man a favor. It's something which reoccurs during the day, since it's part of any Sicilian's code of honor not to refuse any favor on his daughter's wedding day. And whenever asked to do something about any problem, the Don makes ""offers that can't be refused"". It's that kind of attitude which has brought him where he is currently: at the top of the Mafia's power chain. He controls all illegal business in the whole state, and he's ably supported by his lawyer, and adopted son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and two of his biological off-springs, the passionate Santino aka Sonny (James Caan) and the more rational Michael (Al Pacino). The latter is actually a bit reluctant to be involved with the family business, but when other families start attempting on his father's life, he's forced to help his mother and brothers restore order in town.What I've just summed up isn't but a small part of the film (it's almost three hours long, and I've described approximately the first 30 minutes), which is also partially set in Sicily. The Italian segment is the most poetic and romantic in the entire film, as we witness Michael's first dealings with true love. How come he's in Sicily at some point in the film, I can't reveal. But let me assure you, you'll definitely want to visit those places once you've seen the film. The landscape is a visual delight, and Nino Rota's score contributes a lot to making the movie in its entirety an unmissable gem.Since The Godfather deals with organized crime, however, it can't be all pretty countryside and romantic moments. Once you have absolute power, you have to fight in order to preserve it, and that's gonna require quite some violence. Don Vito knows this like no one else, and Michael will learn the lesson when it comes to him to run the family.That's an important theme: family. Behind all its brutality, The Godfather is a remarkable example of how important your own flesh and blood is. It's probably not a coincidence that the film opens with a wedding, when the entire Corleone dynasty is united, and that one of the Top 10 sequences is the one where, during a break from everything underworld-related, Clemenza (Richard Castellano) teaches Michael how to cook pasta sauce, only to be interrupted by Sonny. It's a funny and simple scene, and maybe that's why people still have fond memories of it.Coppola has made a magnificent Italian-American tragedy, perfectly written, directed and most of all acted. Where would much of the movie's greatness be without Brando's immortal, Oscar-winning patriarch? And what about Pacino, Caan and Duvall, all nominated for their fundamental contributions? It's largely thanks to them that The Godfather remains the gangster opus to top them all."
5384,False,"A man immigrants to the United States from Italy and has three sons - the oldest is intellectually deficient, the second is a temperamental bully and hothead, and the third, seems well adjusted and normal. Yet looks can be deceiving, for it is the third son, Michael, who is actually more cunning and more depraved than his two older brothers and proves it. Michael is a merchant of death cloaked in the regalia of middle-class civility which makes him even more lethal. Michael never loses his temper; he dresses impeccably; he's a highly decorated army veteran and has an admiring wife, all of which is mere window dressing masking a viciousness and brutality that is without limit. And what is it that Michael wants? Only to protect his family from ""enemies"" who want to destroy his family. Except the enemies are of Michael's making. Al Pacino's portrayal of the sinister Michael Corleone is one of the great and classic performances in the history of movie making. Mr. Pacino fully and effectively projects every nuance of Michael's distorted and depraved character, from his predatory nature as a merciless and cold blooded killer who shoots two men at point-blank range with whom he is having dinner; to his hypocritical flaunting of religion such as using the baptism of his son as a cover while ordering the assassination of some of his supposed ""enemies""; to his blatant dishonesty such as when he lies right to his wife's face; and to his decision to wantonly murder his own brother-in-law, and thereby make his sister a grieving widow. Marlon Brando got top billing for this movie, but it was Al Pacino who is the real star."
5385,False,"id just like to say that i think that this film is fantastic. i was never interested in in before and thought that it would be rubbish- i was wrong! i had to watch it for my film studies A-level and am so glad that i did, as i would have otherwise missed out on a great film. the film as a whole is amazing, but my favourite part is when Solozzo is murdered by Michael. i believe that this scene is shot fantastically, especially in the way that it creates tension and suspense and the audience is unsure as to whether or not Michael will actually do it. this is the first step that Michael makes to becoming involved in the gangster world. i also love the closing sequence of this film, when Michael has Carlo killed. once again this scene was shot fantastically, especially the way in which the light was positioned on Michaels face. this was that half was dark and the other light. i believe that this was to show how Michael had changed as a character, and that he was now fully apart of the gangster world, being the Don en' all. you can now see that Michael is a cold and heart-less character, and at the very end when the door is shut on his wife Kate this leaves the audience wanting to know what happens next. i haven't watched the godfather part 2 yet, but i know i have too as apparently it is even better than this film, which i find hard to imagine. but i cant wait to see how Micheal's life develops."
5386,False,"The Godfather is known for being one of the best films ever made and i have to agree.The performances in the film are amazing,from the raspy-voiced Marlon Brando to the amazing Al Pacino.And Despite the fact that the film is over three hours long it compels you through the whole thing.The Godfather is about an old Don of the Corleone Mafia Family(Marlon Brando).His youngest son Michael has returned from WWII just in time to see the wedding of Connie Corleone (Michael's sister) to Carlo Rizzi. All of Michael's family is involved with the Mafia, but Michael just wants to live a normal life. Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo is looking for Mafia Families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don's lawyer Tom Hagen, the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart.This film is a work of art that remains to this day one of the the best film ever made.10/10(i wish that i can give it higher)"
5387,False,"Yes yes, this movie is a fundamental classic, an epic piece, a masterstroke from Coppolla, Brando, Pacino, etc. But is it really the best movie ever? Well, that's how I interpret the fact it has been on the top of IMDb since I've looked in here for the first time. What makes it so flawless, what contributes to its eternal shining, blah blah. Maybe it's high time for a change, I'm sure a lot of cult classics have been released since The Godfather has been released. Oh well...I don't like The Godfather. I simply don't feel this movie. Yes it's gloomy, yes it's about mafia's dirty deeds, and oh yes it's about being a part of a family. And of course it's about Kleenex in Marlon's mouth, and Pacino's hands kissed by sad Italians. However I have a feeling that this movie has spawned a countless number of mafia movies, recycling the same themes and Robert De Niro, and furthermore movies like 60 Seconds or Ronin or The Italian Job, which are merely about how cool is it to be a gangster. Which I hate, obviously."
5388,False,"Anybody who denies the entire trilogy as being a cinematic masterpiece is not a fan of cinema. This is by far and will most likely be the best picutre of all time. It is a movie that contains some of the greatest performances in the history of motion pictures. Marlon Brando had a stunning comeback as the result of this movie. Al Pacino also proved that he is truly one of the screens greatest actors and this movie reminds us why we love him so much. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Richard Constellano vividly brought their characters to life in a truly unforgettable film in the first film while Robert De Niro and Lee Strassberg did it in the second film. All in all this is the greatest trilogy of all time"
5389,False,"The Godfather. So much praise has been showered upon it, forming a large mountain of critical excellence. It is almost difficult to quantify how many levels this movie succeeds on. I hesitate to even call this a ""movie"" because it is from the time when a movie was an artform. Sadly, these movies are now a dying breed. The Godfather is THE PINNACLE of excellence on the big screen. You all know that it is a story of the Corleone Family, a large Sicilian Mafia syndicate living in New York and led by Vito Corleone, who is played perfectly by Marlon Brando (I will talk about this a bit later), a powerful Don who demands respect and friendship and offers favors in return. No movie has come close to this one in giving a portrait to organized crime. Not in terms of pure realism or insight, understand. Goodfellas, a great movie in its own right, is a much more realistic story of the way gangsters operate. The Godfather is a glorified Sicilian Mafia tale spun by Mario Puzo and later translated to film by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, showing the near fall from power of the family. The Godfather portrays so many different moral questions and considerations: how can power corrupt a man, how things look from different perspectives, is a man allowed to live outside of society, can a man reject society without punishment and live by his own laws, should someone be true to their family or to society, and much more. The result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.To be fair, a healthy portion of this movie's outward success is due to its acting. Never before and never again has there been such a powerful joint acting performance. It's almost insane to think about how amazing it was, how amazing and influential this entire movie is. Most great movies have one memorable acting performance, two if they are lucky. Four actors- Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall- are best known for their work in the Godfather, the latter three using this title as a springboard to fame. All four acting performances, playing Vito, Michael, and Sonny Corleone plus the Consigliere Tom Hagen, are among the best ever. Along with this, Vito Corleone is probably the most prominent figure in the public's mind when it comes to movies. His raspy voice has become the stuff of legends, and has been imitated by almost everyone at one point or another. Here I will explain why classic movies in general are far superior to today's critical masterpieces. Many people find the Godfather too slow for their tastes. While opinions are different and I do not get mad at people who find other great movies to be superior to the Godfather, people who ridicule this film to be outwardly slow quite frankly do not have long enough attention spans. This is an epic. we are talking slow corruption for maximum effect. Slow unfolding to make it seem more real, not sudden jerks of the plot but carefully constructed twists that are slowly built up and make perfect sense upon further thought. Not to mention that the cinematography is absolutely chilling. Watch the baptism scene and you will know what I mean.This motion picture also features what is considered by many as the single most powerful scene in movie history- I won't spoil anything, but you will know it when you see it. Not to mention the wonderful soundtrack, an instantly memorable score that does a lot to help the film.But by saying that I betray the true beauty of this film. The most prominent reason for this movie's place at the top of the all-time greats is that most movies have a few scenes that stand out when you remember them. Everybody immediately knows what they are afterward. Empire Strikes Back has the final battle with Vader. Rocky has the run up the steps. All of these are obvious. But, while perhaps the scene mentioned above is a bit more prominent, every single scene is done with such consistency and perfection. Coppola is simply a genius, or at least was in the 1970s. There are absolutely no hitches in the screenplay. Every scene is equally intense. But the paradox of this is that not only will you be hanging on to every word and totally absorbed into the story your first time, The Godfather gets better every time you watch it! The first time I saw this, I had not been as exposed to the greatest movies ever. I didn't truly understand all the moral depths of this story, but I still thought it amazing simply for the intensity of the scenes, plot, and the wonderful balance between the characters. However, after watching it dozens of times afterward I now understand all of the tiny stuff in the plot that make it what it truly is. All of the quotes and tiny little things about it are simply fantastic. Once again, in this space I cannot explain all of the greatness. I have not even gotten into the plot. To close, every single thing about this movie just absolutely screams quality. It's hard to find any significant weaknesses with this film, except that unlike the book it does not show the perspective from an outsider's point of view, such as the novel did with Kay Adams. But that is simply a tiny nitpick that we would not mention about any other movie. The effort put into everything else is what makes this visible. Everything else- perfection. If you have not seen The Godfather, DO SO NOW! It will stimulate your mind and emotions like no other movie ever filmed before. This is simply the quintessential film experience. 9.8.""I never listened to the big shots holding all the strings. But I hoped that someday you would be the one holding on the strings."""
5390,False,"The Godfather is not only the greatest movie ever made but can arguably be considered one of the best acting movies also.  Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert DuVall give mesmorizing performances in this classic about the inside of the crime organization known as the Corleone family. But it also tells the tale of Michael Corleone(played by Al Pacino) who, at the beginning, attempts to get away from the family business and move on his own.  But as the movies progresses, Michael becomes more and more attached to the family, and eventually becoming the successor to his father, Vito Corleone.  The Godfather is filled with a great storyline, beautiful acting, and a gruesome showing of the crime family."
5391,False,"What can I say about The Godfather that hasn't already been said?  The film is a masterpiece of cinema, innovative and compelling.  I had the privilege of seeing it on the `big screen' recently at the local theater that shows classics and was as riveted as the first time I saw this film. 
The Godfather has been labeled a `guy's film' and I am generally inclined to disagree based on the fact that I am obsessed with it.  However, upon further reflection, I have to give some credence to this theory since A) My tastes are atypical, B) While most of my friends worship this film as well, they are all guys and C)  It was a virtual testosterone fest at the theater. Regardless, it's a great film and should be viewed at least once in one's lifetime.  If anything, you can slip in some great quotes and horrible impressions at parties.  --Shel"
5392,False,"Well.... I finally got to look at the IMDB voters n¬∞1 movie, the almighty Godfather.Though it's very far from being an average movie, and I admit I was rather immersed in the story, well... I've seen many better movies than this one, whatever angle I choose: story, screenplay, acting, direction, camera, moral points, invention, anything. I don't get its n¬∞1 rating. I suspect many people praise it out of mere conformism.Most of Kubrick's movies are better than this, a couple of Polanski's ones too, just to name a few. Other great classics like ""12 angry men"" or ""Network"" easily surpasses ""The Gofdfather"" both artistically and technically by a fair margin, not to mention more courageous, independant works like ""Brazil"" or ""Citizen Kane"".Excellent movie, for sure, but best movie? Ouch. Its n¬∞1 rating maybe comes from... consensus?Just my 2 cents..."
5393,False,"with no doubt,the greatest movie of all time.loyalty,family relations,business,power,authority or enmity are all in the movie,but while wathcing they are all invisible,when it ends,you can feel them strongly.

5394,False,I think the Godfather is the greatest movie which is ever made. I was a little boy when i saw the film and since then I have think that it is the greatest movie and it¬¥s still the greatest. I love the Godfather! And that is the reason why I want to be a director in the future.
5395,False,"I guess we have all seen the movie, but at the moment I am writing an essay about it, and therefore seeing it over and over, and I must say, it is without a doubt the greatest movie ever made.... However, Godfather part II is close.... See it, and you want to be a gangster"
5396,False,"This movie if so we can call it, because is more than a movie, it's the greatest union of artist, starting with the director finishing with the composer, stepping between the actors. Even if it's not a movie made by a ""true"" Sicilian, it smells like Sicily. Coppola presents to non-Sicilian spectator the gloomy charm of ""my"" arid land. It's not only a mob-movie but also a film where all the elements are united among them: love, hatred, violence, friendship, betrayals, beauty. From the first scene with a great Salvatore Corsitto as Amerigo Bonasera, to the last scene the film keeps even the reclutantest spectator in a vice of emotions. The evocative images of Sicily and don Corleone's speeches (and not only...) have made of this movie maybe the most important work in the cinematographic sphere of all times,an icon. In conclusion of this my short review I can say only one thing: I BELIEVE IN AMERICA"
5397,False,"This is the classic gangster film, it has everything, love, violence, great acting, and a great cast and director.  I think this will continue to be a classic for many years.  It is such a brilliant film and i recommend that everybody that has the opportunity to, to watch it."
5398,False,"As a film critic for one of the national newspapers, I often get asked the question ""what is the greatest film of all time"". For me, the answer comes naturally. ""The Godfather"". When everything is taken into account, from the acting, to the music score, it cannot be bettered. Those who contradict this cannot be as passionate about film as they think they are. Certainly there are other movies in the world, but take it from me, this is the finest piece of film-making you will ever see, it is a true epic. I will reveal nothing more, as I believe a film should be watched afresh, so that it has maximum impact. I would courteousely ask the person who wrote the page long essay on this site to restrict himself in future. Enjoy this film the very first time, enjoy it the second, indeed this is a movie that can be watched over and over, with the viewer discovering a new aspect each time. Enjoy the movie and revel in its greatness."
5399,False,"A young director (Coppola) took by paramount with no big experience and a young protagonist (Al Pacino) with no big experience too, together they realized the greatest movie never made! Taken by the Mario Puzo's book, the Godfather isn't a really mafia story but, overall, is a story of a family, of a man who live for make it stronger and more powerful who finished to ruin it with his same hands... A story of cruel moments and a story of heart's tears too... Now, thirty years later it still be the greatest motion picture never done, with a screenplay with no equals, a cast strong, powerful and good-acting and with a love inside that isn't scary of the present and the future of the cinema.... All the trilogy is great, (overall the second godfather), almost 9 hours of intense emotions! I'm proud to give it 10! And now you can find it in dvd version too, with a special edition very special: godfather (1 disc), godfather II (2 disc) and godfather III (1 disc) with a extraordinary special contents too... where you can find all -and I mean ALL- about this movie we'll never forget for the rest of our life and life that we will live in the future!"
5400,False,"The Godfather is one of the best movies ever, the movie is made for 30 years ago and it¬¥s the best movie i ever seen and will see. If you think "" Casino"", or "" Goodfellas"", is a great gangster movie than you should see The Godfather all parts. I recommend this movie to all over 18 so they can see the beauty on this, i dont really belive the teenager will see that."
5401,False,"The most perfect film ever made.  I watched it with my father when I was young (probably too young).  I have since seen it at least 50 times.  The direction, acting, costume and production is faultless.  There are so many scenes that will be remembered forever.  So many lines that people just know from memory.  The music is also sublime.  Pacino for me steals the show (and what a show).  Maybe only because he has more memorable scenes.  Duvall, Brando and Cazale run him very close.  The three scenes I love more than ever are Michael's revenge in the restaurant (greatest scene of all time!), when Michael realises from the panic in his bodyguard's face as he runs off that Apollonia is in danger and when Sonny beats up Calo and finishes him in the gutter.  Superb from start to finish."
5402,False,"The godfather Must be the best film ever made? The story is so good and the filming by Coppola outstanding There are also so many smal details in this trilogy that are used in other films as a refferens. and the preformans of Robert Duvall (Tom Hagen)is exelent..You can se the same exelent filming in ""Apocalypse now"" in these two films you can see some of the genius that makes Coppola films so great!The Godfather nr:1  Apocalypse now nr:2"
5403,False,"The movie is based on Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather and tells a story of an organized crime family that has moved to America to create a fortune and gather the ultimate respect of the surrounding world.Francis Ford Coppola has directed a masterpiece that lives in its own time and can easily be watched as many times as possible without losing its touch. The movie is quite long and has couple of scenes that are at the same time very violent and very beautiful. Cruel murders are committed and the beautiful music that is played in the background creates an enormous mix of color and sound that has very powerful affect on the viewer who will follow the storyline dazed and amazed. The classic horse head scene, the wedding, murder of NY Police Captain, watching a young war hero to become a ruler of cruel gangster syndicate is just must see scenes"
5404,False,"I'm a movie fan! I love most movies I see (except of, for example, ""Crash""), but, this one movie, for me, has everything a movie must have.First off (and as John Travolta says in ""Swordfish""), it has REALISM. From the girls and the boys at the wedding (all of them seems truly Italian) to the Scene when the filmmaker found he has no legs. Everything it made truly believable. ACTING. And that's not a minor factor. Everyone acts as hell, everything is so well done. Almost impossible to believe. DIRECTING. Yes, this is one of the (if not the) best directed movies. Everything's on its place. I truly love it!I can keep on naming good aspects of this wonderful movie, but truth is that I just can't explain why I watched this movie more than 50 times and still, every single Friday night we gather around the TV set to watch it again...A gem I could not afford not to share with the rest..."
5405,False,"I was surprised looking at my voting history that I had not voted for this one before. Though not my number one it is one of the top ten ever made. The acting is outstanding. Young Pacino was at his very best. I don't want to start naming the actors, because all of them put in their best performance. Few men and women that had appeared in this production had ever made a more impressive performance. If there is any fault with the movie it would be the violence. I don't think that the subject could be relayed with any less and still depict the type of people being presented. The scene with the horse in the producers bed is gruesome, but the subjects are of that caliber. It is one of those movies that has to be seen at least once if for no other reason than because it truly is one of the best films ever made."
5406,False,All my life I heard of this series known as the Godfather series. Do I really want to invest all this time? I heard each movie is three hours long. Do I really want to watch a bunch of shoot'em ups? About five years ago I broke down and watched the first one in the saga. I was completely dumbfounded and amazed with this masterpiece. Very few movies fall under the word masterpiece and this is definitely one of them. I gave this a 10.
5407,False,"The Godfather is one of the best films of all time. Marlon Brando gives a powerful performance as Don Corleone along with Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Cann, and Talia Shire. It shows the brutal strength of the mob and how they controlled things back in the day. It is truly an American classic and is hardly considered a dissappointment to many fans. The winner of 3 Academy Awards including Best Picture of 1972 and Best Actor, The Godfather is indeed a film that any movie fanatic should see because it contains a brilliant script, powerful acting, and wonderful direction. One of my favorite lines from this film is ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" spoken by Don Corleone, signifying the power of the mob and what it can do to get what it wants. Marlon Brando's performance was so superb that he won an Oscar for it. I loved this movie! If you are any movie fanatic, you should see this movie before any other."
5408,False,"The Godfather is the ultimate example of how to adapt a book into a film. Mario Puzo's novel was extremely readable, but didn't seem to lend itself to cinema. It consisted of a whole slew of sub-books, each about a different character, each totally different in feel, each containing pages and pages of backstory and history. Add to this a high quotient of sex and violence, and only the fact that it was selling copiously convinced studio executives to touch it with a ten-foot pole.It's a good thing they did, because I don't know of any other case where so much has come from so little. Everybody is perfectly cast, from Brando down the the most minute walk-on. No punches are pulled with bringing the book's content to the screen, the production design creates a perfect-looking world for it to take place in, the cinematography captures that world beautifully, and the score emotionally underscores it all magnificently.This truly is one of the medium's pillars."
5409,False,"I must admit it wasn't until the second time I saw this film I realised just how flawless it really is.However, what really struck me the second time was just how psychologically deep the movie really is, particularly in respect to the number of symbolic moments used throughout.For instance, note the turning points in the film following Michaels visit to the hospital.  Whilst standing vigil with a nervous (!) friend of his fathers on the hospital steps he lights the other man's cigarette.  He seems to be taken back either by just how relaxed HE is or possibly something more deeper comparing the opening/closing of the lighter to the motion made by the trigger of a gun.Also note a moment shortly after this, following a punch he receives from a corrupt policeman, leaving him with a swollen jaw.  Michael Corleone sits amongst family and friends plotting the murder of two threats to the family business.  He is calm and calculated in his plotting, and even physically resembles his father (swollen jawed).How many other levels does this film go?"
5410,False,"Considered by many people (including the top 250 rank here in IMDb) as the best film in history, ""The Godfather"" is that kind of movie you just can't miss. Where else can we find great actors like Marlo Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan? In part II Robert De Niro enhances this trilogy even more.The story is about Vito Corleone (Brando) who is the leader of a New York Mafia family, The Corleone, that make money with gambling.His son Michael (Pacino) doesn't feel like taking part in this life although he's often invited to by his father.Vito Corleone has even more problems when he doesn't want to take part in drug business and when he sees that there's no one to substitute him in the family leadership.My rate 10/10"
5411,False,"When I first saw The Godfather I sat speechless for about 15 mins. The movie just took my breath away. Watching the whole gang, Brando, Duvall, Pacino, Caan and the others, you just, for a few hours, forget you are watching a movie. You are sucked into their world of intrigues, love-affairs and family-business. If there is some out there who hasn't seen the movie, for some VERY strange reason, I can guarantee you, that you have missed out on the greatest movie of all time. Sure Citizen Kane was great, and so was The Shawshank Redemption, but let's be real... There is NO comparison to The Godfather. Whether you like gangster-movies or not, this is one you can't miss!!!"
5412,False,"This is the one. There is no other. No other gangster film can come close to the power that is the Godfather. The original gangster films like Public Enemy and Little Caesar can't add up to the masterpiece of the Godfather. Equal to the movie Boogie Nights, the Godfather is about family! True, you got the mob relations like Boogie Nights deals with the Porn Industry, but it has nothing to do with it. The main issue of both films is family.The struggle of the family within the family. Watch and see how Michael runs the family different that how his father did. Watch the changing of the world as a new generation takes over. One of Coppola's best. It can never be bettered."
5413,False,"This is more a comment on the comments then on the movie.  The movie was so well made, great story telling, great acting, and a vivid look at a time gone by in American history.  What is really funny is that reading the comments you find two or three people that say this movie was junk.  To say it is not the best of all time is one thing, I like Casablanca and Lawrence of Arabia better myself, but to say that this was a bad movie is unthinkable.  But that is what makes this web site so much fun.  Everyone can voice their opinion."
5414,False,"This is a movie for people who want to watch fat guys eat pasta.""The Godfather"" confuses sentiment with emotion and nostalgia with authenticity. Like ""Goodfellas"", it tries to capture something deep and meaningful about loyalty, family, and honor, but in the end manages only to convey that food plays an important role in Italian culture. Brando's portrayal of Corleone becomes farcical as his brooding look tips over into a vacant stare.In all fairness this is not an altogether bad movie, but it pales in comparison to the novel by Mario Puzo and deserves to be taken down a notch.Watch this for the costumes."
5415,False,"Despite hearing about what a classic this is I hadn't seen this until now. All I can say is Wow!! I didn't know how lucky I was before to miss this but now it is too late and I will never get those 3 hrs of my life back. The acting is cheesy and the story is so simple and shallow, those who thinks there is a deeper meaning must be thinking too hard. I suppose a recent comparable movie would be 2012, but at least that had some ridiculous special effects, all this had was some really bad acting. The best parts were a couple of LOL moments during the shooting scenes, otherwise this has got to be one of the most boring movies ever and I fell asleep at least 5 times."
5416,False,"I noticed that this was the best rated film in this place a couple of months ago, so naturally, I decided to give it at shot. But I just don't get what attracts you folks to it?The character-draving is pretty weak, and you don't really get to go inside the heads of the gangsters. The pictures are pretty ordinary and the whole storyline is... well... boring.I mean no disrespect or anything, but maybe this is to old folks, what the first King Kong film was to my great granfather... Maybe I'm just part of a next generation... Or maybe.. A next step in the evolution. A superman! A mastermind! Maybe I'm going to be king of the hill! Top of the heap! Maybe I need to find some sleep.Sorry. This one did nothing for me, but if you're high on gangsters, this is definitly the one for you.6/10.I'd love to hear from you folks that thinks this is Gods gift to movies."
5417,False,"I don't see what all the fuss is about surrounding this movie.  It is long, slow and boring.  I'm partial to the odd gangster movie (yeah, I know, this isn't a gangster movie it's a 'family' movie...*yawn*) but have seen far better than this (Carlito's Way, Mean Streets, Scarface to name a few).Judging by the comments left on IMDB people say this movie is great due to the acting, the cinematography, the direction etc....what about the plot? The characters?  Isn't that what makes a good movie?  Or are the people who so verbosely extol the virtues of The Godfather all film/media students studying it for their coursework?  Do people say this is a great movie because that's what they hear everyone else say?The Godfather is not a good movie and the emperor is well and truly naked."
5418,False,"Simply put, this is a very poor movie.  The acting was substandard... Marlon Brando stuffs his cheeks, giving himself a speech impediment which is almost unavoidable and does not make for an amazing performance, and Al Pacino walks around with a blank, emotionless face throughout the entire movie (which is the point at some times, but not the whole time).  Diane Keaton also plays easily one of the most annoying roles I have ever seen in a film. Every scene in this film drags on and on and on, making it very possible to summarize the whole thing without leaving out details in around thirty seconds.  The closest explanation I've gotten from anyone I've talked with in person about why this film is so great to them is because ""it's the Godfather.""A movie that puts you to sleep and is not exciting or interesting does not belong as the greatest movie of all time to me."
5419,False,"There is one thing that I've rarely heard anyone point out about the generic list of ""BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME"". You know what they are. No matter what organization or website lists them, the list is almost always the same. And the one thing that the supposed elite movies of all time share in common: As far as story, they're all average. Not a single one of them has even a single scene of outstanding originality, or even flirts with it, for that matter. They're all generic paint-by-the-number dramas filled with pretty moving pictures and filled with people who can pretend to be someone else fairly well. But as far as story goes, these movies are all empty. There are a few exceptions¬óStar Wars, Pulp Fiction, a couple others¬óbut that is a standard rule. The obsession with unoriginality that the pretentious men and women who chose what films are the best has always bothered me. And what better illustrates this than The Godfather? It is nothing but a generic crime drama, yet it's considered one of the greatest movies of all time? Something just seems wrong with that. Something seems wrong with the idea that the men who truly stand up and make original cinema get pushed to hell by critics, while a generic crime movie sits on the throne of God.Perhaps the perfect-scored reviews of The Godfather are right. On a technical level, on a storytelling level, on an acting level, The Godfather is perfection. The directing and production value so far surpasses everything from the early 70s, it's almost unbelievable. The storytelling is done flawlessly. I cannot think of a single 70s film where every single kill has so much value and weight. The acting is the stuff of legends. I will give The Godfather all of this credit, because it earns it. But . . .But none of that dismisses the fact that it is still simply a generic crime drama. No matter how well-done this story is told, it's a story that you've heard long before it was released. Unlike the modern gangster cinema, such as Ichi the Killer or Reservoir Dogs, The Godfather offers nothing new, even for its time. I understand that those examples I just listed are both meant to be taken as over-the-top and unrealistic, but my point still stands. People have created far more original and entertaining crime dramas than The Godfather. There is one subplot that I give this film some creative credit for¬óthe horse¬óbut beside that, this is just copy/paste plotting. If they had used the creativity of this scene more often throughout the movie, this truly would deserve the over-hyped credit it gets. Just because something is realistic does not mean it has to be unoriginal. Personally, I am Italian, and I have heard hundreds of real-life mob stories from my cousins, and they're all infinitely more interesting/creative than anything this film even touched. There is no excuse for The Godfather being as dry as it is.Some will argue that The Godfather is meant to be a drama about family life, not a thriller about crime. If that is true, and it may hold some truth, then The Godfather excels. Somewhat. As far as realistic emotion of family life, it's pretty solid and mildly clich√©-defying. But it's nothing you haven't seen before, and seen with more compelling presentation.The other major flaw that is inevitable to ignore is the pure boredom that sets in every thirty minutes. I've read reviews stating that this modern generation simply can't relate to gangster films, thus it's boring. I've read reviews stating that the plot is generic, thus it's boring. Etc., etc., etc. All these may be valid reasons, but I think the point is this: The Godfather IS boring. It's filled with pointless conversation scenes that add nothing to the overall film or the generic plot or the drama, so what's the point of even including them? Pretentious-minded reviewers say that the viewer needs to be patient . . . Patient for what? Unlike Ridley Scott's Alien, there is rarely any payoff after the endless buildup in The Godfather. There is no entertainment value. While I'm completely fine with a film lacking entertainment value in order to show honest desperation or to intentionally offend, The Godfather does neither. All the reviews stating that this is a violent movie can be ignored. There is far more graphic violence in PG- and PG-13-rated movies of the past two years than this.With all the valid flaws I just listed, anyone calling this movie absolutely flawless is in denial. Or just has extremely low standards. While The Godfather is compelling and has masterful plotting and directing, it is simply just another face in the unoriginal crowd when you look at the big picture.Perhaps it was very influential in cinema¬ówhy should that effect how you personally view the film? Just because pretentious ""film buffs"" claim it's flawless, can you really not think of a single film that you enjoyed more? ""CLASSIC"" is just a word slapped onto films that critics are brainwashed into appreciating. It has no bearing on the true artistic or emotional value. It really shouldn't even have any bearing on public opinion, but it does. Imagine with me a world where The Godfather had been critically hated. Do you really think it would still receive the high public ratings that it has now? I highly doubt it. No one makes up their own mind anymore; anyone who does is considered a mindless shock jock, no matter how valid their reasoning is. While the best reasoning I have read for why The Godfather¬óother than the generic ""good plot, good acting, etc.""¬óis considered so great is, ""BECAUSE IT IS. SHUT UP."" Maybe what they're really trying to say is, ""I have no idea why it's good, I've just been told so, and I forced myself to believe it."" 4/10"
5420,False,"I recently saw the godfather again, 34 times I think. Now, never was a Brando fan, can't stand mob movies, so why should I like this one? Simply, because everyone else does. Its not that the acting's bad (except for brando) its not that its a mob movie, OK, it is that it is a mob movie. I mean seriously, pick a better topic! Not a realistic view of the mob. The mob did things quietly never have I heard in history of a mobsters getting gunned down in his car by many bullets. Oh, and another thing, if this movie is supposed to be realistic, why did the gas can blow up when the shot the car?Only see this movie if you love mob movies and love brando"
5421,False,"The Godfather is an engaging and compelling story to say the least, but as a movie- so what?  Just because something makes for a great story or play doesn't mean it can automatically translate onto the big screen.  There has to be some point of making it into a movie, and quite frankly, The Godfather works just as effectively as a book.  The characters, the dialogue, the plot twists- yeah, they're all okay, but where are the shots, the angles, the editing techniques, the sound effects that make this into a number one film???  The conventions of film are all used pretty simply according to the Hollywood format- ie, make the camera invisible.  There are few scenes anywhere in The Godfather Trilogy that stand out in the history of cinema. If you want an entertaining movie, you will certainly like the Godfather. But you may just as well read the book (unless, like so many today, you haven't the time).  But if you want a film that stretches the genre or that will blow you away with an element OTHER than storyline and dialogue, you can do a lot better."
5422,False,"This is the worst movie ever. It is so over rated. One of the worst movies ever made. 3 Oscars? are you kidding me? more like 0 Oscars. why do people like this movie so much. i guess all critics and 91 percent of people are dumb. oh well, as i was saying, avoid this film at all costs. Al Pacino and Robert Duvall are the worst actors ever.and it's so boring. i fell asleep half way through it. then i woke up. it was still going. i fell asleep again. i woke up again and it was still going! i know i already said this, bt the Godfather is the worst movie ever it was so bad that i'm just kidding. it's a classic. it's still over rated. but that's not saying much. 10/10."
5423,False,"let's give it a good estimationentertainment: it's been said many times that the acting is stupid , including Brando's character just mumbling and Pacino's character just ,well, staring.. truly over-hyped junkie so called acting.the script is bad , it's like a Mexican soap drama. the dialog is below the standard of those Indian cheese. the production value is fair though , shot in Sicily. it seems the producer is not interested in faking locations. overall rating 3/15social/life message: the isn't a particular deep movie. isn't anywhere better than any eurocrime pic. the message is banal: criminals have souls.- rating 0/10politically objectionable things : nothing big really, as I said the director/writer seems to be obsessed with organized crime, he hardly delivers any political or historical material. rating is high 3/5overall rating: two out of ten"
5424,False,"A good job I saw it when it was originally released in the cinema.Because it has never been worth watching since. I usually lose interest after the first party sequence.At the time this was a groundbreaking film, with an excellent performance from Marlon Brando, it's easy to see why they paid him his astronomical fee despite his short time on screen, and it could well have been a momentous flop without him.But this film definitely does not stand the test of time, unlike say 'Goodfellas' 'African Queen' Spartacus etc, very few films do. How it got to number one is beyond comprehension, a very minor classic at best, which has since been done to death by the even more inferior clones, nowadays all very dreary and boring. 'Lawrence of Arabia' now there's a film really worthy of the number 1 spot."
5425,False,"The film is an all round great.It really starts to shine however about half way through, after that it never looks back and neither can you.From that moment on your eyes are fixed on the screen.Its a must see movie so if you haven't had the honour of seeing it yet then i advise you do so.Probably one of the best gangster films ever to be created.Marlon Brando places himself above the bar with his performance as thee Godfather.You basically can't go wrong with Marlone Brando and Al Pacino in the same film on top form throughout.After watching your'll probably never look at a horses head in the same way though, or fall out with anyone who knows you have a horse.A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!!!"
5426,False,"Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece tells the saga of the Corleone family. Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of one of the five mafia families. With his son Sonny (James Caan) and lawyer/adviser Tom (Robert Duvall) he runs the family. But the heads of the other families see the Don as too powerful and out of date with the times. They want to get into drug trafficking and the Don wants none of that. Enter Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) as the Don's other son who has returned from the military. This film is great on every level. The acting, characterizations, dialog and visuals are all perfectly done. For one film to have such a great performance as Brando gives as the Don is one thing. But for the same film to have a second great performance (Pacino's Michael Corleone) is unheard of. Virtually everyone in this film gives an outstanding performance.This film is #3 on the American Film Institute's 100 best films list, right after Citizen Kane and Casablanca."
5427,False,"I haven't seen all dramas, nor have I ever seen all movies made that revolve around the mafia, but this is the best drama I've ever seen, and the best movie that revolves around the mafia, by far. Marlon Brando is a fantastic actor, and while I haven't seen any other films with him, I can't imagine that he's done much better work than he did in this film. Al Pacino was also great in the film, and I think it was fairly early in his career. The film is character and plot driven, which is a welcome change from the action-driven films which is the dominant genre today. The film is never predictable, and is free from the typical cliches that pester most dramas. For a crime drama, it's very entertaining and interesting, for a drama, it's very well-paced, and for a film it's just damn good in pretty much every way. The plot is good, very well-written and interesting; I don't think I've ever payed so much attention to a drama, let alone one that takes almost three hours. It just grabbed my attention from the very first frame, the very first words that were spoken caught my attention, and didn't lose it for a second. It has a good pace, it doesn't rush through the scenes, yet it never gets stale or boring either. The acting is great, all the way around, every single actor does a great job. There weren't any that I felt gave a less than great performance. The characters were well-written, credible and well-developed. There weren't any of the characters that I felt I knew too little of, like it is with most new films, even dramas. The direction and editing is great, some of the cinematography is magnificent. The dialog is well-written and well-delivered. The film has some very quotable and memorable lines. The violence is well-made and not overdone in any way; it shows the ruthless killings that were, in fact, being committed by the mafia at the time period that the film takes place in. The film shows, with brutal honesty and without censoring details or violence, how the mafia worked, and how big their influence was in the 1940's. A truly great piece of cinema, worth your time if you have at least a vague interest in crime dramas or films dealing with the mafia. I recommend it to pretty much everyone, especially fans of any of the actors, the director or crime dramas. Also recommendable to anyone who is interested in mafia films. 10/10"
5428,False,"This is one of the greatest films ever made. Any doubt about that can be dispelled by watching the movie. I missed this when it first came out, and then a curious thing happened. For some reason I thought I had seen the film. One decade and then two went by and I kept hearing what a great film The Godfather was. But I was unimpressed because I thought I had seen it.I don't know what film I had seen, but it wasn't The Godfather. Seeing this film for the first time over thirty years after the fact of its production is a startling experience. The Godfather is a work of art from first scene to last. There is the most amazing adherence to that fiction which is truer than fact.I would like to say that I played cards with Mario Puzo who wrote the novel from which the film was adapted and who famously worked with Coppola on the screenplay, but in fact I only played cards with some people who had played cards with Puzo. Ah, such is the effect of celebrity. Puzo became like Coppola something of a legend after this film was produced, and everybody suddenly knew him or played cards with him. Everybody, from the most unsophisticated celluloid fan to the most erudite and jaded critic had walked out of that theater after 171 minutes mesmerized and delighted and emotionally moved by an uncompromising look at not just a Mafia family, but the psychology of families since time immemorial. The truth that we have all lived and experienced was made large on the screen in the form of the Corleones. I can guarantee you that audiences from every culture on the planet would understand the underlying psychology of this movie and take it to some serious extent as their own.Marlon Brando plays the godfather (the patriarch, of course, or even the warlord if you like) of the past and the present, and then, as must always be the case, comes a new godfather. What is fascinating is who this new godfather is and how he comes to power. The ending of the film is--after so many brilliant scenes and so many psychologically true surprises and so many excursions to Queens and the Bronx and Sicily and Las Vegas (each vignette absolutely integrated into the story of the film)--even more ponderously true and a surprise that sneaks up on us so stealthily that it is not a surprise. And when the credits begin to run after Diana Keaton's tears of realization, we too realize the ""message"" of the film. It is a message that I think would be understood in the Middle East today (and two thousand years ago as well) as I write this, a message of tribal ways and the rise and fall of warlords and the Machiavellian machinations of the prince who would be king.But it is Al Pacino's performance as the son of the godfather that in the final analysis steals the show as he goes from the intellectual boy who would be a legitimate American success at the finest colleges, etc. to a man wearing the hat of Al Capone. And Pacino makes us believe every step of the way.Well, I should not say that it Al Pacino who steals the show. In truth this is Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece. He would not have the film he has without Al Pacino or Marlon Brandon and certainly not without the novel and script from Mario Puzo, of course; but make no mistake about it. Coppola manicured every scene. He attended to every detail, from the color of the wine to the tires on the cars to the dances and the music to the villas abroad to the sleaze of Las Vegas to the perfect casting of the main characters right down to the extras including both cute and not so cute kids, as indeed life would give us. In some very real sense Coppola lived this movie and it was a part of him, and yet I am stuck by the fact that Puzo invented it.This is an American classic, an uncompromising work of art that engages, informs and moves the audience--just about any audience--to ask the great questions regarding who we are and what we should do and how we should live.From the wedding to the funeral to the christening to the priest in Latin voice-over as the final vengeance is planned to that final vengeance (that we know will NOT be the final vengeance), we are glued to our seats as the life of human beings (who could very well be us) passes before our transfixed eyes.Oscars went to Brando as best actor, and to Puzo and Coppola for best screen adaptation. In a rare show of almost universal agreement among movie goers, critics, and the Academy, The Godfather won the Oscar as Best Picture in 1972.Don't miss this as I had for so long, and see it for Coppola who can take his place among the greats of all cinema for this film alone.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)"
5429,False,"Someone please explain why a movie about a gang who use physical nastiness to get a point across has become so beloved? Because they get away with it? Okay, so it was filmed in the dark...what a breakthrough for the industry. Of course, I do tend to go against the majority somewhat.It's good enough, but I save higher praises for at least eighty other movies."
5430,False,"Godfather the best movie of all times, and the only movie worth a 9/10, and Godfather 2 the third best movie?? Come on..., the Godfather series has its moments and especially the first one is not a bad movie at all. But, IMHO, almost all the other major movies about Mafia (especially ""Goodfellas"" & ""Once Upon a Time in America"") are, more interesting and better art too than the bombastic Godfather series. I find even Brando's acting in these movies below his normal standards.And let me tell you why many people like these mafia movies so much: it's just because many people secretly in their heart admire and envy the ""wild & free"" life style of the gangsters. Just the same reason why Bonnie & Clyde etc. are so popular. Or youngsters love to read the Nicky Cruz biography ""Run, baby, run"" because they find the violent & brutal life of the young gangsters exciting and fascinating, blindly ignoring the fact that the author's message is totally against that. Sadly, it is often the same with movies. You think Quentin Tarantino is so popular among the masses because of his artistic merits? You think wrong."
5431,False,"The Godfather is a fantastic movie to watch. The story to it is just fantastic. I don't think you could beat a movie like this, but as well as the other fantastic movies, the godfather is one of the classics i think of all time. This is top of the imdb list as it's the number 1 top 250 movie at the moment, it has been for a long time and i would think it would take some beating to knock this movie off the 250 top movies list. I think that there won't be a better movie that would top the 250 best movies ever, because the godfather is an amazing movie and it is fantastic. I give this movie 10 out of 10."
5432,False,"So i just voted the Godfather 7/10.  But when I had to summarize it in that one line, i just couldn't do it.  It's impossible.  The movie has been so tainted and vandalized in the industry that it seems that it's impossible for one to point a finger on just exactly how they feel.Simply put: the Godfather is a good, solid, 3 star (out of four) movie. Yes, the experienced may have been ruined for me (i first saw it with a cold and didn't like it, so i had to see it later, as i knew something was wrong).  I also may be too young (all the commenters say you have to be over 18.  i say you could see the movie at ten and over).  But i feel the movie is a well written, well acted, well balanced movie.  What's the problem?  Again, I'm speechless.  It lacks a kick, that special kick that so many movies need to have.  Unlike its outstanding sequel, it fails to generate the feeling that the viewer is wrapped in it like a blanket, with the exception of a few scenes.  it best serves as an introduction to a legendary trilogy, rather than just a movie. 
Brando shines as a role that seems written for him, Pacino is great, Caan is head to head with his performance here and with his performance in the gripping Misery (3 1/2 stars out of four).  The script has some of the most realistic writing ever written.  It simply lacks the kick.If a person walked up to me and asked if they should see it, i would probably slap them in the face, ask what's wrong with them, and steal their lunch money.  But I would also tell them that before they see it, they should be ready to form their own opinion.  Now we come to the ""how it was ruined"" part.Hollywood generated and ego for this movie.  if you don't like it, or even have a positive opinion like me, you're automatically not considered a movie buff.  I applaud (and send my heart out to) all the movie buffs on imdb that get up off the ground, brush it off, lick their wounds, and say, ""look punk, i didn't like it.""  It's important to form your own opinion, and i'm sure that there are plenty of people that go around praising this movie when they themselves don't think it was that hot.  I do, though, don't get me wrong, it was a good movie.  If you haven't seen it, i suggest you should, though, only for the sake of seeing a so called classic.  That's it, for those of you looking for the last sentence sum up. Overatted, but still very good.  3 stars out of 4, 7 out of 10"
5433,False,I didn't care for any of the Godfather films.  I think they're some of the most overrated films of all time.  Boring.  I hate mafia movies.  I think Donnie Brasco was better. I think The Conversation is a far superior film from Coppola.
5434,False,"The Godfather is truly an excellent film with a sensational cast, genius writing, and direction. Without leaders like Coppola or Puzo, the book to film could have been a disaster. The story is well-told in length and detail. Characters are built up and explained well. After Godfather, it must be hard for Coppola to make any follow up movie. This movie has stood almost 30 years and it is still one of the most entertaining addictive movies to watch. You just can't leave it yet until its done. People know the Godfather backwards and forwards. I love the scenes shot in Italy with Pacino and the cast. While they use subtitles to relay the Italian language, the movie leaves you breathless. Pacino, DeNiro, Duvall, Caan, Shire, Keaton, were unknown until this movie was released. We all remember Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski. His performance in this film is equally brilliant and incredible. You can't help but watching this film over and over again."
5435,False,"I gave it a 1/10 score because of the huge degree in which this film is overrated. My actual score for this film would be 9/10: excellent but not a masterpiece.It is a very good family melodrama, with very well constructed characters and excellent acting, however, I cannot say I loved this film. It is very good, but nothing really special: It is one of my top 100 favorite films, but not top 50. Why? The main flaw of this film is that it lacks visual art: the truly great films work as pieces of audiovisual art, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey or Coppola's own Apocalypse Now. This film, by contrast, doesn't offer anything besides plot and characters. It is not artistically complete as it doesn't take full advantage of the medium of film.One problem with this type of film, that is, films restricted by plot, is that by being a film about a family and their petty criminal organization severely restricts the scope and greatness of the film. If, instead, the film was done in a post-apocalyptic setting, where Marlon Brando would be the ruthless leader of a small village in the vast wastelands, and Michael his heir, with a Mad Max 2 felling and more action, it would have been a 10/10 film, because it would have been way more epic. (yeah! :) mundane settings suck: :P )But, being a film restricted to a petty criminal organization, restricts its greatness: for me a great film needs a great theme and there is little that is lesser in greatness than a gangster theme. It is simply one of those ""american"" cultural constructs that do not fit in may world view: why one would be so interested in the lives of pathetic criminals?From a technical perspective this film is great, but from an artistic perspective this film is not that great, it is good, but not great. In conclusion: a very good film, but not a great one. Want a powerful drama? Anderson's There Will Be Blood is a way more powerful drama film than this one."
5436,False,"I personally thought that all the Godfather Movies were excellent, It depicts actual events that took place in the time of the Mobster!! I have to say it never pays to have a hot head, and can't think right, as seen in some of these movies, but rather use your brain and then think out your strategies."
5437,False,"I know many people do not care for this movie, however it quickly became one of my favorites. The actors gave these characters special meanings and helped to make the ""criminals"" more ""likable"" in my opinion. This movie is one of my ""go to"" choices when I am looking for something more familiar to watch and I honestly can view it every view days with no problem. If you are looking for a ""mafia"" movie that also spends time showing some of the family connections, than this movie is for you."
5438,False,"It's impossible not to like this movie. It's 'oldie, but goldie'. Such a good movie. And Marlon Brandon is one of the greatest actors ever. FF Coppola made a marvellous job in turning into a great movie the Mario Puzo's book. If you are a movie watcher, you have to see this. It'll mark you for life."
5439,False,First read the novel and then watch it . Both are fantastic . But I prefer the novel . Marlon Brando's best performance ever. Al Pacino was great . Coppola made it nicely . It is the best movie ever made in Hollywood . Probably the best movie on the previous century . It indicates how important can be a family bond . Vito Corleone's quotes - I gonna make him an offer he can't refuse made him more special to me .
5440,False,"The worlds best movie. I simply love the story, the music, the acting, the casting, the filming, the dialog, the flow of the story line, the director, the editing. The audio commentary is also great fun. A 3 hour movie that feels much less. I have re-watched this movie 20 times and I'm far from done with it."
5441,False,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable."
5442,False,"My Personal Rating 10/10 - This film is an timeless classic masterpiece. The Acting the soundtrack the atmosphere the cinematography almost everything on this film is unbelievably perfect, i never saw anything like that in my history of watching movies. the more time you watch this movie the more you will love it, that's what i exactly did. This is my personal favorite movie yet, but it might not be a movie for everyone though."
5443,False,"Copolla directed a film that holds you from the beginning to the end with the merits of the excellent work of Mario Puzo, and an excellent performance of almost everyone in the cast, especially Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. In my opinion is the best of the trilogy and a movie that should be on the list of those who haven't seen."
5444,False,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people (even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a clich√©. His performance though was not a clich√©. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get. The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection. The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable! Overall rating: 10 out of 10."
5445,False,"""The Godfather"" is flawless, and one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. This is the best role Al Pacino ever played, and he didn't win best actor. The only negative thing i could say i have against the film. Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940's, in this well- respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates."
5446,False,"Often advertised to me as the perfect movie, the best movie I'll ever see, and/or the be-all-end-all to movie-dom. It is a damn good movie. There's a reason Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and James Caan are household names. This movie is chock full of stellar performances, beautiful shots, and a compelling family saga. If it is too long (it is), a little slow in places (it is) and somewhat hard to follow in certain places (yep) we can forgive it, because they just don't make movies like this anymore. It isn't perfect, but it is a masterpiece. Do yourself a favor, and let yourself be carried along with the current of this slow-moving, but powerful, bit of culture."
5447,False,"This is one of the best movies about mafia and the best movie about American mafia. It explain all the infrastructure of how things work and it is focus on the characters, what people in that time where and what they feel.Marlon Brando and Al Pacino they play excellent in this. This is the role that launch Al Pacino career.It is remarkable how Francis Ford Copola show the 2 faces of people: one that show to all the family's, the business man, the good guy and the real face of mafia the brutal one, that how they really ware.On top of that it is technically meticulous, marvelously photographed, wonderfully lit, beautifully scored and contains several of the greatest performances and cinematic moments of its era"
5448,False,"Single film, engaging, holds the attention from start to finish. one of the trilogies best I've ever seen, second only to The Matrix and overcoming works like Mad Max. A classic noir film and recommended to all movie lovers on gangsters and the Mafia. The story is unique and the adaptation of the book was great. Quite unique, untouchable. A true masterpiece. Single film, engaging, holds the attention from start to finish. one of the trilogies best I've ever seen, second only to The Matrix and overcoming works like Mad Max.

5449,False,"Chances are you may have heard of this film, then again maybe you haven't. Anyway, let's cut to the chase. 'The Godfather', running at just under three hours, boasts at least four set pieces which will have you at the edge of your seat. The director takes care in familiarising us with not just the Corleone family, but also their staff and associates, which really engages the viewer. We are also witness to the transformation of a certain Michael Corleone. There are elements of tragedy in this film which sows the seeds for future perpetrations of revenge, and the ultimate message that I took away was that man has the capacity to cause absolute carnage, which clearly we already know: I suppose that it does no little harm to remind ourselves of that fact. In terms of the acting, it superlative with everyone putting in credible performances. Given that the director was under incredible pressure to make this a success, it is a fantastic feat and still holds up today as the definitive mob movie. However, let me put all that to one side and reserve special credit to Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola who have created quite possibly the best and most recognisable soundtrack in movie history. If you don't already have it, I recommend that you buy 'The Godfather Trilogy' album: there are songs on the album which, if they don't send a shiver up your spine, will reduce you to tears, such is the poignancy of these compositions. I strongly believe that this film would not have been what it is without this soundtrack - it is that crucial to the overall structure."
5450,False,"opularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family ""business."" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible."
5451,False,"What can i say about The Godfather that hasn't already been said, this film is a masterpiece it is a cinematic landmark, it is in my opinion, better than Goodfellas, Goodfellas is great but this is such a more dramatic film. I love the beginning of this film when the undertaker is asking Vito Corleone for justice, it was such a beautifully shot scene i loved how Marlon Brando portrayed Vito it is one of if not his best performance (Apocalypse Now is his second) of his career. Te Godfather is in my top 10 films of all time and it will always will be no other film can change that. The Godfather will always be remembered as the greatest film of all time and will never be forgotten, i just love this film so much it actually was one of the inspirations that made me want to become a film director and I'm only 14, it made me actually made me appreciate film and i am glad i watched this even its sequel was amazing and is in my top 20 favorite films of all time but 3 was terrible it should have never had ever been made and i will stick by that as long as i live but i love Francis Ford Coppolas direction of the film it will never be forgotten."
5452,False,"Francis Ford Coppola has outdone himself with The Godfather, probably the greatest movie in cinema history. Marlon Brando shows us his magnificent skills and his way of dominating the scene. The Don's relationship with his family is unique and incredibly well depicted. Looking at Brando's career, which is frighteningly impressive, to say the least, the role of Don Vito Corleone is without a doubt his best one. To say that Al Pacino was incredible in this movie and the rest of the trilogy would be an understatement. James Caan, in the role of Sonny, comes right after Brando and Pacino's stunning performances. Truly a masterpiece, The first part of this epic trilogy will forever be at the very top of my list."
5453,False,"The Godfather is a textbook on cinematic lucidity - an exquisite, cohesive Mafia epic that is rightly hailed as an all-time high watermark of American cinema. Based on the novel by Mario Puzo, The Godfather constructs a sprawling family saga that tells the story of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the spider at the center of a web of deceit, murder and larceny. When the Don is left incapacitated by an attempted assassination from a rival crime family, the family quickly seeks to fill the power vacuum left by his absence and it is left up to his sons - the hot tempered Sonny (James Caan), meek mild Fredo (John Cazale), adopted Irish son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and the fiercely independent Michael (Al Pacino) - to run the Corleone clan. Hardened by the reprisals taken against his family, the 'white-sheep' son Michael Corleone is drawn irresistibly into the gang warfare, which hints at the beginning of his moral descent. Thus underlines the tragedy of The Godfather, with the sins of the father bestowed upon his children, who if not met by death's hand will be plunged into hellfire for their actions. But, underneath all the slayings and sinister ""offers you can't refuse"" this is an immigrant family drama about assimilation, blood loyalty and honor.The Godfather has a richly operatic feel to it, thanks to the solemn and stately classicism that Francis Ford Coppola brings to his pulpy material. He doesn't waste a single frame of celluloid in telling the story of the Corleone family. Every scene illuminates the motivations behind each character and dilemma within the family and all the people that surround it. The artistry of Coppola combined with Gordon Willis' spot-on cinematography and Nino Rota's haunting score covers many scenes in a deep veil of shadow, ensconcing the audience in an atmosphere of unconditional involvement.Each performance is a vignette that fits exquisitely into the whole picture. The character of Vito exhibits the brilliance and innovation of Brando's thespian prowess, creating a staggering mafia figure within a world of stereotype. Brando's restrained motions and rasping speech patterns are stunningly suggestive of power while his actions (courtesy of the script) wield it. His resident power, his sheer innate force, has rarely seemed weaker. As Vito's hesitant son, Pacino rises to the occasion admirably. He beautifully underplays Michael's evolution from returning war hero to the new head of the Corleone family. Caan, gives a splendid portrayal as the hot-headed Sonny while Robert Duvall is steadily efficient as Tom Hagen. Diane Keaton is just right as Michael's oblivious love Kay.The Godfather will continue to hold a central place in cinema history, an epic which has colored everything made subsequently with its imagery and operatic scope. An enduring masterpiece!"
5454,False,"Instead of focusing on everything that is extraordinary about The Adoptive parent, a much simpler path for me to judge its quality is on what is awful about it. Each film has something that I don't care for about it, however I can genuinely say that I wouldn't change anything about The Back up parent. There is nothing powerless about it and nothing that emerges as terrible. That is the reason it gets ten out of ten. This is one of those movies that made me ask why I hadn't seen it prior. The acting from everybody included is extraordinary, Marlon Brando runs over superbly as the leader of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are astounding as his children. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is additionally extremely essential, bringing back memories of the film each time I hear it. The plot must be fabulous for it to get ten out of ten, and it will be, its a long way from unsurprising and the film is the meaning of an awesome epic. The film is really stunning in the way every demise happens momentarily, and as it compasses ten years such a variety of distinctive things happen and each moment of it is extraordinary stimulation. It's a well- made and enthralling film that is just the first piece of a set of three, yet it remains all alone as a superb film in its own particular right. On the off chance that you haven't seen it, what are you holding up for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't baffle."
5455,False,"I wasn't too impressed by this film the first time I saw it. However, it got better the more I saw it. A movie like this would be impossible to make today. Francis Ford Coppola is a marvelous director and loves his characters in order to get authentic performances out of them.The violence is brutal, the script is superb, and the soundtrack is incredible. Everyone involved should be proud at what they accomplished. I never read the book but fans say it's a faithful adaptation. Goodfellas is a mobster film I like slightly more but The Godfather is still a cinematic achievement. I know some people are going to get on my case for not calling it the best movie ever made in the history of mankind, but I'm not denying that it's a good movie.Just watch it more than once to enjoy it for what it is and you'll love it like I did!"
5456,False,"..Barzini's a pimp. That is my favorite line in this movie...There are many more lines. Lines that everyone should watch. Because this movie is one of the best movies ever made, and certainly one of the best mob/crime movies. If you like Goodfellas, Casino, or anything else with Joe Pesci. You will like this movie just as much. The cinematic quality is fantastic. The dialogue and acting are very convincing and makes it feel like you are watching history, not just a movie. And speaking of history, talk about Marlon Brando. Good lord. The guy puts his existence on pause to breathe life into Don Vito Corleone as the Godfather. His roll is phenomenal. And that's 10 lines, go watch the movie"
5457,False,"The Godfather is in my opinion the second greatest movie of all time. The pacing is flawless, the acting is absolutely mesmerising and the story is the most ""simply complicated"" one ever. Brando and Pacino were a match made in heaven for their characters and no movie will ever reach the pinnacle like The Godfather did. Stunning brilliant.10/10 Acting10/10 Story10/10 Pacing10/10 Adaptation from novel10/10 Overall"
5458,False,"I like it. This is good film and 10/10. Thanks all! I watched all series of this film. The Godfather is the finest cinematic achievement ever. It had the first truly ensemble cast, and writing which matched, if not bettered, its masterful source material. It was a truly original mafia film of its time, imitated by a lot more media as time passed. It was the first gangster film to revolve around the families of the gangsters, rather than the action, which just added to the suspense. The Godfather's essential components from its cinematography, editing, score, directing and writing can be praised to the ends of this Earth, but one thing always stands out for me: the acting. Marlon Brano's Vito Corleone is rightfully seen as the legend's greatest performance; Robert Duvall and James Caan are the two only imaginable actors (who gave instinctive performances) for the roles of Sonny Corleone and Tom Hagen. But Al Pacino, in a brilliantly developed role as Michael Corleone, stands out due to his convincing acting, along with an interesting and cohesive back story. Every other actor is appropriate for their roles, and all are phenomenal in their career best performances. It is by far, the greatest film I have ever seen and my favorite film ever."
5459,False,"Plot Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is brutally pursued when he refuses to Sully the family business with drugs. His eldest, Sonny (Caan), steps in to take the helm in his father's illness, but is riddled with bullets. It is up to Michael (Pacino), the war hero and beloved son, to step up redeem the family's honourThe Godfather packs more into one gangster film than some genres output over decades. It is a big film with big themes, has memorable characters and lines. Mario Puzo novel once again proves that he's the master of storytelling ¬ó and Francis Ford Coppola of thrillingly violent filmmaking. With its all star cast this should go straight to the head of the list of essential viewing. With a classic sequel also to view. You will rarely get it so good.Makes Bernard Mungeam 5 star films"
5460,False,"Godfather is a groundbreaking and truly original piece of legendary film. With a cast of Oscar winners and awesome script, this film feels like you have been implanted into the scene of a real environment. Life like acting with emotive vibrations, grips you from the offset, with a compelling story that seems to get more intense and exciting as the film rolls on. This film will never get old and I have the lost the count how many times I have watched the famous trilogy. Having owned this on Video, DVD and now Bluray, I can honestly say this will be in my collection for all time. True classic. Peace and Blessings"
5461,False,"Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar."
5462,False,"A cinematic masterpiece from director Francis Ford Coppola. One of the greatest movies ever made. Marlon Brando made Don Vito something we rarely see in movies: realistic anti-hero, villain with million of verges. It's also story about how one good man (war hero) become a genius of a criminal world. Every scene was directed with the soul. Combined with Part II. In this movie perfect everything: perfect characters, adapted screenplay, and original soundtrack. Film about relationship between family members, loyalty, honor in life of gangsters and revenge. The Godfather did for gangster movies what Alfred Hitchcock did for Thriller (Suspense) genre."
5463,False,"The godfather is one of the greatest movies ever put together. Francis Coppola directed it in 1972 and integrated brilliant costumes, dynamic plot, detailed set, emotional sound track, and amazing actors involved in every scene the movie was one of the greatest successes of it's time and continues to remain a classic. I was born in 1990 and even though much as changed from when this movie was created to now, it is still a movie I can watch, enjoy, and appreciate because all those things listed above were spot on. This movie falls into multiple genres. Of those the largest is Crime Fiction. This genre crime fiction is the literary genre that fictionalizes crimes, their detection, criminals and their motives.The costumes not only fit the time in which the movie was set for, but as each set ventured from one location to another they matched the costumes with the location and each scene appropriately. Additionally each character seemed to have their own sort of style they displayed through these costumes. If each character looked and sounded the same, a viewer could easily guess the character by the clothing they wore. The plot engages the movie beautifully. From the beginning to end it leaves the viewer having a very direct and excellent understanding of what is happening and how it ties in to the main story. Even through watching the movie multiple times and knowing what happens I can still avoid anticipating what will happen next because it is so well established and drawn out. Matching costumes, characters are captured in beautiful and well constructed sets. Viewers can actually watch the movie and though have never been to where the movie takes place, they are able to visualize and understand exactly where they are. This movie does an excellent job at not just focusing on where the action is but showing a larger portion of the picture to allow viewers to fill in any additional puzzle pieces that normally aren't formed but in some cases with some viewers is absolutely necessary to understand exactly where they are in each scene. The sound track is very emotional. The symphony sound texture to the music allows background music to be applied to a scene and assist viewers to visualize what is going on and the emotions to be expected while the scene unfolds without requiring the use of additional vocals. This is exceptionally beneficial at the beginning and ending of each scene, as it displays the mood of the scene as it starts out or leaves a lasting effect of whatever just took place. Last but not least the actors are the people who made the film what it was. Each role was very specific to the actor and very distinguished from one to another. In specific, the Don's sons Michael and Sonny, were extreme opposites. While one was very calm and easy going the other was very hot headed and gung hoe, looking for action and death to those who disagreed with him or stood up to the other family members. All in all the movie was wonderful from beginning to end ultimately I would not change a single thing or think something could have been done to better the film. I definitely recommend anyone who has not watched this movie already to check it out!"
5464,False,"The movie is more than worth watching, it is one of the classic movies of the American cinematography. Al Pacino is as always great. And the story, the atmosphere and the spirit of Italian-American neighborhoods, of ""old school"" mafia, ""La Cosa Nostra"", was transferred amazingly great. You shall see lots of interesting stuff about Italian Mafia traditions, about their Code, that used to value back in the days. In my humble opinion, the second part (The Godfather II) is not as good as this one, and you should definitely see at least this. I remember I first heard of this movie from my grandfather. And if he advised the movie, it meant that it's good indeed. This one was not an exception."
5465,False,"Phenomenal! One of the best movies ever made. Great acting! music, screenplay! Great directing. I can't express my feelings with just words. One of Hollywood's greatest films. It may take a many viewings to fully comprehend the film. I wasn't ready for what this movie had in store for me. This movie will pull you in each time you watch it. There is nothing wrong with this movie. The story is great, the characters are very carefully chosen. Al Pacino's performance is very good.. This is one of Francis Ford Coppola's best films ever. A piece of art which will live in the hearts of many, This film is a brilliant mob movie, that everyone should watch. Everyone I know loves this film. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando give give great performances in their finest movie ever. The amount of work put in The Godfather is just amazing! I can feel each character's emotion in this movie. I give it 10 out of 10"
5466,False,"The Godfather is the best film about the Mafia that has been done so today. He not only accurately portrays the disputes against rival families. The film also shows the whole family psychology that involves the family and relatives and friends who live with the family of Don Corleone. The wedding scene is one of the best scenes in the film, kept showing the Italian traditions, even though the USA The scenes of struggle and war between rival mobsters is also taking the breath. This movie is one of the few sequels that had the same quality of the first movie without losing quality. Not enough watch the first film we got to see three movies in a row ... hugs"
5467,False,"What can I write about this movie that you don't already know,released in 72 and still to this day the greatest Mafia movie made, strong cast and strong Scripts and when you have that combination you have a hit on your hands that can never be bettered, at the end the quote of the movie,Connie to Michael""did you kill him ,"" did you kill him Michael? he shouts back "" never ask me about my business"" then the pause and then the Answer "" NO "" she walks out and the door slowly closes and the audience cannot wait for more until we got GodFather 2, THAT IS FOR ANOTHER DAY,Al Pacino comes into his own in this movie and as for Marlon Brando excellent performance,I only wished they kept him alive a little for GodFATHER 2,"
5468,False,"Few movies that get my attention and makes me day dream about, and Godfather i,ii, and iii sure does that to me. I would lay in bed, office, or school and think about some memory moments during the movie, i.e., ""oof maroon only if I can have the bag of money"" as it is truly one of the many best moments in Godfather during the wedding, the driver for the Godfather wished he can rob the bag of money gifts which had all cash in it. Honestly, all mob movies make me and gets me so excited as it always has and always will. There is this special connection I really can't figure out what it really is, but for what its worth its there. If you watch mob movies and those that are classic you can relate to what am saying. All and all Godfather will always stay in a special place in my heart and my kids future. As I will make sure my son watches it as soon he turns 18. Because it has real, true, manly life lessons we can all learn a few things from. As movies inspire us but doesn't define us. love the movie."
5469,False,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable. The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather."
5470,False,"This movie is a classic. When you think of all time best movies Godfather definitely comes to mind. The director, writers, actors & everyone else who had a part in making this movie are genius's. I think Godfather will be a classic 100 years from now. I just called 4 people & asked my husband the same question. ..""What are the top 3 best mob or gangster movies of all time? "" They ALL said Godfather & Scarface. 2 said Good fellows too. So it's not just my opinion. A lot of people know that this movie was one of the best movies ever! I may not be a movie critic or an actor, my daughter is an actor though & I know that ever since she has been acting, I actually pay attention to if someone really is a good actor or not & Godfather is full of awesome actors. After sitting in on many acting classes with my daughter I can tell a great actor! Thank you for making such a classic movie that will never get old. No matter how many times you watch it, it never gets old."
5471,False,"The Godfather is often considered to be one of the greatest films of all time and for good reason. It's a timeless classic that doesn't feel like it dated a day, only getting better with each passing watch. It is Coopla's magnum opus, showing the potential that cinema has as a storytelling art form. It revolutionised narrative as rather than telling the story of one character, Coopla built up a life style by showing these criminals in both their everyday life and when under threat. The story spans 5 years, showing us every detail of how the mafia operates. We see everything from their joy at a wedding to their shaded business meetings where death is talked about callously without guilt.When violence is used Coppola never holds back. He will show every gruesome detail with faces gasping for oxygen, the blood trickling down their skin and the intense screams of pain of the victims. It is this realism and details that make many of the most memorable scenes as it was one of the first times that a film used such realistic violence. The film probably has one of the greatest casts assembled to a film with so many memorable characters. Even with a 3 hour runtime, many of these characters don't even play that large a role in the story or even get too much screen time. But the actors get their roles down so incredibly that they build their own character through the way they speak or the hesitance of talking against a powerful figure like the godfather. Throughout the film doesn't have a single weak performance. But of course the stand out of the cast was Brando. I remains one of cinemas most memorable performances, with his introducing shot alone being one of the most recognisable images in cinema with his calm reaction to being asked to kill a man. He becomes the image of power inciting fear into even his own assassins who stutter when talking to him. Certainly Brando is the film's most iconic role, though sometimes overlooked is Pacino with one of the most memorable transformations in film going from a respected war veteran to violent crime lord. Far more emotional than his father he is hesitant about violence at first, but quickly becomes accustomed to the violence of his life of crime. By the end of the film he doesn't second think killing his own step brother as an act of vengeance. Pacino was perfect at emphasising this change with both the tone of his voice and rage in his eyes creating the real image of a man who has changed over the years. But it's not quality alone that has made this film so memorable. What makes The Godfather such an icon of cinema because it represents what all films should try to accomplish, by taking risks that no other film would make. Coppola was never afraid to show the detailed violence or take risks by experimenting with narrative, because he wanted to make his own unique vision on screen. It's for this reason that it has become timeless, representing a masterclass in filmmaking and reminding us all of the innovation that makes us love cinema."
5472,False,"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, in my opinion one of the best American film ever made and The greatest gangster film ever made. The Godfather is worldwide avowed as one of the greatest films in world cinema.The film is about the importance of Mafia family life, the relationship between a father and his sons, power, loyalty, envy, corruption and succession all underscored by composer Nino Rota's iconic music.The Film makes Deep impression onlooker, you're Watching a movie and you are indebted to the mafia life. Great Movie, Great Cast, Great Director, Great Coposer...!!!"
5473,False,"I'd never seen the Godfather prior to this weekend. A friend of mine asked how I can consider myself a movie reviewer, when I haven't even seen the film that is widely considered to be the best of all-time. He had a point, so I decided to rent it and my verdict is it. While the Godfather is a tremendous epic drama, I really don't see how it is considered to be the best film ever made. It's a great story, with a superstar cast, which set the genre for all the mafia films that followed, but that in and of itself means the film is going to have problems. As with other mafia films, it's difficult to keep track of who's who in the large cast. It also moves rather quickly and viewers like myself are going to have a very difficult time of trying to follow the erratic timeline of the film. Some parts move at a snails pace, while other just fly by, and what is with the music? The soundtrack is almost as acclaimed as the film, but honestly if I had to hear that song one more time, during this three hour epic, I may have gone out and killed someone myself. For those unfamiliar with the story, it follows the evolution of the Corleone family, as they transition from one leader to the next. The story is fantastic and is the furthest thing from predictable that you will ever find. It is filed with classic scenes and renowned performance from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, but I really have a hard time calling such a complicated story with that much violence, the best of all-time. The Godfather is a terrific movie, and I'm glad that I finally got to see it, but in a word, the film is overrated."
5474,False,"Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael , Santino and Tom Hagen , his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates. he Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy."
5475,False,"This movie has the right to be #1 in the top 250 from IMDb. Meta's have given it a 100/100 rating and the users have given it a solid 9,2. This film has been made with exceptional eye for detail and great artistic performances. You have to listen very well and keep concentrated every second of this film, because everything seen and heard appears to be a vital bit of information. It is the best movie ever made, with some of the best actors to have ever lived. Marlon Brando is a triple-A class actor and he shows it in this masterpiece. This is one of Al Pacino's first movies and he definitely left his mark, his performance has opened many doors for him, but most of all, it made the best movie ever!"
5476,False,"From the first until the Last only the Best of All the PastThis is the Movie You cant forget it you never forget its name or those scene this is the shortest 3 hour movie its very short & very hard and soft. Only the best of bestbest actors best director best writer only best of best. Plays of Marlon Brando is Awesome His is the sensitive hard man even word make you confuse.Al Pacino, A hard strong man stone heart man that you could see the good in it And Fredo a big dumb brother !!! like hell in hell!!! Gather of these With Work of the Francis Ford Coppola & Mario Puzo Make the best of best."
5477,False,"An American classic, and one of the greatest film's ever made. Director Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece, based on Mario Puzo's bestselling novel starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton. The film chronicles a ten year span (1945 to 1955) in the life of the Italian-American Corleone crime family of New York City.It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great. The Godfather lives up to the term masterpiece. The greatest gangster film ever made. Coppola offers a rich and layered look at family and does so with an incredible cast and a meticulous amount of detail""must see"" masterpiece."
5478,False,"The Godfather is the finest cinematic achievement ever. It had the first truly ensemble cast, and writing which matched, if not bettered, its masterful source material. It was a truly original mafia film of its time, imitated by a lot more media as time passed. It was the first gangster film to revolve around the families of the gangsters, rather than the action, which just added to the suspense. The Godfather's essential components from its cinematography, editing, score, directing and writing can be praised to the ends of this Earth, but one thing always stands out for me: the acting. Marlon Brano's Vito Corleone is rightfully seen as the legend's greatest performance; Robert Duvall and James Caan are the two only imaginable actors (who gave instinctive performances) for the roles of Sonny Corleone and Tom Hagen. But Al Pacino, in a brilliantly developed role as Michael Corleone, stands out due to his convincing acting, along with an interesting and cohesive back story. Every other actor is appropriate for their roles, and all are phenomenal in their career best performances. It is by far, the greatest film I have ever seen and my favorite film ever."
5479,False,"The Godfather (1972) was directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who in 1970 directed the successful movie Patton. Although the Patton movie was successful, not even Coppola could have predicted the success that was produced by The Godfather. The movie was based on a novel by Mario Puzo, who along with Coppola wrote the screenplay. The lead role was played by Marlon Brando, and he was supported by great actors, such as Al Pacino, James Cann, Robert Duvall, and many others who put in amazon performances.The first scene sets the stage for the rest of the movie, and gives the viewer an early insight as to what to expect through the movie. It starts off in a dark room where the face of an old friend of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the old friend was begging Don Vito to help him deliver justice to the two men who had beaten his daughter. Don Vito Corleone was offended that his old friend had gone to the police for help before coming to him. However, when his friend explains he was scared to because he desired to live an honest life in America, but when a judge gives the two men suspended sentences, he knows the only way to punish these men was to go to Don Vito Corleone. It is apparent from the beginning that Don Vito Corleone is a dangerous man, but he is also shown as a compassionate man, when he agrees to help his old friend, but tells him he may one day ask for a favor in return for his help. The favor he asks from his old friend is one that will shock the audience!That same day, the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter was going on, and after the meeting with his friend, he went out for a family picture. Another soft side of the godfather is revealed as he puts off the family picture until his son Michael (Al Pacino) arrives. Michael shows up dressed in a military uniform and is the only member of the family not involved in the family crime business. An exciting sequence of events changes that, however.This movie from start to finish is full of excitement and surprises, and it starts when Don Vito Corleone once again shows he has morals and refuses to involve his family in the drug trade. Not all the New York families process these morals, and the bloody feud ensues, which leaves the viewer on the edge of his or her seat anticipating what is going to happen next. This movie is not for the faint hearted, but it shows both sides of a crime family, from the love they share for their children, wife's, and other family members, to the murderous rages, which can be triggered at any moment. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino put in stunning performances' which is supported from the excellent supporting actors.' With 32 awards, which include three Academy Awards, and 19 nominations for awards, it would not be an exaggeration to say The God Father is one of the best movies of all time. For anyone who has not yet watched this movie, it will provide 175 minutes of ultimate excitement, and leave him or her eager to watch The Godfather II."
5480,False,"Well, there is pretty little to say about the bad side of the film, but about the good ones a lot can be said. The story was amazing, ahead from most of its time. The pacing was also incredible, one that wouldn't put you through boredom. I think as a film student, the film should be used as a study case for those who would like to write stories that could be translated into films. The actors were good as well especially the main character; one would have to watch to understand. How the dialog is held and how it translates to the character of the individuals in the film. The cinematography was fantastic; well I look up to be one so in short there use of color, shots, light is what makes the story even more interesting. I love the depth of their blacks and how they use the warm tones to convey some emotions and moods in the film. In short the film should be used widely in film schools for multiple purposes in the film industry."
5481,False,"The Godfather is rightly regarded as one of the finest movies ever made, and this review won't seek to be a mere repetition of its finest qualities. Technically, thematically and theatrically, the film is an undeniable masterpiece. It took what is an enjoyable, but pulpy, populist crime novel into a deft piece of art. One can only attempt to highlight some interesting observations here.Watching this again recently with friends who have never seen it before is an interesting experiment. After seeing the film numerous times one forgets that the story and the characters, while never particularly convoluted, are nevertheless numerous, steeped in a subtly defined hierarchy that for the uninitiated is overwhelming, to say the least. Especially overseas (Britain in this case), the younger generation have to fill in gaps that would have been closer to common knowledge upon release in the US. Notwithstanding its wide berth of characters and relationships, the film's central arc, that of Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) descent to Don, is never clouded; Part II, while arguably as good if not better than Part I, suffers initially from juggling multiple arcs that while well-crafted and excellent, are not nearly as accessible.While all remember the set pieces, particularly the wedding and baptism that masterfully bookend the film, on multiple viewings it's the quieter, thematic scenes that really shine. A personal favourite scene is the last scene shared between Michael and Vito (Marlon Brando) discussing Vito's desires for Michael, which merges duty, family and aspiration in a truly touching scene. One can make a serious argument that The Godfather Saga is really an embodiment of the American dream (note the Statue of Liberty in the 'cannoli' scene background), and Vito's entire outlook captures this. The scene is certainly the thematic backbone of the movie.What has been occasionally discussed in detail elsewhere, but deserves a mention, is the portrayal of Kay. It's a nuanced performance by Diane Keaton, and the costume design is a fantastic touch. In her scenes where she is most distant, Kay's colours are bright reds and oranges, in sharp contrast to the surrounding characters (the wedding; when she looks for Michael at the compound). As she falls in with the family, her colours become muted. In terms of gender portrayal (something the film almost-understandably struggles with; it never comes close to passing the Bechdel test), Kay certainly fares better as a character than Apollonia, who is little more than an object of desire. Her willingness to be there for Michael is almost questionable however. Yet, ultimately this is a quintessential story about men, in a world where women had not yet encroached as individuals separate from men (it's no accident that the women get a greater role in Part III). One can suggest that the fact that all the women are defined by their male connections is less the fault of the material than it is the reality of the profession and period.The Godfather, possibly by virtue of being a period piece, has barely aged in 40 years. Sure, the issues it discusses and the world it portrays are transformed, but like a painting it captures beautifully a freeze frame, a snapshot period of aspiration and ambition. It will continue to be adored for years to come."
5482,False,"the godfather does what it does at it's finest, memorable moments,characters and situations. all the actors made the best they could and more, interesting plot and mix it with some drama-crime you have a master piece, glorious and epic in mafia movies and one of the best if not the best movie ever made, Francis ford made the best crime drama movie till date and alpacino made the godfather even better with his acting and role, the moment that stick's out is ¬®""ill make him an offer he can't refuse"" it is just a small line but epic if you understand it and know what could happen because he is the godfather and he is the mafia leader and he does a fine job at doing so. 10/10 godfather approves"
5483,False,"This is a classic film and the actors are truly amazing. An epic tale of a 1940s New York Mafia family and their struggle to protect their empire from rival families as the leadership switches from the father to his youngest son. one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family ""business."" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl, Michael marries her, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered, having been betrayed by Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare. Thanks to RT and other reviewers."
5484,False,"I am honestly shocked how much I adored this film. I knew I was going into a darn good flick, but not THIS good. It is everything I thought it would be and more. I legitimately finished watching this film for the first time today, just an hour ago and I know this has surpassed every other film I've seen. I'm watching Part II right now, but I find it as a 9/10 so far, completely enthralled by Vito's story, but I currently find Michael's tale a little lacking. I will release a review later for that, but it might get up to 10/10, after all, I still have two hours to go. Never the less, I found Godfather Part I to be spectacular with Brando's slightly overacted but still marvelous performance as one of it's strongest parts, along with an astonishing score, fantastic editing, and great cinematography. A true must-see."
5485,False,"The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema[4]¬óand as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre.[5] Now ranked as the second greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute,[6] it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990. The Godfather was a blockbuster, breaking many box office records to become the highest grossing film of 1972. It earned $81.5 million in theatrical rentals in North America during its initial release,[30] increasing its earnings to $85.7 million through a reissue in 1973,[31] and including a limited re-release in 1997 it ultimately earned an equivalent exhibition gross of $135 million.[2] It displaced Gone with the Wind to claim the record as the top rentals earner, a position it would retain until the release of Jaws in 1975.[32][33] News articles at the time proclaimed it was the first film to gross $100 million in North America,[32] but such accounts are erroneous since this record in fact belongs to The Sound of Music, released in 1965.[34] The film repeated its native success overseas, earning in total an unprecedented $142 million in worldwide theatrical rentals, to become the highest net earner.[35] Profits were so high for The Godfather that earnings for Gulf & Western Industries, Inc., which owned Paramount Pictures, jumped from seventy-seven cents per share to three dollars and thirty cents a share for the year, according to a Los Angeles Times article, dated December 13, 1972.[32] To date, it has grossed between $245 million and $286 million in worldwide box office receipts,[36] and adjusted for ticket price inflation in North America, ranks among the top 25 highest- grossing films"
5486,False,"When I first went into this movie, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. Sure, it often was on the top of lists of the Greatest Films Ever Made, but that was likely to create nearly-impossible hype. (Which had previously caused disappointment upon my first viewing of ""Citizen Kane"") I had previously found the movie in an article called ""Movies You Hate the First Time but Love the Second."" And it was also three hours long, so it would definitely have its slow scenes. (I was only able to make through the first 90 minutes of ""Lawrence of Arabia"") Cautiously, I turned the movie on. And within minutes, all my doubts disappeared.For those of you who haven't seen it, ""The Godfather"" is the story of Michael Corleone, the son of Vito Corleone, a powerful Mafia boss. He initially tries to distance himself from the family business as much as possible, but he slowly gets drawn in, until his father passes control of the family down to him. So what is it about this movie that makes it such a classic? (""Everything"" would be too obvious and brief, so I'll try to go into more detail.)The best part of this movie is, of course, the acting. Marlon Brando is fantastic as Don Vito, so obviously he really deserved his win of the Best Actor Oscar. (Although he infamously refused the award as a protest against Native Americans' portrayals in film) He really sells the fact that he is a powerful man, but also isn't as bad as one would think, and just cares about the family. Al Pacino as Michael is excellent in all his subtlety, as he goes through his transformation from a really nice guy into the ruthless head of the family. (Although from what I've heard, he goes even further in Part II, which I have yet to see) Diane Keaton as Kay, Michael's girlfriend really manages to stand out in her supporting role despite being surrounded by amazing screen legends in the main roles. James Caan as Sonny is fantastic, Robert Duvall as Tom is great, Richard S. Castellano as Clemenza is just as good, I could go on forever, but I need to finish this up.Another great part of the movie is the script, (Based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo) which wisely knows to focus on and develop the characters, which are very well aided by the fine performances of the cast. The film lets us spend a lot of time with these characters until we feel we know them as well as our own family. (Okay, not QUITE that far, but you get the idea) The way the script handles these characters is brilliant: Despite the fact that they are in the Mafia, they are not necessarily evil. The movie spends a lot of time with them, and they seem like really nice people. (Well, except for the other families) And whenever the characters tell a story, because of how interesting the script makes the characters and their stories, all you have in your head is that story, and it even feels like its own movie.The film has a really memorable score by Nino Rota; it doesn't have to be big or bombastic, it doesn't need to have a bunch of choir members singing frantically, it is more relaxed and melancholy. The cinematography by Gordon Willis is really beautiful, with plenty of shades of orange that perfectly complement the violence and gore of the different murders throughout the film. (Which aren't terribly brutal, but definitely for ages 14 and up) And the film is pretty well edited as well: Despite its long length, it rarely feels like it is three hours long, and when it occasionally slows down, those moments are really far between, and fairly brief. The only real complaint I have about the movie is that some things happen that I felt could have been explained a little more, but that's just me nitpicking.So overall, ""The Godfather"" is flat out amazing, I can't compliment this movie enough. Nearly everything about it is perfect, I give it a 10/10.(But seriously, this only won 3 Oscars? Are you kidding me?)"
5487,False,"THE GODFATHER,"" which has been re-released on its 25th anniversary, is a jewel that still glows across time -- and in the dark. Gordon Willis's cinematography, considered revolutionary at the time, plunged its characters into pools of semi-darkness. Studio executives -- always the last ones to get it -- howled in the screening rooms. But in this saga of an Italian-American family's bid for power, we were watching the American Dream operating in the darkest shadows.Luckily, America saw the light. The movie, released in March 1972 and directed by an unknown eccentric called Francis Ford Coppola, was a smash hit -- the first film to top $100 million in its initial release. It won three Academy Awards (for Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Screenplay Adaptation). It lit a fire under the careers of Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire. It entered the pantheon of American cinema; and it has informed virtually every crime movie in the last quarter century, from ""Scarface"" to ""Donnie Brasco.""In the story, which Mario Puzo and Coppola adapted from Puzo's novel, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) presides over a tight-knit clan which includes his hotheaded eldest son, Sonny (James Caan), his adopted son and family adviser, Tom Hagen (Duvall), and youngest son, Michael (Pacino), the apple of his father's eye who has -- thus far -- been kept out of the family business.That business happens to be prostitution, protection rackets and gambling. In a constant struggle for power among New York's rival gangster families, Don Corleone rules with Machiavellian grace.When adversaries refuse his wishes, he ""makes them an offer they can't refuse."" The procedure is simple: His goons point a gun against the head of anyone who needs persuasion. But Don Corleone is also a benevolent figure who -- in this morally relative underworld -- rights the wrongs of his friends and relatives.Into this world comes Michael, the returning war hero (the year is 1946), who finally agrees to take his father's mantle and run the family. His ascension is the stuff of American cinematic myth. Standing before his father, who lies in a hospital bed after barely surviving an attempt on his life, Michael kisses Don Corleone's hand and whispers, ""I'm with you now.""Coppola, then in his thirties, reluctantly heeded the advice of his friend George Lucas to make this picture. To him, this was a commercially unpalatable project that had nothing to do with his personal ambition: to change the way Hollywood made movies.How wrong he was. There are volumes that could be written -- and have been -- about the movie's uniformly powerful performances; its precedent-setting editing by William Reynolds and Peter Zinner; Nino Rota's haunting score; and Dean Tavoularis's evocative set design. But Coppola must get most of the credit.With Puzo, he forged an epic tragedy about America, capitalism, family, greed, treachery and love. He showed us -- with almost Shakespearean gravitas -- the errors of hasty vengeance and the wisdom of assured leadership. He gave us a great American picture, full of incredible images and lasting moments. There are too many to choose from, but I leave you with two here: When Michael -- hearing about the assault on his father -- scrambles into a telephone booth to call the family, his girlfriend (Diane Keaton) waits outside in the cold. It's clear that she's literally being kept out of the picture. Much later, when a door is closed between her and her husband -- as he conducts family business -- this estrangement is not only reconfirmed, it sets us up for ""The Godfather, Part II,"" a movie that achieved the impossible: to equal its predecessor."
5488,False,"This Movie is Awesome. Every character has done Justice. Story line is perfect. I have never seen any Movie better than this one. This is like a BluePrint for the Movies of this Genre. Francis Ford Coppola,Al Pacino,Marlon Brando all of them created History. It keeps viewers guessing what will happen next,every second of this 175 minutes movie has kept audience excited. This Movie has everything like family, loyalty, greed, relationships, Love,Betrayal,Gun Shot,Romance. The plot excellent for it to get ten out of ten, I give this movie ten out of ten, as I stated earlier it's far from predictable.It is a real piece of gold which will shine for the life time.A must watch movie for the movie lovers."
5489,False,"Probably the greatest film of all times. This film is, in my opinion, absolutely perfect: Coppola's best direction, fantastic photography, perfectly acted by all the cast, thrilling story...This cinema classic is a must-see film, from the beginning to the end. There are lots of influences from the genre classics, but it is at the same time original and surprising.Its violence is brutal but not just for fun, there is just the necessary to show the criminal world, which is perfectly represented here.This film is so great you can watch it more than one time, and you're not going to get tired of it. You'll find even more details in every scene, so it's a perfect film to have at home, because yo'll enjoy watching it a lot of times. I recommend the Blu-ray edition, which is really good."
5490,False,"This should always be on top, The movie is classy stuff, Don Corleone is the best, And you will surely remember his quotes after the movie is over, Later on al pacino catches up in great pace I have seen all 3 part and i believe this is the best Of all. God Father "" I will make him a deal he cannot reject"" To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same."
5491,False,"The Godfather is a not just a film but its a movement, it defines the past of the Italian American culture. A past that many American Italians are ashamed of but a past that I think the American people should know about. Any Italian could tell you that the principles of family that are portrayed in this film reflect the traditions of the old country. Family comes first before anything, this is a value that is passed down from generation to generation in the Italian culture, it was good to see that Coppola portrayed this in such a strong manner. It takes filming to a whole new level and changed the way we see films. Brando, Deniro and Pacino are genius! The acting compliments the impeccable work of Francis Ford Coppola. In my books this is a must see film, the book is not so bad either. The work of Coppola makes a long film seem like minutes."
5492,False,"What a masterpiece, hope this all movie series will never be forgotten and every person who respects and deserves honor should have all collection at home. Greatest actors of all times played their parts Perfect! A movie means a lot of emotion. The perspective of life is very decisive in a 'Capo' life like Godfather's because danger strikes at every time when you aspect the most little of all. I'd love to see the movie over and over again, the originality hidden underneath it is barely visible. I hope that every person who wants a lesson for life could watch this masterpiece and see the hardest moments in life are made for toughness, to go in battle with life and win the battle, or at least try to . I wish i could've been in those years when the life was a lot more tougher than it is nowadays. Look at all the people that don't give respect but are pretending to have it but they do not do a thing for having it. Anyway, a masterpiece will heavily remain in our hearts among these special actors."
5493,False,"I recently watched this film on Christmas Eve to pass some time before the big day and i can say i wasn't disappointing this film received 9.2 on this website which in my opinion is a bit overrated however it is still a hell of a movie the main plot behind this masterpiece is that ""The Godfather"" (Brando) is getting old and wants to pass on the family business to his son (Pacino)however Pacino is not to keen on it at first grows to understand what he must do. This film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola and it stars Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan & Talia Shire.I highly recommend this movie so far i has seen this and The Godfather part 2 and they are both good films but i am yet to watch the 3rd one.****/*****"
5494,False,"Hello movie freaks, this is my first ever movie review on IMDb. As I am novice in writing, excuse me for my unintelligent writing. As a first review post I wanted to choose an important and popular movie, so I choose THE GODFATHER.This is only a film where audience can attach emotionally to a DON's life.Film starts with a sequence where people came to greet and meet Don Vito Carleone and request him to fulfill their desires. In between the scenes we got to know that all the visitors came to attend the wedding of Don's daughter.It would have been very important occasion in any father's life but even at this occasion also Don shows his generosity and kindness who came to his asylum. This film shows how man is hunger for power and how a man turned violent to protect his family.THE GODFATHER is best of all his genres not only for its story but also for performances,editing,cinematography and above all for its direction. I don't think that other then the Francis Ford Coppola could have done this."

5496,False,"This is the most Original movies ever made! Nothing can beat it. Good actors. Good set up. Everything is GREAT! If you want to spend your time. Watch it! If you want to spend your money. buy it! You cant get better then this. All mafia movies don't get closer to this one. So don't think that other mafia movies are better. Al Pacino. he takes to whole movie over. It cant be better with him. This movie gets a lot of awards, and of it is old. For me it can have more awards then it already haves. This movie don't need any special effect. For its old fashion look it haves more character. Get it in the movie store fast if you can."
5497,False,"Aged head of the Corleone crime family, Vito Corleone has known peace and power through violence in his clandestine criminal dynasty. When fate intervenes and sends the family into turmoil, it is his most reluctant of sons who must take over the mantle of Godfather to not only keep his family alive but keep there power intact as well.One of the most acclaimed masterpiece's of film history The Godfather is a visually stunning, beautifully performed and expertly crafted film. Bringing its viewer into 1940's New York the viewer can't help but feel as though it was actually filmed within that period. Based off the acclaimed novel by Mario Puzzo, Coppola directs some of the silver screens legends in some of their finest performances. Brando delivers in his most iconic role that will leave you wanting more after the final credits roll. Pacino in what many consider his break out role shows you, the viewer why he will become one of the best performers of a generation, and James Caan delivers in what many consider his finest performance of his career. Spawning two sequels and legions of fans worldwide, this classic has not only held the test of time but remains to this day one of the finest films every created. Anyone who considers themselves a true film buff needs to have seen this timeless classic."
5498,False,"It captures a dark world,at it's darkest and most violent,yet there are moments of beauty sprinkled throughout.This is what I enjoyed about The Godfather.I'm not a huge fan of mafia themed films,but I will give this film credit for presenting it with such realism.We get lost in it's realities and we forget often throughout the film that it is,in fact just a movie and that it is all play acting.I was wowed by how well casted it was and how well suited for their characters each actor was,in particular Marlon Brando.For all of it's dark theme and violent content,The Godfather still manages to come out looking like a true masterpiece."
5499,False,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 41 years old and has aged well.This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic."
5500,False,"For this work alone, Francis Ford Coppola will be talked about as one of the greatest directors of all time. Never before has a more masterful film been created. However, the conclusion of the trilogy has blemished the name of ""Godfather."" But this great work remains untouched by hatred, garnering a 100 out of a possible score of 100 with critics on this site. It cannot be put better than that. The Godfather is the perfect film. This work stands as one of few that could never and will never be remade or recreating. Simply put, this is the greatest movie ever made. Don't get me wrong, The Shawshank Redemption is an amazing movie, but I don't see how tops or even compares to The Godfather. This movie should be at the top of the Top 250."
5501,False,"""The Godfather"" is the perfect film. The 1970s was the greatest decade in the history of motion pictures for turning out masterpieces. Above all else, what captures the viewers in this movie--arguably the decade's premier masterpiece--is the stark dichotomy of family bonds versus terrible betrayal. ""The Godfather"" causes viewers to be enthralled by the harshest possible realization of moral relativism that could possibly be imagined. But admittedly, it is our connection to and fascination with the Corleone family--every bit as dysfunctional, violent, and disturbing as one would picture an organized crime family to be--is what makes this film only more beloved and respected as the years pass on. For example, when fans of the film discuss what they love about the movie, the expected level of disturbing violence in it is rarely mentioned as being remarkable. What fans remember most is the great writing and the spectacular performances. Fans are thrilled to see a dark side of American life from a distance and that very few people ever see all while they root for their beloved Corleones. ""The Godfather"" has stood the test of time, and it always will."
5502,False,"I recently watched the film The Godfather directed by Francis Ford Coppolla and based on the book by Mario Puzo. The film stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall. The film takes place in New York in a post-World War II setting. The films is a stirring drama filled with poignant moments throughout.This film follows the lives of the Corleone family who is one of the five organized crime families that control the city and state of New York. This film takes you through the good and the bad sides of an organized crime family. The film has moments where you forget that this family is a mob family who commits murders like others commit minor traffic violations. Some of the more memorable scenes in the movie include the very opening scene in the movie when The Godfather (Vito Corleone) is sitting in a dark home office setting where he is receiving any guest to his daughter's wedding who has a request for him. Apparently there is an old Sicilian tradition that says that a father cannot refuse any reasonable request on the day that his daughter is to be married. Why haven't I been invited to more Italian weddings? I'm getting really tired of dealing with my wife telling me to clean up after I make a mess. Where is a Godfather when you need him? Another scene that caught my attention is a meeting that the Corleone family has with a man by the name of Sollozzo. This man has an offer for the family to begin moving the family into the drug business. The scene gets me because you would think that a mob boss would be up for whatever if it means making money, but not Don Corleone. He almost seems like a respectable business man who would not do anything that has to do with drugs. This scene is pivotal as it sets in motion the events of the rest of the movie. Upon the refusal of Sollozzo's offer he sets up an assassination attempt on The Godfather's life which is carried out but fails as the Don lives through the attempt. After the assassination attempt there has to be a reaction from the family and to everyone's surprise this gets Michael Corleone involved in the family business that he swore he would never be involved with. Michael's involvement leads him to carry out the assassination of Sollozzo and the chief of police. This act of vengeance leads Michael to a yearlong hide out in Italy while the rest of the family and their associates go to the mats for a bitter mob war. There are many other moments in the film to be seen and the film moves in a very unpredictable way that has to be seen rather than told in a film review.One of the best aspects of the movie is the background music that plays at certain times in the movie. It is nothing that is going to blow you away, and it isn't anything that you are going to recognize unless you are familiar with some sort of dark orchestra that I have never heard of before. The movie plays music at the right times and it does an amazing job of building the suspense of the scenes where it has been included. One example is toward the end of the movie when Michael's nephew is being baptized and the movie is going through a series of parallel cuts and the music does an amazing job of building the suspense during this scene. This is a classic example of someone doing their homework and realizing that sometimes music can be done to the point of overkill. No worries of that here just a great job by the sound crew.Another fine job in the movie is the acting. The cast of this movie was brilliantly put together and each character is played absolutely brilliantly. From The Godfather down to the Mafioso's who work for him each character is played with precision and by men and women who seem to fit the roles that they were cast for as if they were leading their normal lives. The casting crew gets a round of applause from me for the job that they did with this film.The Godfather is a film that will stand the test of time when it comes to motion pictures. With a brilliant plot and a moving storyline this movie is one of the best that I have ever seen. The characters portray a group that seem for all intents and purposes to be a real family who love and care about one another while going about their daily lives of committing murders and breaking the law. This film will be one of the greats of all time and it will leave viewers with a sense of wanting to be a part of a crime syndicate like the Corleone family. I encourage anyone who enjoys movies that tell a story in a moving and powerful way to go and see The Godfather. I promise that you will not be disappointed and you will be begging for more by the time that the movie is over. My overall film rating for this movie is a resounding 5 out of 5 trigger fingers because I think that they work better for this movie than stars or thumbs. Go see the movie and enjoy!"
5503,False,"Well where to begin this film for me is the pinnacle of film. Its beautiful in every way. The music, acting, scenery, is virtually perfect. Marlon Brando for me gives the stand out performance in a fantastic cast. The film is captivating from start to finish. There really isn't enough praise I can give for this film, it really deserves its name in the greatest films of all time, if not THE greatest. The film does a brilliant job at immersing you into the story of the Corleone family. You will struggle to find a film as engrossing and powerful as this one. I only wish films of today where made with such passion and brilliance. 10/10 a must watch for any film fan."
5504,False,"When the godfather came out, the world wasn't ready for it, it was dark, greedy and brutally violent. Today, it's recognized as one of Hollywood's best and the father of the blockbuster and the reason is it's game-changing imagery and plot. Without the godfather, there wouldn't be violence in modern cinema or epic crime dramas, there wouldn't be great movies that score millions and there wouldn't be the francis ford coppola that we know today. So, we must thank to the brilliance behind it that made American cinema what it is today. The writing is superb, te performances memorable and the directing and cinematography are outstanding. Thank you for reading SIGNED : The movie geek"
5505,False,I love to think that dramas start one way and finish another but this movie leaves you at the edge of you seat. Love the cast as well! I love the dramatic scenes hype the memorable scenes as well and the way people are able to convey their feelings without it being overbearing. the energy and magic is defined. i love how the scenes are laid out. i love old movies and I love romance films mixed with thriller. So this is definitely one of my all time favorites. I would recommend it to anyone young and old. There are some intense scenes as well. I would love to one day be in a movie sort of like this. But it would add such a flavor that people wouldn't expect it. I also like the idea of a super natural being who has many sides that we haven;t fully figured out. I am a movie lover and this is by far one of my favorites. I think when creating my own trailer I want to take small hints of sadness and hope like this film and include it in mine
5506,False,"A number of factors are just designed to end up being ideal, sleek as well as nicely, godly. This Godfather, through Francis Kia Coppola as well as Mario Puzo is actually. Just how all facets involving filmmaking as well as storytelling enhances the other within this unforgettable motion picture leads to that you ask yourself ( really) if such a task might be repeated, actually.I possess the maximum value for your software prior to everything related to videos, therefore Let me look at Godfather's script initial.Used from Mario Puzo's book in the very same identify This Godfather is dependant on the man's relationship along with his family members as well as his / her responsibilties to that, that could result in your pet in order to forego her own dreams as well as aspirations. That this build is actually put on show through one of the most highly effective mafia individuals with 1940s Nyc causes it to be all the more fascinating.The easy piece getting that the head in the Corleone criminal offenses family members is actually ageing as well as other criminal offenses companies would like your pet out of the way looks quite simple. Key in Wear Vito Corleone's littlest kid Erina also called 'the not liable university boy' - seeing that his / her parent buddy as well as apparent heir Sonny Corleone loves to telephone your pet - in addition to a young lady. They sums upward his / her living as well as that he / she desires from using it with foreseeable future available as one line - ""This is actually our kids Kay, not necessarily everyone. inch Rather plainly the kid wishes practically nothing about his / her criminal offenses family members or even it is electric power.

Right after Vito refuses to manage the narcotics kingpin named Virgil Sollozo, he / she cause the string involving situations of which varies his / her family members as well as enterprise design once and for all. Obviously any good male that has encountered that living may offer ceases to see what exactly is forthcoming as well as states his / her amaze later on.A new tragic as well as intellect numbing account involving what sort of highly effective criminal offenses family members comes to terminology together with that that nourishes with as well as the way the very same organizations practically eliminate the household seemed to be, is actually and may keep on being unforgettable."
5507,False,"I see that this show is #2 on the list of successful movies at IMDb so it would be impossible for me to more flatter it. I saw this movie when I was in Junior High School. My parents were all about Law School at the University and my feeling was this was a hero movie about an outlaw. There is a frightening scene in this movie about a horse's head being found in the bed of the Godfather's enemy's bed. Crossing the Godfather is forbidden, per Se, and he defends his Italian Mafia friends with a machine gun. And, I think it looked like a foreign film because it takes place in a rich castle on luxurious estate. The Godfather character in this film was a likable, ""regular person's"" advocate. I had Italian people in my family (as well as Gangsters in my school). By the way, as a result of my literary studies, I have found God is synonymous with dog so Godfather is a derogatory slang term."
5508,False,"This movie is strong, great casting, excellent directing! I saw this movie when I was 15 years old and it's left great impression. Francis Ford Coppola made really excellent screen version of very seriously book. Book very interesting and serious give representation ambiance of mafia family. But director managed to add drama in that story. Many of the scenes of the book in movie are absent. And the story of the horse head, very surprised me. What about main role: Marlon Brando played are very vividly, like if he was made for this role. I'm also was exciting after ""Apocalypse Now"". This masterpiece wasn't screen version of book, but Francis Ford Coppola took an idea of the movie in Joseph Conrad book - ""Heart of Darkness"". The movie, not story but movie, turned in masterpiece of Francis Ford Coppola, thanks to his amaing directing."
5509,False,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a clich√©. His performance though was not a clich√©. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake."
5510,False,"One of the many things that stand the test of time in this Film is how the rich and deeply colored softness of the image doesn't seem at all dated, in fact, it is a beautiful way of peddling the presentation. A testament to its Artistic framing. It is the Art of the Godfather that along with the Characters and the forbidden, to outsiders, World of the Mafia that make this a memorable monument to the craft of Filmmaking.The period detail and the Casting are another spot on representation of these larger than Life Characters and their primal environment. So there is the look, the Actors, the semi-whispered dialog in tightly confined rooms, the verboten landscape, and the fact that these People are not real but are a realization of expectations and surprises.This may not be the best Film of all time, can a claim like that for any one Movie be taken seriously, but it is certainly a most finely crafted work of Art. Its influence can hardly be measured, and although the Director only came close to the two Godfather Movies with the incredible Apocalypse Now (1979), he will forever be noticed as the creative force behind Godfather and Godfather II that are both worthy inclusions in any Best Films list."
5511,False,"Regarded as one of the most important and influential films of the century. This film has definitely changed the way gangster films are created. Back in the golden days of cinema, gangster films were notable for their violence and profanity. The Godfather changed the way contemporary gangster or crime films are approached. I don't want the review of this film be based on the film's impact but rather focusing on the film on its own.The film's story is based on a novel by Mario Puzo and written for the screen by Francis Ford Coppola. Puzo's novel has been, before the film, has been a commercial and critical hit. I have not read Puzo's novel but Coppola's writing for this film is definitely entertaining. The film may have metaphors and deep layered themes but to me, it wasn't something I was looking for, as the story of this family is so damn entertaining that it did not need to be layered to be interesting. The strongest areas of this film focuses on the structure and functioning of the family business. The film also depicts the rise of Michael Corleone and how different he becomes when he becomes involved in the business he never wanted to be in the first place.Francis Ford Coppola has created the most acclaimed films of all time and all seem to be confined in the decade of the 70's. Each one of those films, aside from the Godfather sequel, is completely different from one another and at least one will appeal to a person. Coppola focused a lot on the culture and family aspect of this film which made this something unique. Though different from previous gangster films, it did not sacrifice on the areas that makes it exciting like the violence and tension. It still focuses on the competing families and the betrayal that is familiar in the genre. Brilliant direction has allowed every scene to be important in driving the story, there is no scene that does not drive anything for either the characters or the plot.Gordon Willis' cinematography feels like a picture or a video from an old camera that has aged. The film is dominated by a golden hue that gives the film that feeling of age.The film successfully feels like a period film and immerses you in the time period of the 1940's. Scenes like the wedding and the baptism are breathtaking. Willis has added in the film's lasting power as there are very few films that captures a moment in time so well as what he did for The Godfather and it's sequel.The film may feel slow to some people but I feel that it's important as it allows for characters to develop and the story to have more breathing room. The film is driven in detailed and intricate performances rather than spectacular and grand moments.How many of you have watched this film or at the very least heard the theme and gets stuck on your head for hours after you've heard it. As I am writing this, it's playing in my head. The score is something that would be heard in funerals or some other sad dramatic moment. The score is stays faithful to the film's cultural roots and at the same time making it something that sounds from a classic gangster films. Due to the film's score being so memorable and effective, it has become something composers of films in the same genre to go back to, in creating their scores.Iconic role played by an iconic actor. Vito Corleone can never be pictured played by another actor aside from Marlon Brando. The actor has played characters that are typical from leading actors and so seeing him in a character that was definitely at least 10 to 15 years older than his own during production, was a revelation. He embodied this respected and vulnerable man, and without a doubt outshone every actor in this film. Pacino was great as Michael but I felt he shows more of his acting capabilities in the second and third film. The entire cast works well together and each performance can be labeled as their most strongest in their career.This is one of the best films from Coppola. I cannot say this is his magnum opus because other films he has written and directed, Apocalypse Now and The Godfather Part II, are equally as powerful. The Godfather is an example of an amazing story, brilliantly acted and excellent direction in adapting an already iconic novel."
5512,False,"One of the best if not even the best movie about mafia (Along with part I and part II). A Oscar awarded movie,it might be old (1972) but I still recommend it to everybody. The actors Marlon Brando and Al Pacino will be for ever remembered for their part in this movie as Don Vito Corleone (Godfather) and Michael Corleone (his son that eventually became Godfather)Respect for the Writer , Director of the movie , Actors and everybody else that was on the set , they did a amazing job that has marked everybody that saw the Godfather series. Well done !This movie has to be seen at least once in a lifetime !Do not miss this movie !"
5513,False,"As much as I would like to do justice for this movie - there is little I can say that will help people understand the grandeur of this film. The Godfather sends you through a riveting journey into the life of one of the five great families. And with a cast as breathtakingly awe-inspiring as this, you are bound to be on the edge of your seat from the very first wedding scene.The plot of the movie is in itself fantastic, but it should not go unmentioned how it is not only a good movie - but a very realistic depiction of the harsh life of the criminal organizations, and their internal structure based mostly on nepotism.The soundtrack (which is too often ignored as an important aspect of storytelling in these reviews) by Nino Rota perfectly underlines the true sadness of this intricate storyline."
5514,False,"If you lived in Sicily over the last 3,000 years you'd be pretty used to death and devastation by now. Sicily is bang smack in the middle of three prominent pre-Christian empires: the Greek post-Alexander Hellenistic empire, the Roman Empire and the Carthagian-Lavantine Empire. All three of them fought tooth and nail for 3 centuries to control Sicily. And I haven't mentioned yet the tyrants who used to rule Sicilian cities such as Syracuse, for whom the Greek engineer Archimedes worked. Then came the bully-boy, Normans, the Hapsburg Empire, Napoleon, Mussolini, the Nazis...oh where does it end?In other words, dying, or threatening others with death, is just something else to do on a Sunday afternoon in Sicily. The Sicilians also learnt how to barter with their masters of the day, and how to subjugate their own.Transfer all of this to a quiet neighbourhood of New York City, and it's like trusting King Kong into the city to clean the windows of the Empire State Building. The Godfather, adapted from Mario Puzo's novel, shows how capable the Sicilian Mafia are at subduing the authorities to run their own profiteering rackets. But what's interesting is how after the Godfather was shown, how the authorities decided they had had enough of being manipulated by Sicilians. It wasn't long before they put every effort into suppressing these usurpers. The US authorities regained the role the Greeks, Romans and Carthagians had once held.Sicilian management is impressive, but not as impressive as good old Dutch-Anglo-Saxon mastery of all things profitable.A point of interest, the decapitation of the horse-head scene in this movie has its foundation in Roman Chariot racing on The Field Of Mars. One of the winning horses would be sacrificed, it's blood mixed with the bodies of the unborn children and its head nailed to the door of the Forum."
5515,False,"THE GODFATHERA long time ago I started to watch these movies and got about an hour into The Godfather and was really bored so I turned it off... until now.I liked it... but it was long! I'm pretty sure it could have been shrunk down to 2 hours.There are some really good scenes in this movie. The hits that are made on various people were really well done for it's time. Don't get me wrong, you could see the blood wasn't real, but back when this was made i am pretty sure they didn't have the effects and make up we have now.The story was really good, but it was a very slow paced movie. It took a while for the movie to get going. There is a lot of dialogue and if you listen to it properly and get into the movie you will enjoy it.The Corleone family is a family you don't want to mess with. They take no prisoners. If you are their friends they will look after you, but if you get on their wrong side, you won't live long enough to regret it.The casting was really good. Marlon Brando played the Godfather, Don Vito Corleone. This was the best role he has played that I have seen so far. Al Pacino played his son Michael. A brilliant performance. He looks so young in this film... I nearly didn't recognise him. James Caan played another son, Sonny. I am not a huge James Caan fan, but he did well in this movie.The Godfather is not the best gangster movie I have ever seen. I think Goodfellas is still the best in my opinion. But I can understand why this is a classic. This was probably the first big gangster film.I loved the soundtrack too... the theme to this film is legendary. I have listened to it a lot. Slash plays it on guitar really well at his concerts.I will give this film a 7 out of 10.A good movie, but a mission to watch due to the length. I will be watching The Godfather Part II very soon.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204"
5516,False,"I recently watched the 1968 French film ""The Two of Us"" directed by Claude Berri, which tells of the development of a relationship between an anti-Semetic old man in the country who becomes the guardian of a young Jewish boy during World War II. (Actually, the title of the French movie translates better to ""The Old Man and the Boy"".) To me, it appears that the scenes in ""The Godfather"" where Vito is an old man in a garden playing with a young boy with a spray can were very much informed by this French film. The film would certainly have been available to Coppola and Brando during the filming of ""The Godfather"". Although it may be stretching things a bit, the actor who portrays the old man in the French film has a very distinct chin, and it may be that Brando came up with the idea of putting tissues in his jowls from observing that actor. I wonder if others have spotted these similarities."
5517,False,"This isn't the first time I have seen this film, but circumstances have given me a chance to see it in a new light.I bought a Blu Ray player, and this film was recommended as the film to see in the new format. I was not disappointed. The richness of the color made the film an extreme pleasure.I also watched it with captions to not miss a word of the dialog.There is nothing new that can be said about this film. It is a classic, and the actors are all superb, as is the story itself. It is rare that a film like this comes around, and watching it in Blue Ray just made it all extra special."
5518,False,"i just don't get the big deal with this film. i watched it once and it was OK, worth the watch but not the kind of film i think you could watch more than once. i defo don't think it merited a place in the top 10 films of all time. Also, marlon brando...i don't get it. yeah he was a GOOD actor, but i would never consider him a GREAT actor. and his part in this just seemed lacked something that should be there, i just didn't find him memorable. i suppose overall i didn't get this film the way others did, or is it just a case of people think they should like it so they just say that they do? i know that when people talk about it around me i don't voice my true opinion of it in fear of being hung by a mob :P"
5519,False,"As an epic movie marathon I watched The Godfather Trilogy back to back recently. I had not seen any of the Godfather pictures for over ten years, so very few images were etched in my mind and I could come to the pictures once again with a fresh perspective. The Godfather (1972) begins at a slow absorbing pace with a wedding scene seeming to go on forever. The opening monologue is gripping and gently draws you in to the underworld that is to be exposed. Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone commands the screen with ease and is truly convincing. The first real surprise is how miscast Diane Keaton is in the role of Kay Adams, Michael Corleone's girlfriend. Keaton is out of her depth. Her acting is poor and at odds with the authenticity of the rest of the cast. The diminutive Pachino set against the taller Keaton is another oddity, which takes away from Michael Corleone's stature. I found all of The Godfather to be compelling but for the scenes with Keaton, which felt weak and unconvincing. This picture does have a wonderful performance by Al Pachino and his skills as an actor are understated and never ""showy"" as he would later become. His best acting comes when he hugs his brothers goodbye before he leaves to take out his revenge.I also noticed some really poor continuity particularly when Santino 'Sonny' Corleone beats up his brother-in-law in a street. The punches are clearly seen to not connect and his kicks are pulled and theatrical. This scene takes away from the efforts at real and graphic violence, which up until this point had been convincing. The Godfather Part II (1974) starts with a distinctly different narrative style than its predecessor with flash-backs to the rise of Don Vito Corleone. These scenes are theatrical yet engaging. Once Vito Corleone played brilliantly by Robert De Niro begins his assent, the film takes on an alternate life of it's own. The scene with the repugnant Landlord being a highlight. Pachino's problems as the new head of the family run concurrently with the flashbacks but they have less power and focus particularly during his business in Cuba. The trials of Michael Corleone are the best sequences involving Pachino. Again Keaton is out of her depth. She has more of a subtle look than in the first instalment but her acting is only slightly better. The scenes in which she is involved are again the weakest of the picture. Godfather Part 3 (1990) is a disaster. Now, instead of one casting faux pas, Coppola gives us another with his own daughter playing Mary Corleone. This fatal error should have been corrected as early as the first screen test. Sophia is simply not convincing in the role and the cries of nepotism transcend the picture. Apart from the casting debacle, the script of Godfather Part III goes against the themes so well established in the first two movies. Rather than Michael Corleone becoming more desensitised or heartless, he becomes remorseful and tries to repent for his past bad deeds. The idea that Michael Corleone regards family as of the highest import rings hollow considering that he sanctioned the murder of his own brother. Part III would have been better if it showed the assent of his son Anthony Vito Corleone within the family business. Michael's blind love for his son does not allow him to see that his boy is malleable and disloyal. He hangs around with the wrong types, is reckless and arrogant, avoids education, possibly expelled for violence. There are more warning signs from trusted Corleone associates but they go unheeded by Michael. So the downfall of Michael Corleone is at the hands of his own son, who sells out his father and betrays him for power and control. Michael is assassinated and his son assumes he will now become the next head of the business but all along he has been ""played"" and so is brutally murdered. So ends the reign of the Corelone family. Part III as it stands, is so terrible that it is almost unwatchable. The final scene with Pachino as an old man is comic in the extreme. What a crying shame! What a ridiculous way to end what could have been the best trilogy in cinema history."
5520,False,"This Movie is Awesome. Every character has done Justice. Story line is perfect. I have never seen any Movie better than this one. This is like a BluePrint for the Movies of this Genre. Francis Ford Coppola,Al Pacino,Marlon Brando all of them created History. It keeps viewers guessing what will happen next,every second of this 175 minutes movie has kept audience excited. This Movie has everything like family, loyalty, greed, relationships, Love,Betrayal,Gun Shot,Romance. The plot excellent for it to get ten out of ten, I give this movie ten out of ten, as I stated earlier it's far from predictable.It is a real piece of gold which will shine for the life time.A must watch movie for the movie lovers."
5521,False,the godfather is easily one of if not the best film in cinema history everyone gives great performances easily Marlon Brando and AL Pacino Frances ford Coppola directs the film well and everything is great the story is great and so is the film the story is convincing and many iconic performances and lines are featured James Caan and Robert Duvall give great performances the godfather truly deserves to be on the top of the greatest movie lists the plot interesting and manages to keep you watching throughout the film summary a stunning masterpiece that has changed movies forever and is easily going to be remembered forever the godfather is easily the best of the Trilodgy and was better than the best film of 1972 it could be the best film ever made the godfather is also good form watching before the godfather part 2
5522,False,"Such is the outlandishness and exuberance of The Godfather, that it is able to branch one of its more lower key characters off onto a tangent that is detached from the primary narrative strand based in New York, in the 1950s and sees the film revolve around the Corleone Family; and have this character shifted to the Italian island of Sicily as he lays low; meets new people and ultimately feels raw human emotion. He learns this through falling in love and suffering a sudden tragedy, an event that shocks both him and us, the audience. Such is the grand scope of the film whilst the character is Michael Corleone, the actor is Al Pacino and the film is The Godfather, a setting up of a grand tale revolving around an organised crime outfit in the latter years of the 20th Century.Michael is, of course, laying low because of the organised hit on certain individuals he put himself up to back in New York. I think up to that point, Michael had been a character involved, but not in a particularly spectacular manner, in the film but that consequent event and 'hiding' embeds him into 'the life'; it is his own point of no return that captures the essence of loyalty to one's family when the chance arises to show your worth, but at the same time acts as a demonstration of how easily it is for these people to, despite telling most involved that they're 'straight', get involved in the nastier side of life that others close to them are ultimately involved in.The series' sprawling, but in a good sense, study of life in crime several decades ago begins with 1972's The Godfather and at the rather distinct locale of a wedding, perhaps signifying what all weddings should signify: a beginning, a new beginning as the long and unknown road lies ahead ¬ñ there will be good times, great times but bad times as we advance into the supposed unknown. Such is a synopsis of either Mafia life and the healthy-one-minute-dead-the-next ideation of life in organised crime as well as life following marriage as you venture off into the next chapter with 'the one' at your side. The scenic and pleasant setting of the wedding sees the film immediately establish a juxtaposition of the pleasant; of the upbeat and of the enjoyable clashing with the fact behind closed doors, despite the occasion, gangsters lurk discussing sordid prior activity and acts of brutal retribution in light of these acts.Initially, I think we're supposed to assume the film is about the very man sitting in his office; listening to stories delivered by people who do not (cannot) demand, but crave, action. The Don, Vito Corleone (Brando), sits and listens to whether the situation demands attention. Eventually he deems the immediate opening tale worthy of such Mob retaliation but for a favour in the future. There is a certain nonchalance, an establishing of power in these first scenes, that being before it branches out into the wedding and then into life amongst the Corleone family itself. Additionally, it is said that Vito has contacts in the music industry while a certain humane side to Vito is brought through via the fact it's established he brought into the family an orphan off of the street.But while Vito is the most powerful and the most inspirational character in the film, it isn't necessarily about him. Indeed, early on his adopted son Tom Hagen (Duvall) is engaging with others more than most others, a right hand-man for Vito and a lawyer all the same as he hears and helps deal with the issues and problems that arise for the family. But no, the film isn't really about him either rather it is about organised crime as a whole and how it engulfs these people and what they do. Too much happens in the film to list here, but it is a film driven not by pre-figured plot routines but by acts of honour, betrayal and the realistic decisions made by characters we believe are true to life or 'real'. They act on impulse but stay true to the consistency of their mindsets with Michael's sudden urge to take part in an organised 'hit' acting as a particular event, not because Michael is any sort of protagonist and must propel action, but because prior events to do with a targeted and consequentially injured character and Michael's attitudes to this injured character have built up a certain antagonism within Michael's usually cool mindset.Amongst all this, Michael's romance with a woman named Kay (Keaton) is slotted in rather nicely and, like everything else, is developed at its own pace with assured direction from Coppola. The film doesn't really posses an overly complicated narrative and the events are told in a linear format, but the achievement is in getting across this epic sense of progression. It is the getting under the skin of a lifestyle that we watch, the emotional and natural progression of a family, only difference being that this family are a New York based Mafia organisation but with an equally fascinating tale to tell."
5523,False,"I really liked ""The Godfather"" and the content of the movie. But, I think that this movie is overrated. Back in the 70's, this might have been the greatest movie ever. But in 2009, it's not.This film talks about the rivalry between the 5 Italian mafia families living in New York City. The main focus is on the Corleone family. After the patriarch of the family got shot, the youngest son Michael joins the family business for vengeance.The acting is definitely not overrated. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan all delivered marvelous performances that will be remembered forever.The score by Nino Rota is probably one of the most famous and the one that is stuck inside your head for months.One thing I have against this movie is that this movie is very long with boring scenes stretched in. This movie is nearly three hours long. I can accept that for the last LOTR movie because it's interesting and engaging.Overall, this is a great film, not exactly a masterpiece. I rate this film 8/10."
5524,False,"Had to leave a comment about how deserving the Godfather 1+2 are to be number 1+3 movies in IMDb. It is my favourite film. I never get tired of watching this movie.Do i have to say that Al Pacino and Robert De niro are excellent and in time, historical actors?. More or less everything positive about this movie has been said. Rooting for the bad guys is imperative in the Godfather.If u haven't seen this yet,don't rent it just buy it(pt1+pt2),not the trilogy,pt3 is an insult to the other parts. Heres to another apprx.40yrs of people discovering this movie."
5525,False,"This movie is a timeless classic. I have never seen a movie that matches its excellence nor do I think I ever will. Brando rightfully deserved the Oscar he received for the movie (although his performance in On the Waterfront was better). The AFI list says Citizen Kane is the best movie of all time, but Citizen Kane doesn't come close to reaching the brilliance of the Godfather. Coppola got everything right and made the right choice of choosing the no-name actor Pacino (at the time) for the role as Michael. There was also James Caan and Robert Duvall that played their roles superb as well. I have probably seen this movie over 60 times and every time, I realize I'm watching a masterpiece in film. The character development is also outstanding. I would extremely recommend this movie to anyone interested in knowing about the great movies of all time. Superb 10/10."
5526,False,"This movie has everything, beautiful acting, strong directing, mind blowing script. I'll never forget this movie for many reasons, 3 already stated above and also the last reason is because its portrayal of mafia underworld couldn't be any nearer to the truth. I'll never get tired of watching it. The casting is perfect as no other actor could probably portray these characters better. This is due to the number of auditions and the right choice made by Francis Ford Coppola. The music is so perfect for this movie that it just draws you in.I still think Al Pacino deserved an Oscar for this because he obviously has done his homework here."
5527,False,"The perfect movie. Wish they could make some more like this! The perfection achieved in story, the drama and tension and stakes and the unbelievable performances by the entire cast, from top to bottom, add up to a theatrical experience, journey really, that achieves the potential we all hope for when we go to the movies. Amazing work that more than stands the test of time. I wonder if film producers and studios and directors today might take a cue from the film making process that was in place for this film. The freedom that Coppola had to put together his creative team, including many unknown actors in lead roles, even Brando at the time was considered un-hirable - was so critical to the success of the film. And yet today studios and producers think filling up their movies with ""names"" is the key to good film making, or film selling rather. But isn't film selling predicated upon having a good film to sell? So why not let the filmmakers fulfill their vision with the right characters, not the right names. We just need look back to films like this to see that part of what made them so great was the ability to fill them with actors that we could really believe were the characters they were playing. Not movie stars dressing up to sell tickets. It's just not the same out there anymore."
5528,False,"I had heard so much hype surrounding the Godfather movies but I had never seen them. I finally decided to sit down and watch the Godfather. Maybe my expectations were way too high before I watched it because everyone was regarding this as the greatest movie ever made. When I sat down to watch it, during the first hour I was bored out of my mind. It put me to sleep and I cut it off and decided to watch it later. A few days later I decided to watch the rest of the movie and started to realize the movie's greatness.If you get past the first hour the movie is highly entertaining with great dialog and great acting. Al Pacino is one of the greatest actors in American History in my opinion.Watching the movie the second time made me realize that this is probably one of he greatest movies ever. The character development is excellent and you understand that more upon the second viewing.In summary, if you haven't seen this movie don't expect to be blown away the first time watching. Let the movie develop and when the movie ends you will want to watch it again from the beginning to understand everything that happened. After that you would be hard pressed to deny this movie as one of the greatest."
5529,False,"This movie is solidly in the top 5 of ALL MOVIES that have ever been made and you could easily make a strong case for it being the best movie of every movie ever made. It was based on Puzo's best seller and the adapted screenplay from Puzo's work is absolutely sublime. It features one of the most stellar collection of actors every brought together for one film, with the performance of Brando leading the way. The cinematography is superb from the opening fade in back shot over Brando's shoulder {cat in lap} to the doubting stare on Diane Keaton's face as Al Neiri closes the office door in what works as what cinematographer's refer to as a closing wipe. Using the closing door to ""wipe "" the scene and end the movie, makes it one of the more recognizable and memorable endings to any movie.Sadly, younger people who grew up on movies that use special effects as a crutch, will not be able to comprehend that movies that are driven by a great plot line and outstanding acting are actually superior to effects driven movies.Giving this movie a 1 out of 10 deserves no less than one year incarceration for re-education training using another great 1970's movie approach in plot, the Malcolm McDowell forced open eyelid rectification in a "" Clockwork Orange"" , until the realization sinks in that movies like Spiderman or Jurasic Park while being very good are mere shadows to the great classics in movie history."
5530,False,"I was happy to see this on one of the cable channels the other day and we watched it. There was nothing dated about it. There we no special effects, no cookie cutter acts and scenes. It was a relief.A friend of mine, whose father left home when my friend was a little boy, adopted The Godfather as his missing dad. He watched it 25 times and quoted it throughout his life as the voice of a loving father who takes care of business. In a way it is scary, but also an amazing thing, that a film can raise a man.This movie has held the number one spot on my top ten list for most of my adult life. Western culture will remember it like we remember the works of Verdi, Rembrant and Shakespeare.Coppola can make all the wine he wants. He's earned it."
5531,False,"The Godfather, as so many before me, and so many after me will stipulate and emphasize is more than a family's way of life through crime. It not only projects the ironies, debacles, rises, falls and basic aspects of corruption but reveals the true meaning of family. Yes, it might seem odd and disturbing to allude to a people of invidious and ulterior principles to 'family', but when we characterize the word as an interface of love, commitment and connections through blood, no other type of portrayal is more symbolic than the Godfather. I will not bore and weigh my comment down through superfluous lines of the general story of the Godfather as so many others have done (and in better terms than I could possibly ever write). Rather, I will address a controversy which has spread amongst all fans of this enduring classic around the globe. In what way is the Godfather a reflection of family? Well.. to begin with the Corleones are family through blood. On a less literal level how does the Godfather epitomize the moral ethics of 'family'? The main component of a strong and progressive family is commitment. People may generally say 'Everyone knows that the most important part of a family is commitment', but this is where they are wrong. Most relationships in America are based on love or in a more ephemeral sense, infatuation. Commitment seems to be the more onerous and tedious part of love, simply because it is harder to sustain. In order to sustain a commitment one must be accustomed to routine. In order to get accustomed to routine it is imperative to have and hold an interest. Interest is where most love relationships break down because it simply cannot last. Most people are far too capricious to maintain an interest in anything (even as important as keeping a commitment in order to raise a family) for too long. This is where the forbearance of the Corleone family is outstanding. Through profitable business exploitation and singularly successful organized crime the Corleone's omnipotent infiltration of businesses often invoked anger in affiliate mafia groups seeking status elevation which ultimately resulted in the assassinations of Don Vito and Santino Corleon. Even at the breach of these two losses Michael Corleone readily steps up to the plate as the new Patriarch with rigor to supplant his former indifference. In just bloated proportions to 'ordinary' families in which commitment sacrifices time and money, commitment for the Corleones demands a greater sacrifice which is never too great for them to give. This is a sacrifice of life and security. Where the normal American family finds a sanction away from crime, the geography of their bounds is dwelled on by Corleones"
5532,False,"""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" Mario Puzo's 'The Godfather' is an epic, masterpiece. I mean it IS a forever classic! 'The Godfather' has influenced various films of today, like 'The Departed' and 'Smoking Aces'. Don Vito Corleone represents the true qualities of becoming one of the most established, respected figures in society's minds. Just after the release of the 1972 epic (which achieved 10 Academy Award Nominations and was named Best Picture), all ""gangster films"" were being judged by the style and look of this one, in particular. The strong performances, the director's unique technique and an excellent script, I believe, all play a role in 'The Godfather's' success worldwide. Italian-American director, Francis Ford Coppola introduces every major protagonist with a distinctive, complex individuality. Take Corleone for example, played by Marlon Brando. To me personally, he is seen as the most complicated gangster. He is not a killer, nor does he ever mix business with personal issues. He puts family first and doesn't like any weak people. Brando's performance as Don Corleone won him an Oscar and acknowledged him as one of America's greatest film actors.All men can relate to and understand Corleone's responsibilities of power he permanently has in his family, and how he juggles life as a father figure as well as remaining the boss of his inherited family business.The film opens on the wedding of Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). The wedding scene is a rather good indication, of how the Don's power expands over everyone in his world, from a regular next door neighbour to a killer. His son Michael (Pacino) has just arrived back from the war, in time to see his sister's wedding. Michael is portrayed as the younger, mature and quiet gentleman of the Corleone family. Given the chance as a husband, to take care of his wife, Kay (Keaton), he doesn't intend to become a part of his family's business and just wants to live a normal life. However, being the oldest in his family, gives Michael more responsibilities, which undoubtedly he can't escape from. Being a part of a big family, running a family business, enables Michael to have more family connections. The mise-en-scene and the cinematography are more dark and realistic. Even the sepia tinged colours are reminiscent of the year it is set in. In most Gangster films, the colour black is portrayed as being highly significant and is effectively manipulated in this case. For example; Corleone's main meeting/office room, where he makes all of his decisions: by having Corleone slightly hidden in pitch-black darkness, Coppola immediately creates that sense of enigma, sinister and chilling characteristics to Brando's Corleone. Francis Ford Coppola's themes in 'The Godfather' include family responsibilities, father's inheritance, the need to earn respect and the influence of power. 'The Godfather' is ideally aimed at a wide audience, except children of course; frequent Mafia violence for males, to a light-hearted, romantic tale between couples, for the females. The film effectively plays on the psychological mind, human feelings and emotions, which audiences can still accept and relate to, today.In comparison to other gangster genres, it was the first to introduce the gangster trilogy, with the film's continuous complex narrative that differentiates the importance of family. The representation of Italian ethnicity in 'The Godfather' was also new and innovative, under the conventions of a gangster film. I enjoyed watching this film in particular as well as the others in the three-part gangster saga. The Corleone family story seems so uninterrupted, if watched all together, in one go. I just love how the dialogue, comes out of the characters' mouths so truthfully. I even feel that as a whole, 'The Godfather' proves to be the greatest trilogy in cinema history. I'd have to say with pure, 100% Method Acting performances from both Brando and Pacino; this has got to be on the list of must-see films, without a doubt!"
5533,False,"In the beginning, The Godfather was the classic from the beginning. Francis Ford Coppola's epic masterpiece features Oscar winner Marlon Brando as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Coppola paints a chilling portrait of a Sicilian family's rise and near fall from power in America, and the passage of rites from father to son. He masterfully balances the story between family life and the ugly business of crime in which they are engaged. The Godfather along with the other films in the trilogy, had a strong impact on the public at large. Don Vito's line, ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse"" was voted as the second most memorable line in cinema history in a 2005 poll, called AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes by the American Film Institute. It is often used in a humorous way. Reports from Mafia trials and confessions suggest that Mafia families began a ""real life"" tradition of paying respect to the family don by kissing his ring, in imitation of the ending scene of the movie. There is no evidence of this custom being mentioned prior to the movie."
5534,False,"I saw this movie because of my father's recommendation. It was just a dramatical movie at first. The perfect revenge and the movie which is for all of gangsters. But, when I saw this movie again, I felt some other parts. Widely, there are two themes in the movie; one is about American dream and the other one is about many life of mafia. The last son of Don Colione, Michael doesn't want to join his father's business. But, after Don got hurt by other mafia's gangsters, the Don family came to be in danger. He couldn't help but assist them. And he finally realized his destiny and his family's fate. He became the leader of the family. He was as good as his father and his cruelty was better than his father. Finally, he became the best godfather in the mafia and he lost his old shape. Michael's father, Vito shows American dream's reality in the movie. Before he dies, he grows many vegetables that he wanted. He wanted to live normally, but he became a gangster as if his son. For his death and Michael's victory between family fighting, the movie continues the darkness of the society and bad side of American dream."
5535,False,"I honestly can't understand those who voted one star for this movie: probably they're trying to counter-balance the great number of 9 and 10 given by many viewers. This movie is complete, with very good actors, enchanting music and a nice plot. The behavior of the characters and their way of speaking is accurate, the atmosphere of the scenes set in Sicily is real and so is the portrait of a ""famiglia"" with that kind of activities. This movie is the ""standard"" for all the following movies about mafia and it created a collective imaginary about this subject like no other movie. Some parts may be a bit long, but if you start enjoying the moves, the glares and the dialogues of the characters you will like them just like the action parts. I don't know if this movie deserves to be #1 of all times but surely it's the best movie of the genre I've ever seen."
5536,False,"The Godfather is a story surrounding an organized crime family named Corleone in the 1940's. The patriarch, Don Vito Corleone, his loyal son Sonny, his daughter Connie who marries the abusive Carlo Rizzi, and his legitimate son Michael who is not involved in the family business. When Michael returns home from the war and Don Corleone is nearly killed by a rival gang, he slowly finds himself being sucked into the life. Though many people will say The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time, it's not. To tell you the truth, it's not an exciting movie at all. It's not action packed, and not a whole lot happens in its 3 hour running time. However, it is a brilliantly made film with some amazing acting, and portrays the most realistic view of the mafia in film history.Let's start off with the acting. Al Pacino who is now recognized as one of the best actors of all time got his start as Michael Corleone in this film. The movie mainly focuses on his getting sucked into the family business. Al Pacino plays the role brilliantly showing both his tempted side and his reluctant side. All of the supporting actors in this film are awesome. There are really solid performances by James Caan as Sonny who has the coolest scene in the film, and Robert Duvall as Tom. Of course, nothing bad can be said about the late Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone. This is Brando's most famous role and for good reason. His genius portrayal will go down in history as one of the greatest acting jobs of all time.The realism of the film is what also makes it good. This is the most realistic view of the mafia you will ever see on film. Most mafia films portray the action side of the story with all the hit men and explosions and gunfights. The Godfather doesn't show a lot of that. It focuses mainly on the business side of things. It shows how serious mobsters really are about their jobs.So, even though The Godfather isn't the greatest film of all time, it's one of the best made.8.5/10"
5537,False,"I just need to confirm the name and location of the restaurant in which Michael shoots/kills Solozzo and McCluskey:Is it Louie's Restaurant on Gunhill Road & White Plains Road in the Bronx????I have been in debate about this information with a friend. During the shooting of this movie, I was a teenager and working in a supermarket right across the street on White Plains Road & Gunhill Road and had the pleasure of watching it all.My friend claims that according to the book, it was on Arthur Avenue with a different name.I know that I am correct but could you please send me back an email confirming this info.Thank you, Mia Contardi 917-4327-5430"
5538,False,"What more could be said about the Godfather (1+2). The legacy of mafia crime family dramas begins and ends here. The lines of dialogue have been forever embedded into the American culture and film discourse. Pacino, Brando, Dinero, Keaton, Caan, and the whole cast fit the bill with impeccable conviction.The morals and themes of the pictures have such a profound impact unlike any preceding film. It empathizes with a traditionally antagonistic side of society and shows its varying dimensions. Men who steal, rob, and murder do so for reasons other than their own personal self-indulgence. They believe 'the life' is for the greatest benefit for their family, but then take it too far. Films up to this point had a narrow view of the motivation of the accomplices in organized crime. The Godfathers enlightened the film going public about the motivations of the mafia, crime and crime families but doesn't defend it. It merely observes the chosen and or inherit ethics of life in the crime family."
5539,False,"I heard a lot about this movie and very curious about this one and after watching the movie i think it is the most powerful and fulfilling ride one wants.It starts off very well but these are the turns which make that a wonderful experience. Lots of happening make in interesting and more importantly engaging. I strongly feel that this movie is not for those who do not like the revenge or the other way around about not found of mind games and politics.Now the hall mark is the acting of Brando which takes this to all time high. Alogn with this, Al Pacino did a well job. But music score of the movie needs a special mention. I still feel that the effect might not be that strong without such hammer strong music.In the end... just like to say... watch it ... again and again and always you will find something very special."
5540,False,"The Godfather (1972) Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Richard S. Castellano, John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, John Marley. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola.Spoilers herein.I don't think in all my viewings of movies have I seen such excellent direction, acting and writing. ""The Godfather"" is so brilliant in almost every way that I don't see how anyone could NOT call it a masterpiece. Michael Corleone, one of three sons of his mob boss father Don Vito, returns home from the war for his sister's wedding. Soon after his return, Don Corleone is wounded in a mob hit and Michael wants to strike back. Michael eliminates a corrupt cop and a competing mafioso in public, and escapes to Sicily. While Michael is gone, the Corleone family begins to fall apart.Marlon Brando gives a powerful and influential performance that is the best of his career with the exception of ""Last Tango in Paris"". Al Pacino also does very well, and he continues to do so in the later two installments of the trilogy. James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton also give great performances for the supporting characters. Coppola is smart with the directing as he doesn't make the film necessarily about shootouts or pure murders, though there is a big amount of violence, but instead he shows how it affects the people who have something to do with them. It is a series of ""family"" events that build up to a devastating ending. Nino Rota's eerie score highly adds to the atmosphere of the film.This film, it's sequel and ""Apocalypse Now"" were the only true modern classics that Coppola made, and launched the careers of Al Pacino and Diane Keaton, two of Hollywood's finest actors and two of my favorites. It is everything that films like ""Scarface (1983)"" tried to be and should have been, and without this film I doubt that ""Once Upon a Time in America"", ""Goodfellas"", ""The Untouchables"" and many others would have ever been made. ""The Godfather"" is the definite great film that should be viewed by anyone who calls themselves a cinematic movie buff. 5 stars out of 5."
5541,False,"This and Godfather II is my favorite of this trilogy. Since the time young Vito arrives at Ellis Island and gets his name changed to Corlione to establishing his Cosa Nostra empire is a human drama told in a grand scale. This is truly a story driven movie. Not the kind of ""fluff"" that people talk about these days where they take a picture, make the cinematography shot in low lighting, have couple of angry or troubled characters (mostly out of self pity) running around and calling it a serious and story driven plot line. The cinematography of this movie is beautiful, people are not overtly ""angry"" or ""troubled"" in any ways (their troubles, and angers are more real), but this movie has a real story to tell(!). This is the expensive original of the cheap imitation people are trying to hock around these days as story driven entertainment.There were days when few great film makers were trying to make money to make their passion - the movie - come into existence, not the other way around. This movie is one of them, and its substance shows. If you watch this movie, you will be treated to the best directing and acting money can buy. A true Gem of a Holly Wood movie making."
5542,False,"Derirative, contrived, moronic in parts, inexcusably slapstick, horrendously acted, monstrously ill-informed, soul-wastingly aimless, incompetantly structured, amazingly awful dialogue, virulently hideous casting, monstrous over use of toilet humour, inescapably stupid bodily function gags, insanely complicated plot, innumerable plot-holes, a myriad of anachronisms, baffling directorial ineptitude, spectacularly pretentious and alienating, superbly bad costumes, terrible make-up, manically dire soundtrack... ...are all NOT faults of this quite splendid gangster epic. Liked it quite a lot."
5543,False,"After spending three hours to watch the film, I think it was a good way to study violence, power and honor. Also the justice and crime in America.One of the center of the story is ""family"". In the film, there is one sentence""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man."". Family is always the best support. I think one of the reasons of the success of the Corleone's business is their good relationship of the family. every time they did their job, they have a good plan.The movie has the best actors, they can show the characteristic of the character, the whispering of Marlon Brando(the godfather), the smart and wise of Al Pacino(Michael), the stable of Robert Duvall(Tom)...The only weakness of the film is too long, nearly three hours, some of it was quite bore. Anyway, it was one the best movie I have ever seen."
5544,False,"This is the best movie ever made, alongside with Godfather part II. I have no words to describe this, it's simply wonderful. I can't find even one little flaw. How could I? The directing by Francis Ford Coppola is the best ever done, the acting by Pacino, Brando, Duvall and the rest are astonishing. The cinematography and script couldn't be done better. This movie, if people will live in earth for many centuries, ain't never gonan be forgoten. This is something that even in the year 3002, parents must show to their children, so they'd understand what means a masterpiece. The only movie who came close to Godfather I and II is Schindler's List. So 30 years gonna and only one movie came close.  The best movie ever made. 101 stars out of 100."
5545,False,"Clearly a film masterpiece in every sense of the word. Superb filming of each scene. From the moment of the opening line ""I believe in America"" by the desperate for revenge and justice undertaker Bonasera to the closing line ""Don Corleone"" by the loyal capo Clemenza the viewer watches art in the form of a motion picture."
5546,False,"I can't really describe accurately  how I feel about this movie. I have seen it so many times and every time I have enjoyed it more than the previous one. The plot, the music, the actors and actresses couldn't have played better roles. This movie was even better than the book which rarely happens in with other movies. No wonder why it movie has been ranked first."
5547,False,"To my opinion, the most overrated film of all times.An overrated story of an overrated person (America's infamous home grown terrorist), played by an overrated actor - Marlon Brando, which has almost nothing left from the juicy stud that made your lips wet in ""A streetcar called desire"".Rather than being a fine adaption of an anyway colorful book, and a playground for an impressive group of talents, the movie has not much else to offer. No one of the actors is at his/her best.Technically, Coppola is a genious. The best 2 dimension director. But his films always lack the 3'rd dimension. You're coming out great, Frank, but what exactly are you trying to say?"
5548,False,I cannot add anymore superlatives to the previous comments from IMDb subscribers.  This movie is the greatest.  I read the book twice before seeing the film.  The first time for the pure enjoyment of the marvelous storyline & dialogue.  The second time to reflect on Vito and Michael Corleone's management abilities.  Are they not CEOs?The movie - it's breathtaking.  I own the entire series and watch it whenever time allows.  Unfortunately I can rarely afford the six hours necessary to do so.
5549,False,"There is not a lot that can be said about the Godfather that has not already been said so i wont bother to give a description of what this masterpiece is about but i will mention a few thing about the acting. It is the acting in the Godfather that makes this film stand out not really the storyline. We see such actors as Marlon Brando,James Caan and Robert Duvall pull off some of their best performances of their careers but the final word must be left for Al Pacino. This is as far as i know Pacino's first real leading role and doesn't he grab the part by the horns! A Classic film that has not dated at all. 8 out of 10."
5550,False,Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect
5551,False,"look i understand how many people love this film; good acting, pretty solid storyline, etc... but one thing that is also a factor is what generation of movie audiences it is geared toward. i am a teenager, and while i do love guns, killing, and all that good ""teenage stuff"" that is in this movie, many people of my generation do not take such interest in mafia thrillers. i feel that they are a thing of the past, and therefor i do not identify with this movie in the slightest, and basically, don't love it as much as many people seem to. Having said this, i actually liked goodfellas more then the godfather, not because of the mafia ties, but the struggles that the man character underwent; struggles that i can identify with. this was something ""The Godfather"" lacked.again, its not bad... its just... OK"
5552,False,"I personally believe that Godfater is one the most boring but ""Famous"" movies of all time.The moment anybody hears the word GODFATHER they """"want"""" to believe that this is the best movie of all but in the real sense it is far from being great.People tell that AL Pacino got known by this movie but all he ever did was keep his mouth shut except for a few scenes unlike his other movies like Scarface,Heat,Devil's Advocate,Dog Day Afternoon etc.Even the """"great Marlon Brando"""" did not have much role in it.The entire movie is filled with conversation and nothing else.If there was A man in this entire planet who never saw or even heard anything about any movie,and you show him ""The Godfather"",I bet that he would probably go to sleep within the first 10 minutes.We the people of todays generation are made to believe that this is the best movie of all time by the media and other people.Honestly the only reason i saw this movie was to find out what the hell was there in it that is receiving so much appreciation.Guys who have not seen this movie might also be thinking the same that this movie is the best bit in reality,it is not.This movie is a very long piece of ****"
5553,False,"I tried to watch this film a couple of years ago... since it is so hyped, and I'd never seen it before, I thought it would be worth seeing.I was wrong.Seriously, I found it hard to stay awake during the film - and eventually had to give up just over halfway through, and find something more interesting to do. This is a shame, because quite possibly it might have got more interesting towards the end - but it did not retain my interest for long enough. I did see the infamous scene with the horse's head, expecting it to be some cinematic masterpiece, but... no, even that was an anticlimax."
5554,False,"If you want to see the quintessential american crime film?  Goodfellas. The Godfather is romanticized garbage in comparison.  Take a look at Coppolas' interviews about the godfather.  It is not a film he was passionate about doing, nor is he proud of the mafia legacy and he was a little bit insulted the studio thought he would do a good job just because he was Italian. Coppola purposely turned the story into a universal tale of a king and his family to avoid the broken, bloody and undressed view of the ""earners"" on the street.  He didnt want to focus on this, because of his aforementioned lack of pride.  He turned the mafia into a fairy-tale.Scorcese created goodfellas with passion and respect.  The line between good and evil was blurred, as it is in real life.  The good stories of the mafia dont come from the ""Don"".  They come from the ""earners"".  The guys in the trenches.  They are what keeps the wheel turning."
5555,False,"Even though I gave this film a three star rating (pretty high for me), I consider it one of the more overrated ever. Reviewers from some newspapers and magazines gave it strong advanced notices, and that got the ball rolling before other media and the public saw it. Plus it had almost an all-star cast headed by Brando, often considered the king of American actors of his generation. Granted Pacino and some of the others were young but most of the cast had some reputation going in.I know Coppola had not directed much if any but was known as a good writer, especially from ""Patton."" My gripe with the movie is it is basically an overblown melodrama with a lot of hype and gloss. The cinematography is good but not great. The acting: while a few minor people are good, Brando is terrible, mumbling more than ever with those cotton balls or whatever in his cheeks. Why did he think he had to play it this way? James Caan gives the best performance. And the flick is hackneyed, an old-time gangster one, full of violence and anger and crudeness. It is not film noir. They took the crime genre and Hollywooded it up, trying to make something grandiose. Two gangs pitted against each other, using gages and fifty caliber submachine guns. So what else is new? ""Little Caesar"" was better."
5556,False,"Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family ""business."" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug- trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisers Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl, Michael marries her, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered, having been betrayed by Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare. Once Michael has been groomed as the new don, he leads the family to a new era of prosperity, then launches a campaign of murderous revenge against those who once tried to wipe out the Corleones, consolidating his family's power and completing his own moral downfall. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather was followed by a pair of sequels"
5557,False,"The book is awesome, one of the best books ever. Sadly the movie is weak, and fails to portrait the true essence of the characters, what's so great about the book is that you're able to know and understand the background stories, therefore you identify with the characters behavior to the point where you even forget they're mobsters!! however in the movie many minor and irrelevant scenes take too much time, time that could be used to go a little deeper into the characters, and what's even worst is the total disregard to important passages of the book which didn't even make the movie, or if they did, they were over-synthesized. I don't think I'm the only one that really loved the book, but was sadly disappointed by the movie, still is a movie worth watching, but if you really want to enjoy a great story you should read the book!!"
5558,False,"Number one movie of all time?  Come on there isn't much goingon here.  It's strictly a movie for fans of ""actors"" and ""great casts,""as evidenced by the many user reviews that fail to find anythingelse to say about it.The story's long and dull, unless you happen to be obsessed withmafioso and the little details of Italain Americana of the period,which I must admit it captures well.  But there isn't really any soulor mystery to this movie.  It doesn't really even try to grapple withany issues.  (See Casablanca, or even Empire Strikes Back, andyou'll know what I mean.  You wanna see Brando acting?  ""On theWaterfront."" Now that's a movie with heart!)I think the real reason it stays ranked so high is that even peoplethat don't like it very much (like me) can't give it much lower than a7 or 8, because it is so strong in its acting, cinematography, andmise en scene.  Whereas the (few) people who don't getCasablanca find it so antique and alien that they feel free to vote itdown with 1s and 2s.  A real shame, that I think even Coppolawould admit.Oh, I'd even recommend Apocalypse Now over Godfather.  There'sjust so much more mystery and human story going on. Godfather's just about some violent stereotypes rehashed with a""redeeming"" sense of ""Family Honor."""
5559,False,One thing I will say about people one generation older then me. You don't like violent movies if they are about zombies or guys in mask with knifes or chainsaws. But when it is about guys with greasy hair with guns you can't get enough of it. The men from my generation come by it honest about enjoying violent movie. There is not one l.i.k.e.a.b.l.e. character in this crap. This is one of worst gangster movies ever. The only gangster movies that are worst are the sequels. This movie is a pile of pooh. It is not the best movie ever it is pooh pooh. Never never never see this movies. It is pooh. Pooh pooh. Pooh pooh. Don't wast your time. Don't wast your money. Pooh. It is about all bad guys kill each other. Boring. I want good guys in crime drama. pooh.
